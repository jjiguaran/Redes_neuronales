0	No sob story here. Just a hungry kid in college with not a lot of money and a lot of homework. (I have to translate 70 lines of Ovid love poetry. HELP ME OUT.
1	*note: I'm not actually desperate.  I realize that making you a song is a small thing, so I'm not going to ask you to send me a large pizza with lots of toppings or anything. Really, the most that I'm asking for is like a small pizza with no toppings. All I ask is that you keep the requests reasonable, and keep in mind that I'm not a millionaire, so I don't have access to a lot of things, such as realistic instruments like electric guitars or vibrant orchestras.  [Here's my soundcloud so you can get a jist of what my music sounds like, and the style I like to do.](http://www.soundcloud.com/slowfreq/)  NOTE: I'll PM you my address when I'm completed with your request.
1	Just moved to my first house and while I'm far from poor, the first swarm of deposits/bills has wiped me out and today is my first day off in two weeks since starting my job.  (X-ray Technologist at a 450+  bed Acute Care/Trauma hospital)    We are tired of soup and my roommate's stomach is quite a bit louder than my own.  http://i.imgur.com/Uwh0tXQ.jpg
0	Microwave is broken, have no sandwich supplies. Hope and Moral is running low.
0	Maybe a bit of a longshot here but, if anyone would be willing to chip in that'd be awesome. I could explain her situation in detail if you'd like to hear it. 
0	As it says, I have no job.  My diet for the last few weeks has consisted of ramen, cheese, mayo, deli meat and bread.   I can give you the sob story if you want, but i'm not going to put it here. Basically unemployed for the last 2 months, and no money.  I have 2 interviews set up tomorrow, and hopefully one of those will pan out.    This is a throwaway due to the fact that friends use reddit and know me.  I have a lot of humility, and I never ask anyone for help. I can verify that I am in fact a redditor (13 mo) and will return this favor to some other deserving candidate when I get the job tomorrow (because i'm going to get it of course).  Thanks.
1	Hi guys, never done this before so I don't know if it will work or not but worth a shot is it not? Basically the situation is as follows.. I am in Wellington, New Zealand. I am hungover because last night I was out in town drinking and watching the warriors lose to manly in the NRL grand final :( used up most of my spare money taxing home and now I am looking at a fairly empty fridge/pantry.. My car is 30 mins walk away and it is PISSING down with rain which I don't really wanna brave to go to the super market.  Pretty much wondering if a kickass random stranger would hook me up with a pizza to cure my hangover and cheer me up after yesterdays loss. Will be sure to pay it on in the future to another needy individual.  Thankyou THR - you are the greatest!
0	Hi everyone! I'm in the Nursing Program at a state college in Indiana, and I have practicals and a final for one of my Nursing classes tomorrow...As you can imagine my stress, a pizza that anyone could give me, I would greatly appreciate! Thank you! :)
1	Not really "starving," but I wouldn't mind something to break the monotony of rice and lentils on this gloomy day while I stud my jacket.

1	Hi first time posting here , I'm extremely hungry right now haven't eaten much today except junk food because there isn't much food at home I like.  I have a decent amount of allergies one of them being soy sauce but my mom still made Stir Fry which has it in it , No she is not a horrible person I just don't like getting heartburn anymore so I generally don't eat it. Fun Fact : I am actually allergic to chicken but can eat it 'Most of the time'.   I am also transgender not really looking for sympathy but the bar on the right says to list my current situation I also love Parkour that's about all there is to Know I am asking for just a Pepperoni pizza from Papa John's.  If I messed up at all in here please correct me I read the right side bar a couple times but I feel like I am fucking up.  Also my family is not poor feel free to give to someone else in actually NEED for the food I am just hungry and bored.
0	I know this is cliche, but I got into a car accident and getting it fixed emptied my account. I need the car to allow me to get to school and work. I am 300$ short on rent and am trying to sell of any non essentials in my apt. I have no food in my apt other than the condiments in my fridge. I hate asking but help would be greatly appreciated, and when i get back on my feet I would be glad to pay back the favor.  Im in San Marcos TX  If you want pics of the car, just ask. 
0	i have 3 kids and i live her ewith my husband we are struggling my husband just got laid off from work and i would just like something to be able to reward my kids to let them have something special.
0	First time posting. We're just hangin' out takin' turns playin' Skyrim and could really use some pizza or wings! 
0	No car and I refuse to waste money on gas station food when we were supposed to go tonight. But surprise surprise my friend dicked out on me again. So monday is soonest I will be able to take bus to the giant. Nothing in house except flour, lemonade mix and rice for next 2 days.  Someone make my day?
0	I'm going to the grocery store tomorrow, but as of now I have 4 slices of bread and some frostbitten ice cream. I also have not finished packing. I'm a terrible procrastinator. 
0	Honestly, it's almost comical at this point looking at this past week. The amazingness started off with school. I had been working on this massive art project, however I was far behind because no matter what I would do, my teacher would come back saying that personally didn't like it. Not that it wasn't good, she just didn't like it. This put me back roughly 3 days behind everyone else in the class. Come Monday projects are getting turned in, and I don't have mine done because of how far behind I was because of her. She said too bad and told me to better manage my time. Even the other students in the class told her she wasn't being fair and it wasn't my fault. I just say okay, and work to get it in as soon as I can. Tuesday comes. I go into work after class, and go to look at my schedule for the next week. I'm scheduled for 12 hours. I go to ask one of my managers what's up because I literally can't even pay for my gas to drive to work on those hours. Apparently someone decided to start a rumor about me at work that I was tired of working there and that I was bad-mouthing the managers. Instead of coming to talk to me, they listened to the rumors and cut my hours. Wednesday comes around. I'm on my to school when my car starts acting funny. I'm on my way to class, and am almost at the school, so I just try and get the school where I can look at my car. I'm in the parking lot getting ready to pull into a spot when my car dies. Steam starts coming out from under the hood, I knew it had overheated. My temp gauge didn't show it was overheating so it told me that my thermometer was broken. I call my dad and tell him I'm stuck at the school, he says when he gets a chance he'll bring a thermometer up to me and we'd replace it at the school. I wait 20 minutes, start the car up again,  pull into the closest spot, and go to class. I come out from class and look under the hood. Radiator is empty and the resevoir tank is massively overfilled, leading to the thermometer again. I put water in my radiator, and try to start my car; nothing. I try again, hear a loud bang, get a big puff of smoke, and my car dies. I just cracked the engine block, meaning my car is dead. As a side note, my school and work is 40 minutes away one from where I live. I cannot live without having a car. So now I'm having to borrow my dad's car. Next comes Thursday. My parents are going through a very bad divorce, and my dad was having to travel to a different state for the trial. I get a call from him late in the afternoon, in which he's very upset with me. The day before I told my mom about my car, and told her I was using my dad's car, and then she asked how my dad was going to the trial. This was where I made my mistake: I told her that he was using his company credit card. Apparently she used this information in court against him, and it wasn't something even his lawyer knew about. Now my dad is upset with me because he thinks he can't say anything to me because I'll just go to my mom. I'm not talking to my mom right now because she took something I told her because I thought she would be concerned about me and instead just used it to her own advantage. Thankfully Friday and Saturday were pretty uneventful because I don't believe I could handle any more disappointment this week. Sorry for the rant, but it was kinda therapeutic to get it off my chest. It's nice to know that there are a couple people out there who will read this just so I'm not the only person who has to carry this shit. Even if I don't get any pizza, it's nice knowing that fact.  TL;DR: Cunt teacher, rumors at work leading to cut hours, cracked engine block, can't talk to either of my parents right now. Just another average week. 
1	The title pretty much explains it. I live in New York and flying home to CA for the week isn't worth the expensive plane ticket, and my personal income is quite dismal as a college student, so any Spring Break destination is out of the question. I understand that a lot of people are in the same situation and that it probably isn't the best time to ask for help, but I thought might as well try. It would really be appreciated!
1	**Edit:**  I received a gift card from a fellow redditor.  Thank you so much for the generosity!  I will definitely pay it forward when I get a chance.  I was out of state for a semester of school and returned a few weeks ago.  I was finally offered a job on Friday but I still have to wait for background checks to go through before I can officially start next week (or so).  I'm babysitting my nieces for my brother who happens to work at a dealership across from my apartment so any food will go towards feeding the girls and my brother as well.  My brother is also trying to get back on his feet as well after a divorce so he is unable to pay me for watching the kids.  Now, after that sob story, I will say we are not DYING for food.  If you find someone else in greater need, by all means help them first.  Food would greatly help me save money until I officially start my job, considering I still have to wait another 2-3 weeks for a paycheck to come in.  If I do receive any food, I definitely plan to pay it forward once I am more financially stable.    This turned out a whole lot longer than I planned.  I would appreciate any help. Thanks!
0	I've just heard that my girlfriend, her parents and best friend have just experienced a car break in and had a variety of expensive things stolen. They're still waiting for the police (many hours now) and I have not eaten. It would be cool to put smiles on their faces.
0	hello i am requesting that someone please buy me a pizza my moms not here so i have nothing to eat :). i'll appreciate it very much
0	I'm new here and skeptical but I love pizza and I guess there's nothing to lose, so... my gf and I are gonna watch a movie tonight! Would you like to buy us a pizza? Holler @ your boy!
1	***************I already posted before but I forgot to put "request" in the title. Not scamming.***********  My name is Jonathan. My mother and I receive food stamps in the state of Arizona. We get them on the 7th of every month. Normally they last but this month we had some trouble stretching them out. Today is the 6th and we have no food left in the house and we are just one day away from receiving our food stamps. Enough for one pizza for tonight would be great. That's all we need. We'd appreciate your help. We can give any verification that would be needed.
0	My wife and I aren't paid until the weekend and money's pretty tight at the moment.   Any help would be greatly appreciated.
1	it has been a very hard pay period for me and my family and dinner for tonight would be greatly appreciated. I will gladly pay it foward on friday if someone can take care f of me today. thanks
0	we are broke and she has no health insurance and we are starting to freak out about how we will pay this bill when it comes. She is a wreck and all i want to do is see her smile and there is one thing that does this and it is pepperoni pizza. Thank You RAOP!   P.S. She doesnt know i am trying to do this, and she is a redditor but doesnt know of this subreddit, so let's keep this between us for now.
0	I've been a fool with my money basically. I'm a student in London in my first year. I'm getting a ride home on Wednesday but until then i'm out of pocket and VERY hungry. A slice would be very appreciated.
0	We are 5 broke freshmen at Champlain college, living in a 5 man room, we missed dinner due to class and could really uses some pizza. 
1	Not to be cliche, but I'm a broke, last-year college student trying to get through the night. I would be more than willing to pay it back/forward after I get my check next week from my job. School starts tomorrow and I will have meal plans, so no worries for the rest of the semester. Feel free to check my account, it's over three years old and I participated in Secret Santa and Arbitrary Day if that gives any credibility to my intent in hitting someone back. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this.
0	   I have been dieting in order to test for a gluten intolerance, but it looks like wheat and barley doesn't phase me after all.  Recent studies have shown that cats can see blue and green. There is disagreement as to whether they can see red.
0	My friend has the house to himself, so we're doing a Marvel heroes movie marathon at the house. Unfortunately, due to us being poor bastards, the meager food we bought to begin with disappeared yesterday.  What's a movie marathon with no food??  **There's only 6 of us** so it's not a big group. Anything we get will be appreciated!  Please, thank you, and keep being awesome, RAOP. I'll return the favor when I get work.
0	Reddit, you are great.  Hot Pizza sounds really good,  No sobs, just hungry.                                                      ~McNicken 
0	Hi there, tried this once before without any luck but I think today is worth another try. Finished exams and I think a pizza would really be the best meal tonight, no effort and delicious! Thanks for reading
0	I'm not going to lie, my roommate and I are pretty hungry tonight. We've been living off of ramen for a few weeks, and I honestly can't stomach any more. I'll be picking up my first paycheck in two months on Friday, and that in itself is a wonderful feeling. For now, I can hear my stomach yelling "pizza". I'm hoping someone could help us with a good meal tonight. We're both out of money, and I can provide proof of my overdrawn account if requested. Thank you all for reading.
0	SOOOOO hungry. Broke college student at UNCC just done with finals and would love a pizza!   I work part-time and live paycheck to paycheck for now :(   Will pay it forward this weekend once check hits bank!   THANKS! 
0	I live in Victoria BC so it can't be papa john's or stuff like that... we have pizza hut and domino's and uhh.. panagopolous... also i have no digital camera unfortunately to show you how pathetic I look.  I'm sure there are tons of empty promises to be found in these pages but I will buy someone else a pizza(or two) when I get my second paycheck.  This is my longterm account so you can harass me and badmouth me if I don't do it (check my profile if you must but please don't read my messages... a lot of them get downvotes and I wouldn't want you to think less of me).  I don't have children and I will not starve to death without a pizza tonight.  Here's the TIL: it's a neato QM experiment http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elitzur%E2%80%93Vaidman_bomb_tester
0	Roommates and girlfriend out of town, sitting here broke with out pizza. If it happens, it happens, and I'll be eternally grateful. If it doesn't happen I'll eat something else.
0	Just when I thought me and my children were not going to make it I just got a call for a job and start monday. The money I have is a little tight and would love to get some pizza for me and the kids to celebrate our life on the right track. Thank you
0	Well, I'm hungry, and my mother is pretty poor for the past few months so my dinners consisted of poptarts or ramen for the last month or two. Would be nice if I could get a pizza from Dominos or something tonight :].   Edit: forgot to say my location is Long Island (NY)
0	So Here's the lowdown, I'm a 23 M fresh out of the army. April 17th 2013 and we are living with my wife's parents until we can get on our feet. I have been expecting my last paycheck for a while now but it seems long to come. Both of her parents are in their 70's and living on retirement checks so i feel really bad about being here. But we have no where else to go. I will have money soon but not in time for it to help. (Pulling my Tsp, Retirement) and what not. I have 1 boy 2 yrs and a pregnant wife and 2 older people, one on oxygen. I would love to be able to do something nice as a treat for them but i have no money. Anything would be amazing, I'm not saying we Need it but i would rather not eat bean soup again and give us something nice to talk over. You can call me and we can talk a bit, if you are willing to help, or even if not Just message me. Thank you in advance anyone willing to help.
1	Hello! Normally we would never do this, but we (me and my girlfriend) were hoping someone might be nice enough to buy us a pizza tonight?   Normally we wouldn't be in such hard shape, but delays in receiving my paycheck and some crazy insane overdraft fees (THANKS TCF!) have left us with a grand total of $2.50 between the two of us until Sunday.  We promise to pay it forward to another needing person next week when we are finally in the black again. I can send you proof of that if you would like. I used a throw-away for this post, but I would have no problem verifying my identity to anyone gracious enough to help.   So, if you might be interested in helping us out let me know. We will be browsing /r/aww in the mean time, keeping a smile on our face and positive attitude on this whole situation. Thanks!
1	We're completely broke and craving pizza. I thought I was super smart and ordered Domino's gift cards on Walmart.com with my Paypal - they aren't going to be e-delivered until tomorrow! Payday is Friday, and we don't have any money for groceries until then... but I will reciprocate! I will also send a homemade candle if someone wants... if you're kind enough to feed hubs and I, let me know if you'd like one, and I'll let you know the scents that we have available.   Thank you!
0	I graduated from college in December (yay!) without help from my family and relocated from the devastating economy of Michigan in hopes of better opportunities. I've spent all my money on bills and gas for the last week to go to interviews, which unfortunately, leaves me with nothing left for food. I'd love to not go hungry tonight... and hopefully one of these interviews results in a job &amp; I can pay it forward ASAP. ♥
1	Fiance was laid off a month or so ago so money was already tight before we had frozen pipes burst in our basement a week ago.   Our idiot landlord is dragging his feet on getting things fixed. We haven't showered in days, and have no more clean dishes to eat or cook anything on/in.  If somebody would be kind enough to order us some pizza, we would gladly pass it forward when our taxes come back.  There is a Pizza Hut and a Dominos nearby.  I also posted on the other RAOP.  That isn't against the rules is it?
0	EDIT: Forgot to include location, which is CHICAGO SUBURBS!  My parents just went out to dinner, and I just realized that we aren't getting groceries until tomorrow, so I'm prettttty hungry.  These allergies are pretty awful, but I have some unfinished video games that I can revisit while I'm here, so it's not all bad.  But can you awesome people of RAoP make it better?  :D  It would make my night to be saved by reddit.   P.S. I've never done this before, so I don't really know how the verification system works.  I'd be happy to use it if you explained it to me though :)
0	I'm just your avrage poor high schooler pulling an all night study sesh, will happily pay you back this friday when i get paid, the pizza's half priced too because i work there! Thank you so much for your time!
0	Graduating on April 28th, I love pizza.
0	I just got my money stolen today and that was my money for food the next 2 days that my parenrs are away. can anyone help out with a pizza?          It would be hugely appreciated. (My dog would be very appreciative as well.)  Also, location is The Delaware county area of Pennsylvania.
0	So I'm chilling at home right now playing some League of Legends, and for this week apparently my timesheet hadn't switched from "Temporary EMployee" for working over the summer over to the regular "Student" pay, semester has started. No pay for this week and am craving some pizza! Anyone wanna help a brother out? Willing to gift a champion or skin in return :)
0	Umm, I'm hungover as hell, hungry as hell and poor as hell. I don't really have anything to give, but I do have a free copy of Europa Universalis 3 with all of the addons etc I can gift via steam if anyone would like it!
0	Left me here to go have fun at my parents cabin. I had to stay behind due to work obligations. Pizza would be nice. Very low on money. Would be greatly appreciated.
1	Hey, folks. I'd really hate to ask for any assistance from anyone, especially since there are more needy people out there, but we've kind of hit a snag and could really use the help.  Here's the deal: I'm 22, and I live with my mom. We've been going through some pretty rough times as of late -- we're knee deep in debt, going through a foreclosure on our home, and we've been living paycheck to paycheck for months on end. Mom works part-time at a hospital, and I've been looking for work for quite awhile, but as of yet nothing's come up. We've been living on what food my mom can get from her work (employees can get food in exchange for 'payroll reduction', where they take the charges right out of their paycheck), but this week's pay cycle just ran out, meaning we can't get any more food there until this coming week. Groceries haven't been a realistic possibility with our income lately, so until then, we're out of luck (and food) this weekend. We've got twenty dollars in the bank to cover gas, but that's about it.  In addition to all of this, my mom suffers from a myriad of health issues, so between that and all of the stress from our financial situation, she feels absolutely miserable. I'm hoping that maybe some delicious pizza would at least take her mind off things and brighten up her day a bit.  Again, I feel awful asking for help,  but any at all would be greatly appreciated, and when we can afford it, we will definitely be able donate a pizza or two here.  
1	We have basic groceries (though not much) until I get paid at the end of the week, but it's going to be a long, busy week for both of us and I would really love to take her for pizza. We have a Pizza Hut sort of nearby. I know it would cheer me up immensely. Thanks for reading. 
0	Would like a break from noodles. God. The noodles. They're everywhere. 
0	The toppings do not matter to me. I will eat almost anything.
0	I just paid my rent. Don't get paid until Friday. $0.87 in my bank account until then. Boyfriend is at work until late, and I have no transportation, or money for that matter. This would make my whole day.   Anything is appreciated. :)
0	I'm not going to Burning Man, I'm staying home to build a foundation for myself and find some gainful employment.  Edit: Also, y'know, I can't afford to go to the other side of the country and all that jazz.
0	i don't know how this works...but pay check isn't coming in till Monday. no money now and a pizza would be awesome for the spirits.  
0	I don't really have a sob story or anything. I paid my rent last weekend and have $7 left - I'm normally more prepared money-wise for The Post-Rent Week (TM), but wasn't so lucky this time. I planned for this by stocking up on Ramen and canned soup, but I had food poisoning over the weekend so I'd really love a real meal instead that I can likely spread out over 2-3 days. Cleaning a friend's apartment tomorrow night for cash so that'll get me through the rest of the week for gas and stuff.  Basic info, if it matters (first time requesting): 23, non-student, work full-time, live alone w/ 3 cats, obsessed with Harry Potter and mancala.
0	Hi, I'm a college student in Toronto. I've been saving for a while to go to school and my 2nd half of tuition is due in a month. I moved from my hometown so I had to give up my job and I am having alot of trouble finding a new job in my new home. And I would really appreciate a pizza :)
0	A friend asked me if I had some spare cash to help him cover his electric bill, as he recently lost his job. I checked my bank account and saw that I had the money to spare, so I paid his electric for him. Little did I know that payments I had made to other bills hadn't hit my bank account yet (stupid on my part to not verify this) so now I'm a bit in the hole! I'd planned on buying lunch at the cafeteria here at work, but my card was declined. Anyone out there willing to Pizza me? I'll be able to pay it forward on Friday (Pay day)!
0	im strugglin out here livin with my mom whos never home cause she works all the time. anything would be appreciated,  please and thank you, god bless.
0	My job cut my hours and I'm living off ramen and peanut butter. Riding my bike looking for a new job the last two day's has got me pretty tired. If some one can help me out, it would make me extremely happy. 
0	Some pizza would be a lovely way to cheer up :) I posted in /r/randomactsofpizza on Friday but nothing came of it, so I figured it might be OK if I posted here.
0	Hey RAOP. Terrible, awful, no good day that may just get worse. No money in my wallet, the $100 paycheck I'm getting today is going to pay my $200 of bills, so obviously no food. Please, help. I will pay it forward ASAP.  Thanks.
0	Horrible day at work, shitty relationship, and roommates from hell. I just want to believe in life again! Please make my night. 
0	I am currently only attending college due to a full scholarship. A nice cheese pizza would be greatly appreciated!  *first time asking for food
0	Fish is just awful all fish, lets just go with anything that lives in water and is edible. Can anyone help me out?
1	**EDIT! The wonderful Hrnmyd has provided me with the pizza I asked for! THANK YOU SO MUCH!**  I just started college in Virginia and there was a mix-up at the unemployment office, so I have no money for books, bills, rent or food. My girlfriend and I are currently living on ramen noodles. It's been two weeks now and the Unemployment Office still hasn't set things right.  Come February, my GI Bill money should start rolling in and I'll be able to pay for rent, food, books and everything, no problem. Once the money comes in, I promise to pay it forward TWICE.  If anyone is willing to help us get over this hump, I would greatly appreciate it. And like I said, the favor will be repaid twice. Thank you.
0	I have been out of work for some time now and have a really hard time taking care of myself. I have barely made it by paying my rent let alone eating. I heard about this site A while ago and gave this a try to no luck. If someone has work or a way they could help, it would mean the world. god bless.
1	I'm a broke college kid working a part time job at Kohls and they said something got messed up with the system and I have to wait for my paycheck. I'm haven't been able to buy groceries yet and I'd appreciate a pizza :)
0	Hi, we're not broke but not living a kings life either, very far from it. we are just feeling a little lethargic today and having a pizza delivered would be amazing, but pay day isn't until friday. We would love to have a pizza and will pay it forward come the weekend when pay has been received. We may have some herb that is inducing such cravings and laziness at the same time as well, so this really would be awesome! Help a friend out ya kno
0	Just got my first job at a dry cleaners and I have only eaten a single grilled cheese sandwich all week. Boss doesn't want to pay me for the first week so I'm broke tell next week! As soon as I get my pay check I will buy someone a pizza! PLEASE HELP!  PM me please. I've been browsing reddit for years and I really need some help right now, Thanks!
0	I thought I would get my check today, really could use a pizza. Thanks.
0	Single mom of 4 and one on the way. Money is running out and my kids deserve a treat (pizza) after all they have been through and then some! THANK YOU! :-)
0	I'm living with my sister, and have been looking for a job. I've been giving guitar lessons so I can pay for whatever food I can buy on my own.  My sister and them barely get by, and there are some days when the kids have nothing to eat.  I've been buying ramen and large packages of mushroom soup and crackers. Mushroom soup has gone from my favourite food, to making me sick.  I live in Canada. Winnipeg, MB.  Got a lovely chicken, onion pizza, and a pepperoni and sausage pizza, with some cheese bread courtesy of **birdnoir**  Best meal I've had in awhile.
0	Anyone willing to donate a pizza? Would really like to share it with my friend. Nothing to eat at his house and I'm gonna be here the whole weekend. Any donations would really be appreciated :D I live in the Atlanta area in Georgia.
1	Hey RAoP. Tomorrow is my 22nd birthday, and I'm barely able to eat. I just recently got a job after moving here a few weeks ago, and haven't been paid or had any money at all to spend on decent food. Even worse, I suffer from Crohn's disease, and not eating is making my stomach flare up like you wouldn't believe. I could really, seriously use the food right now. Thanks for the consideration.  Edit: Pizza'd! Thank you, ninjaliwa!

0	Long story short, been looking for a job to no avail - bills are adding up, and I've got very little money for food this month. Also - food stamps have not been gotten yet, went today to the DHS but don't have an appointment for another 2 days.   If anyone could help out I'd really appreciate it, I can make a drawing or write you a poem, lend you a book, anything!  
0	I've been watching breaking bad all day trying to catch up to everybody and im starving, the show is too good to leave the couch, plaise halp!
0	Hi, Reddit:  I have no idea if my reason is considered a proper reason for asking for a pizza, so forgive me if this seems like a lame request, haha.    I forgot my wallet at home this morning and went to work.  Now I'm in the office and I don't have lunch.  Would really like a small pizza or just a slice to tide me over until I can go home tonight.    
0	**I can't tell you when the last time we actually had Pizza in our house. We never have any extra money for any kind of Take out and my  almost 2 year old Daughter loves Pizza.   A Pizza would be so nice on a day like this. Asking for some kind heart to get us a Pizza to indulge in since we can never seam to catch a break where we could treat our selves in one.  -Thanks :D**
0	I'm stuck on the Campus of Lee University in Cleveland, Tennessee with literally no money. I have a meager musical talent, and I would sing you a song if my computers microphone worked. I have no idea what else to offer. 
0	I'm a decently skilled desktop support/network tech and just haven't had any luck. I've resorted to trying to get my old magazine sales/retention job back.   A simple pepperoni pie would go a long way.  Even a Papa Murphy take and bake would make my day.  
0	I'm a Georgetown student, and I have an orgo exam tonight. I'd sure love a pizza to help dry my tears when I'm done with it.
1	Planned on having some good old beans on toast for dinner but the bread has gone off and I have no money to pick some up
0	I cant pay my bills, much less pay for food. Ive been eating Thanksgiving leftovers everyday, which is pretty good eating. At least its not Ramen noodles or toast everyday. But I feel the cheezyness could raise my spirits enough to get thru the rest of the year.  The favor would surely be forwarded when I get back up on my feet.  Luvs ya, fellow Redditors.
0	Earlier this week I had a $115 water bill due to error and I do not know if I have to pay it or not. I am on a fixed income with three kids and three adults living under one roof, I have very little food in the cupboard and fridge with my food pantry giving out food next week.  My kids are tired of sandwiches and pasta (which my live in baby sitter makes while I work all day). I do have a verification code but no camera for proof because I cannot afford one. 
1	[cowabunga!](http://imgur.com/LufK0) Does anyone know what "Bodacious Slicage" means?  Young family with 2 kids here; its Pizza or oatmeal for dinner tonight :-/.
0	See above :) It'll probably take me a while to save up enough money as I don't make a lot. In the meantime, I'm stuck on food stamps and can't really afford a nice, hot pizza. Getting sent one would really be appreciated! :)
1	I'm a student and I'm a little low on cash for the next few days and would love a pizza right now. I promise to tell you at least one scientific fact about the physical world that makes you go "No! That's not true" even if it means I have to spend all night going through my stack of textbooks.  I spent all of my money doing [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/j7s3u/offer_anyone_need_anything_from_the_uk/). I was reimbursed via paypal but I stupidly made a transfer to my bank account so that money is lost in limbo for the next 2-3 working days.   I've just come across this subreddit and I will be buying at least one pizza next week for someone independent of the outcome of this request. What you guys do here is awesome! 
0	Oh my gosh I am starving and all i can think about is food right now. I've run out of food stamps and I've had pretty much the worst birthday ever today.   I haven't eaten anythingand the food closets don't have any distribution locations near any of my bus routes till the end of next week.   Can sent pic of ID as verification, but really I could use any kind of help :-\
0	I wanted to say I'm absolutely heart broken, but didn't want to give the wrong impression.  I don't know why, buy my best friend that I've spent all of the last year spending every free second with, suddenly wants very little to do with me and is causing me to feel extremely left out with all of our mutual friends.  Plus, I've honestly never loved someone more than her, so I don't know if I've ever hurt this much before.  It's terrible and confusing.  On top of that, a couple friends suddenly suffering from massive depression, drug use, and self harm, trying desperately to take care of them and am just so so drained and lonely because of everything.  Just trying to get past these next two weeks with tons of school work and exams, so hoping for some pizza or just some Reddit love and motivation would help with the loneliness and anxiety.
0	My kids love pizza but unfortunately I haven't been able to afford it lately :-( if anyone would be willing to get us pizza we would be so happy! I'm not sure how this works but we have both a dominos and papa johns close to us! Thanks in advance  Exit: we are located in southern New Jersey also here is a linkto a photo of my children http://imgur.com/qVN1Q.jpg 
0	Just a normal guy here that is low on cash (no more then $30 to last me the rest of the month) and is craving some pizza.  Since I'm in Sweden it might be a bit tricky but I do have a paypal account. I've been thinking about buying someone a pizza here for a while and I'll be sure to return the favor as soon as I get my paycheck :).  Cheers guys.
0	Hey I posted in another post but haven't heard anything, so here it goes.  Here's my story; I am a 21 year old starving college student who currently doesn't have enough money to eat.  I had to pay double rent this month as well as the next and to top it all off, got a urinating in public ticket on my 21 run! FML to the fullest.  I'm a new user because I was just introduced to this community this week. My friend then helped me set up an account when she heard I haven't eaten anything but hot pockets this past 2 weeks.  Would really appreciate a pizza for a change. Thanks for reading!
0	I am currently broke and working full-time, I am hungry and Dont get paid till Friday, If you could help i would appreciate it. I live in Springfield Mo. 
0	I was depending on my tax refund for food, but it appears that is tied up in a dispute I'm having with DFAS. A large pizza for my boyfriend and I would be appreciated.
0	I live in Texas and I'm really hungry. I would appreciate any help I can get. 
1	Hello. This is my first time on this subreddit, because I usually have enough money to order, but this time, I don't. So thanks to anybody who is a fellow pizza-lover, and pizza on!
0	I'm brand new to reddit and just found this sub-reddit.How neat and what a good idea. Could someone show us  some pizza love? We rarely get an opportunity to order pizza and the gesture would be really nice.
1	Hey ROAP, I've been lurking here for quite a while and finally have decided to ask for some help. I am currently about 40 dollars in the hole in my bank account (miscalculation of bills) and hardly any food in the house. I could sure use a fresh hot pizza tonight! I can pay it ~~back~~ forward when I get paid. Would make going to work tomorrow so much easier. Reddit is the best!  I can PM details and proof if you want. Thanks RAOP!
1	So I'm one of those American working poor, my paycheck on friday all went toward rent (which I was behind on, didn't want to be on the streets) and other bills such as power (my state has some of the highest power charges on the west coast, so it's not cheap no matter how much you conserve). Anyway, I had enough left over to buy a few packs of ramen which is ran out pretty fast. I went to my local food bank after work (not above getting help there), however they closed at 3 today (normally they close at 5). I'm going tomorrow after work but am very hungry. Sorry for the long post but if anyone is willing to give I'd be grateful. I'd be willing to provide any proof I can give. Cheers
0	I got off work an hour ago and all I've had since Thursday is pasta. That ten is for gas. Would really love some cheesy deliciousness.
1	My friend has a foot condition that he was born with. He was operated on one of his feet last year, and they just finished the other one yesterday! He needs to go through a recovery period of two weeks before he can start walking again, and I'd like to brighten up his day with a pizza because I can't visit him today (when two of my other friends are going).  He's not in any real need, but I think it'd be a nice thing to do since he's just an all-around great guy and taking this like a champ (and always willing to offer us food!)
1	Hello RAoP!  My fiancé and I have been living on cereal, grilled cheese sandwiches and jello for almost 2 week now. Our [fridge](http://imgur.com/pXp9j) is bare aside from the essentials (milk, cheese, bread) and will remain that way until the 3rd. I'm okay with eating this way for a couple more days but my guy is going crazy. He just went off to work with a sack lunch of the usual and made a comment about how his stomach is shrinking and it made me feel bad. I was thinking about a hot meal I can make (for us for when he got home) with what we have but there's not much. Plus, I have a fussy baby on my hands. We have an 8 month old who is a high risk infant so she gets a monthly RSV shot to prevent her from getting the nasty virus. She's been a handful since yesterday :(  I've never requested a pizza here before and we aren't really the types to splurge on eating takeout. But if I had the money I'd do it today, as it would raise our spirits. I just got my verification code so if anyone can hook it up I would greatly appreciate it! I would also pay it forward as soon as I'd be able to :)  Thanks &lt;3  
0	I'm broke as a joke and starving right now.  I've used up the little money I had left over the past few weeks, and don't really know how I'm going to make it through the next few weeks.  I would love to sit down with a nice warm pizza tonight and just say f**k it all.
1	I just got home.  Checked my mail.  One lone piece in the box.  A very recognizable SASE.  In it, nicely folded in thirds, was my divorce decree.  Nothing else, just a little certificate.  I know what it is, but I read it over anyway, cause hey, it hurts more if you let the words fully sink in.    Yesterday was my birthday.  One day you're 36, the next day you're divorced.  Not that I had many choices, but I was going to cook dinner tonight.  Now I don't want to do anything.    I had to borrow $100 today to cover all the checks I mailed out on the first including rent.  I don't get paid until next week.  The divorce wasn't cheap, and now I get to officially make her payments every month.  The fun never ends.  I thought hey, I'll just get a pizza.  Oh wait no, my life is a mess and I have no money.  If anyone can help me out, I'll be sure to do the same for someone next week.  If not, just tell me it's going to get better.
0	I'd really appreciate it :).. I have $3 for 2 weeks.  There is a Pizza Hut very close by me, but I'm not picky :)
1	Guys, even though I work two jobs and go to school full time money is always tight and sometimes I run out. This week is one of those times. I havent had anything to eat today except for a couple of snacks I could scrounge from a friend's house. Any way someone could help a fellow out?
0	Hey guys, just stumbled upon this subreddit and was amazed that this even existed, i never knew other people had the same addiction as me! anyway if anyone wishes to do this i will be very grateful and i can go to bed knowing that there are some awesome people out there! and i will repay to the next poor soul who gets the shakes from pizza withdrawal as we all know its a serious condition.
1	Hey. Im 19 and I live in California. Im inbetween jobs and waiting on my EBT card. I have no money at the moment. A pizza would really help fill an empty stomach
0	It's been a long day, my husband was up all night sick and my two year old has been sick with the same thing the last week. Just at the end of my rope and could really use a break. Thanks!
0	We are broke till thrusday and have nothing to fix at our house We would LOVE some pizza could somone PLEASE help WILL pif (Pay It Foward)  We live in NC we have no gas to pick it up so it will to be Delievered
0	So I basically am not starving or dying or have been hit by a storm but I had pizza for my brothers friends coming over but my friends took the frozen ones i bought the other night... so basically if you wanna help a brother out in the next few hours that would be great haha!
1	I havent eaten all day, I would love to eat something tonight. First time requester, please be nice :)?
1	Hello. I've never posted in Random Acts of Pizza before, so I apologize if I'm not doing this correctly.  I'd love to surprise my wife with a pizza tonight if I could.  She worked from 4pm to 1am on Monday, and Tuesday. She then went back to work this morning (Wednesday) from 9am to 5pm.  Money is pretty tight in our household right now, and she has my debit card so I cannot surprise her myself. But she has been working really hard lately. I've very proud of her, and I want to see her rewarded for her efforts.  I work a "normal" 8-5, M-F job. So this will be the first time since Sunday we'll be at home together while not being unconscious. I hope this works out!  ( I don't know if any of the stuff below matters, I'm just trying to be thorough.)   We live in a college town, so there is a Pizza Hut, Domino's, Papa John's, and Papa Murphy's. No olives or peppers please. (She hates the first, and the second gives me acid reflux.) 
0	Today has been awful, I have no money, I got a bill in which I can't pay, I have no food in my house and to top it all off rent is due. A pizza would be amazing right now. Im in Londonderry - Northern Ireland
0	Could pizza it forward by sunday. 
0	I've been eating a very limited meal after the typhoon hit my city. I hope somebody is willing to send me a pizza so I can at least enjoy eating one of meal (I don't know how will you send it but I'm from Santiago City, Philippines.)
1	I just got back from my first job interview after 6 months of nothing. Feel like celebrating, but ramen and eggs don't make for the best celebratory food. If anyone's feeling generous I would really enjoy a pizza tonight, and of course would pay it forward once I get this job.    edit: thanks to ftothec!
0	I will be at the WOW hall booth at the U of O Street Faire from 3:30 PM to 5:00. If you could just give the pizza company your number, I don't have a phone. My name is Andrew aka Rev. Andy, and you can hear me on OPB here: http://www.opb.org/thinkoutloud/shows/ross-brothers/ If possible a Meat Lover's deep dish with garlic and artichokes would be awesome, otherwise anything is cool! I won't be able to check back in after I get offline in a bit here, but please let me know if anyone can help!
0	No sob story here, Just want to celebrate my birthday. I'm all alone and don't feel like cooking just for myself. :)
0	Hey, recently found out my mom has breast cancer and have been having to help family out with paying for that, which has really depleted my funds. To make things worse, I just found out that I am being laid off at the end of the week. Would really appreciate pizza if someone will oblige.
1	My partner and I will have been together (in person) 7 years tomorrow (April 16).  We meet online while I was teaching in Korea. When I finished my contract, I went home (NZ) for a month before I flew to Sweden to meet him in real life. Prior to that we'd Skype 6-7 hours a day, email and send letters  Life has been really hard. I haven't been able to go back to NZ, we had to go through his family company (no fault of their own) going through bankruptcy, moving country and visa issues.  We left our jobs at the end of January and moved out of London in the hopes that we could find a place to settle down and have kids.  We lived in at our jobs and worked together in a very stressful situations that really began to affect our relationship and health. Another reason we needed to move.  We've found it really hard to find jobs since though we've applied for everything and anything, pub jobs, cleaning jobs anything.  Tomorrow is our 7 year anniversary and we can't afford to do anything. Which is ok, we still have each other and we're getting along really well again despite the pressures and stress of both being out of work and worried sick about money.  Anyhow, a pizza tomorrow night would be well-appreciated. And the favour will be paid forward as soon as we're in work again. __________________________________________________________________  Thank you for your response Lolly, or maybe tack is more appropriate.  
0	I lost my job at pizza hut a little while ago, haven't had any luck finding a new job so far, now I'm out of money, hungry, and craving some non pizza hut pizza to spite my former employer! Would be very much appreciated.
0	Out of money until the first of the month.  Used my last £10 to buy loads of noodles for me and my girlfriend!  I've not been this skint since I was 19 years old, and it's really trying.  I live in Sheffield, any offers would be massively appreciated!  Thanks to all you RAOPers :D
0	My brother need's some pizza for his First year of college. First post.  He needs Some food for the next couple of days. I'm new to this so if i make a mistake Don't yell at me  He lives in Las Vegas NV
0	Having issues with my back so having trouble standing for long periods and on vicodin for a slipped disc that is pressing on a nerve... havent had anything to eat and havent been able to make it to the store with my back and all these meds on an empty stomach is starting to not make me feel too well. Would greatly appreciate a pizza, cant afford one myself since I have no money, last of it spent on copays (have my disability hearing in feb). Sorry if my post if a bit random but kinda loppy at the moment.
0	I have to write a paper on Sex and the City. so I've had to watch every episode for a detailed analysis I'm worried after watching it I might have to make some serious lifestyle changes need pizza to fe more manly.  EDIT: I'm in the UK  EDIT: essay finished for anyone who wanted to see my dull exploration of [Sex and the City , Feminism Gender and the Media] (http://jagerbacon.wordpress.com/2012/05/11/sex-and-the-city-essay/)
1	I am a student and I work at my school's IT call center. Pay day was supposed to be today - but everyone's time sheet was not submitted due to a clerical error. I only have .88 cents in my checking account and was really counting on getting paid today so I could go buy groceries. I have some staples in my pantry, but those really need to last for two weeks until next payday. I would really appreciate a pizza to make up for not getting paid today.
0	So my SO and I just had a baby 3 months ago, and have gone through so much in between... Just got a new job and just want some time to celebrate with him and my son... Love to see how generous redditors are, and hope I can return the same kindness :)
0	I've been unemployed for two months (Welder), and my girlfriend has to have back surgery later this week.  Found that out this morning.  Lemme tell you, a free meal would be a wonderful thing today.
1	Just rescued two cats (http://imgur.com/fBpUELb) from our neighborhood and brought them in for vaccinations today. I ended up having to empty my bank account (~$200) for the FVRCP shots, parasite tests, exam fees and IV Fluids for one that was dehydrated. They're home now and finally warming up to me!   I'd love a pizza (and I'm sure they'll be fighting me for it).   Thanks!
0	Just craving some pizza tonight. I'd be happy to repay the favor once the semester starts and financial aid gives us a little boost!
1	I've spent the last three days fixing my car, and in the process had to spend all of my money in parts and it's still not fixed yet :(  I've had nothing but bread (no peanut butter or jelly :() the last two days (it was time to go grocery shopping right before car broke down.) I have tried everything to get borrow money from friends, but being college students they couldn't do much.  If someone could send me a pizza that would be awesome, I'd so appreciate it, it'd last last me three days too! I'll pay it forward Friday!
0	Just moved out right next to Disneyland and I wanted something to eat while I work on unpacking. Heck, might be nice to eat a pizza and watch the fireworks right outside my house!
0	Help me cope with my hangover and lack of funds and transportation for the day.
0	Hey Redditors,  It has been awhile since I've been on here. January has been a really rough month and I'm just having a pretty crap day. Here's how January went for me. Car broke down at the beginning of the month, which means I've been busing until payday on Friday. My Grammy passed away suddenly from complications from lung cancer on January 11th. Being alone in WA meant a very complicated and extended grieving process as I couldn't get down to Oregon until the day before the funeral. Came back up and found that on top of my car being broken down, my tire went flat as it sat there completely still and parked meaning I'll have to get it fixed and replace a tire now. Then yesterday I was on Skype with my boyfriend who is an Airman and already far away in Omaha and he got orders. They're for Japan. And he leaves in April. We had plans for his leave in June. Those won't happen anymore. So today I am just sad and teary and majorly craving pizza. I do promise to hop back on after Payday and pay it forward, I know how much a pizza can brighten a day!
1	Tomorrow is my first final of finals weeks and I'm already feeling more stressed than anyone should be. These are my last finals ever and I want to finish college on a good note. This semester has given me nothing but a headache. Anyone want to help out a stressed student? I'd be eternally grateful and forever in your debt.
1	Of all the forums I've seen on here, this one is the most interesting, most interactive, and the most uplifting.   Need some of that right about now. I think I sprained my ankle because I was scared I was going to be late to work. I was three minutes early. Then I got laid off. My wife has a reliable job, but it's only meant for secondary income. Grocery day is on Friday, but we have to start cutting back and saving as soon as we can. We probably won't have pizza for a while so if anyone can help us and the kids out, it'd be great. I can't promise to pay it back on a certain day, but I will do it as soon as I can.  Off to the fun world of resume writing....  Thank you all for doing what you do and for reading my post!
1	Thanks for getting this far. Not to pile on the bad news, because it really isn't that bad, but I just got a call from the landlord that the power's been out for a few hours in my complex, and to be careful of the food in the fridge when I get back from work. Sounds like it could be a long day. I understand that my posting history isn't too broad, but is  I'm a long time lurker and this account is two months old. Maybe someone can help me out. Thanks and have a good day!  EDIT: I totally meant October 25th, not May 15. That'd be silly.
1	I prefer saucy to cheesy.
1	I'm a 21 year old Boston college student and my bank account is overdrawn until Monday. I've been living on ramen noodles and some old brownies I made last week. A pizza would really help get me through the weekend!   I can pay it forward (or back! if you prefer) on Monday when I get my check!  Thanks in advance to whoever can help! 
0	Well, me and my girlfriend are celebrating our two years and I don't have any money whatsoever to pay for anything for her. I work at burger king but my paycheck goes straight to my savings account, for my little baby girl on the way. I would really appreciate if someone could send me a pizza, I know I'm new on here, but I found this site from wishuponahero. I recieved some clothes from there, but haven't asked for something of this sort. I just need this help just once.
0	I'm exhausted. Would love to treat my little ones to a pizza dinner, but am cash poor at the moment. Never asked before, but, did win a contest like a year ago. Would love some pizza hut if anyone is feeling generous. (no one else delivers to me) Will pay it forward in the near future. :) Thanks to all the generous pizza givers here! 
0	Hey guys, I'm a college student in Richmond and it's a couple days before I move into my new place. I'm trying to save up money so I can be independent from my parents, who haven't really offered support unless they can use it to their advantage... Anyway, a pizza my way would be much appreciated, and once I start my full time job I'll try to pay it forward.  Thanks!
0	Wife &amp; I are splitting up for good, she has gone for the weekend to spend time with some of her family for a bit.  Using a throwaway because we haven't notified most of our friends &amp; family yet of our situation, and I know a few people know my primary reedit account.  It's an amicable split, but that doesn't make it instantly easy, either.  That all being said, it's not only rough emotionally, but selling a house is rough (especially with the nature of the economy and us not being at a point where we were expecting to sell).  I could probably spare the $10 for a small or medium pizza, but I'm *really* trying to save every penny to help with all the costs.  Plus, right now, a lot of things just feel like it sucks.  A little more right now since I'm in this house by myself.  If anyone thinks I'm a troll/scammer, I'd be happy to give you the name of my primary reddit name in private and verify through there and/or through the verification system.  FYI, I'm in the U.S., if that matters to anyone.  Thanks, guys and gals.
0	Hey there you guys! I'm a college freshman, and I'm in serious want of some fresh pizza. I don't have much spending cash, and I would really appreciate it if someone could lend me a hand. **** EDIT: I'm in Ohio, about a half an hour out of Cleveland. I go to a tiny college, in a tiny town. I'm studying political science!  
0	Just trying to make it to payday on Thursday getting by on toast but the bread's almost gone.
0	It's a bit cold and windy here in Montana. I'm cramping something terrible (my Midol and a heating pad are barely saving me) and I'm lonely. A pizza for a crappy night would be much appreciated :)
0	I have less than 2 dollars in each of my accounts right now.  The government of Kentucky takes out more money from me during the summer from my small stipend because I am not taking classes.  I still have to do my research/work.  I do not want to ask my parents for money as I'm 25 and I hate doing that.  I just saved some money on my car insurance but that doesn't come into effect until next month.  I'm barely getting by and have had about a coffee and a granola bar today.  Please someone save me!
0	Been driving solo from Florida to LA since May 15th, camping in forests and national parks and crashing on people's couches when I can. Mostly eating canned food and boxed stuff like cereal and granola bars. I'm in Phoenix right now and would really love a piping hot pizza.
0	Long story short my husband and I both worked at the same company driving medical supplies to and from hospitals. We were required to use our own vehicles because the company only had so many (that were breaking down anyway).  The transmission went in my husbands car and our boss told him that he refuses to pay for the gas to run the stuff in a van instead of his car that he can't afford to get fixed and fired him.  We were in a tight spot in the first place because we're constantly spending our money on fixing the cars (that we still owe $10k on) + necessities. We have an infant, 9yr old, 11yr old and a pet dog. Ever since he lost his job we've been eating nothing but cheap things (hamburger helper, ramen, hot dogs) for at least a month.  We were accepted for food stamps but with my income they only give us $150 per month which lasts us a week with the amount of food my boys consume. My husband has had interview after interview with no luck whatsoever. I think they'd be really happy to come home from the pool tonight and have a great feast of pizza.   Tldr; We're broke and sick of the same dinner table scenery and would really like a couple pizzas tonight.  We were taken care of! Thanks so much to MamaGrr!
0	Hey, I dont really want to cry with a sob story but I'm really hungry and i cant afford anything! A pizza would be a welcome treat for me and my dog!   Thanks :)
0	We are just 8 lovely ladies sitting in a small kitchen around an over while our talented friend cuts our hair. We have laughs and love, all we need now is pizza!
0	I'm not sure how I would get a pizza. :( I live near McConnellsburg, Pa. and we have a few local places, but nobody that delivers. I could go pick it up, but I'm not sure how that would work.  It's the day before payday and I'd really like something other than bean and bacon soup for dinner.  I've given in the past and I'll give again this week if I can get some yummies tonight! :)
0	My friend tore her leg muscles and cant really walk that much at the moment she doesnt have much to eat at her gmas and would really love a pizza I told her i might be able to get her one please and thank you from her and I. Also in Illinois I missed that in the title first post here sorry
0	I've had ramen 3 times a day for the past 5 days straight, and often more these past few months. Lost my job because my Fiance had a nervous breakdown over her brother dying and I had to take time off to take care of her, and it just got worse and worse and I got fired. Like for coming in tired from dealing with her, etc. Just requesting a pizza for change of pace. Thanks.
1	I was living with a friend until yesteday when i had to pack up my stuff and move out. Currently i dont have really anywhere to stay and very little food i just need a little something to last till the third when my food stamps come in. Any help is appreciated god bless
0	So my truck was stollen from my car port last night :(. An 88 Toyota Pickup. Why anyone would want it is a mystery to me. Probably just stoll it for parts and tires. Anyhoo, it's shitty and I think a nice pizza would cheer me up and make the research I need to do to find a new (new to me :)) vehicle a little easier to deal with. 
1	After spending 18 hours in a lot of pain and devoid of any appetite, the pain has either taken a break or I am stone free. Either way I am exhausted and (finally!) starving. Not really wanting to move around much for fear of jinxing the peace my ureter has found and pizza sounds delicious. Anyone want to help a girl out? Your act would never be forgotten by me and always appreciated.
0	Here I am at work. With my coworker. Were here until 9:30 and realize neither of us has our wallets.. Wed love a pizza. And he already said to me he'd go halfsies on repaying the favor next time we work together, for someone else on here! Were in NH right now and will be here until 9:30 eastern time. So if someone wants to feed us it'd be lovely :]
1	Hey all lost my job a little over 8 months ago, finally got a new one that I start the 4th of next month. My bank account is negative, and the only way I have survived is food stamps, which I get again this Friday. Anyone want to send me a Papa John's pizza (only chain that will deliver here) In STL City, you will help me eat until I get food on Friday!
0	It's 10/30, posted this up yesterday, seems I'm pretty popular on here. Have not got any help yet and would still like a pizza if anyone willing to spare me some.  I'm not exactly a charity case (at least not yet) but I was planning on using that $50 for food, now it's going to a stinking overdraft fee instead. I work part time at a local church doing clean ups every Tuesday and Friday. It's not my main job but it helps out a whole lot. The problem is they pay me with these checks that are uncashable, they have to be deposited into an account. I have an ebanking account with Bank of America, every time I deposit a check I get charged a service fee at the end of the month. Well, guess what hit my bank last night? A couple service fees and an overdraft fee for good measure, just wonderful. So my account went from a positive few cents yesterday to negative $56 dollars today. Even when I put in my check I'll be overdrawn anyway, and if I can't come up with the difference they'll hit me for another $35 in a couple days.  They told me that overdraft protection would stop this kind of thing, but of coarse it doesn't do a thing against their fees so getting them removed isn't happening. I'm just glad I filled up my car the other night or I wouldn't have wheels next week. I get paid next Friday and thankfully my Mom is gonna send me some money in a couple days but I'm empty stomached between now and then. Would anybody mind tossing a pizza and some soda my way to tide me over? You'd earn a spot in my prayers tomorrow for sure. I'm just tired of life dumping on me, so if anyone would cut me a break I'd love you forever.
0	About a week left before finals, gonna be up all night editing a paper for tomorrow morning and going into the kitchen just makes me sad. I get my school money in April and I promise to pay pizza forward as soon as I can. 
1	I'm currently 25 weeks pregnant, and between checks.  I've eaten dry Kix today, and nothing else.  I could really use some actual food.  Any help would be great.  We have a Papa Johns, Dominoes, and Pizza Hut in town.  Thank you so much!
1	My daughter just recently started kindergarten, and after lots of worrying she seems to be doing really well. (She's a trooper!) I promised her a special dinner this week and she'd specifically requested pizza, but I had some unexpected bills and now pizza isn't really an option.  It would really make her week and mine if someone would throw us a pie (and possibly some breadsticks--she loves dipping!)  Thanks for reading! 
0	i donate plasma weekly all tapped out for this week so when i donate next week ill pay it forward on here located in phoenix btw
0	Basically what the title says, I had a back spasm this morning and after seeing my trainer and having a little stim therapy I have barely left bed all day. Go ahead and give to that guy who lost his job first I'm sure he needs it more than I do but if you have pizza to spare I would truly appreciate it.
0	So this is my first time requesting anything. I'm sorry if I don't understanding the formatting or the information I put.  After being away from my GF for nearly a month, I was finally able to come down and see her this weekend... but only for 2 days. It usually costs me a lot of money just for the trip so and I can't afford to spend money I don't have.  I am a big fan of paying it forward and promise to make an offer when I am able to. Thank you :)
1	Titles says it! A couple more weeks of school until graduation as a math major. Really hungry for both a paying-job or a pizza, let me know if you can help!
0	this month was rough with a highe than planned electric bill and been paying for 20lb propane to heat our house while we wait for wood and so we had tuna and crackers for brunch...   needless to say with the girlfriend's sister over tonight we could use a real meal but one we don't have to scrap together, something with ease might do us well. and hopefully we bounce back quick when the money rolls in.   new to the subreddit, thanks for any help. peace :)
0	I'm having a one of those bad days. Spent all my money on rent and just had chicken broth for breakfast. A pizza would surely lift a down mans spirit. In return I'll hook you up with a discount at any Marriott!
1	I wouldn't normally be asking random people for help because I dont like asking for things but im in a tough spot right now. I was an explosive specialist from 2002-2006 (2006-2008 Inactive Reserves) I now work in security (im at work now) I dont make alot of money even with a college degree, I dont get paid until friday I have no lunch and no dinner (well I have 3 boxes of mac n cheese at home) I litterally have 3 boxes of mac n cheese 1 package of hot dogs and 3 cans of sphagetti o's to last until friday...so if anyone could help and get me something to eat and maybe take home to my wife and two kids I would greatly appreiciate it. I have proof of serive if you want it.
0	Hey guys. I'm at work and hungry as hell. After work i have to head over to a gig doing video work for them. I'd love to get me a bite to eat but I don't have any money til friday. Be a friend? :D
0	I have no more money after paying the bills and I have little food in my house. Please help! Thanks. :)
1	Stressing out about my 5 years olds testings tomorrow at the St Paul Childrens Hospital. Not in the mood to cook but must feed the boys somehow. Would love the help of getting dominos or pizza hut for dinner.  Thanks in advance. ~Kacey, Del, JC and Caden~
0	We're quickly running out of food money as we are preparing to move to a different state.  My wife is 6 1/2 months pregnant and usually craves mexican food but tonight she itching for some pizza. Grants Pass,  Oregon USA
0	No big sob story.  Actually kept going back and forth to even post this.  Long story short, broke till payday, need some lunch.  Once I decided I will definitely pay it forward when I get paid, I figured what could it hurt.  Also seems to be a really fun concept to be a part of.    In closing, thanks.  As stated, I will be back at the end of the week to pay it forward to others.   
1	hey again, tonight i'm super hungry! this week i've been living off of 12$ buying ramen and eating it twice a day, and frankly i feel kind of malnourished. I've got to make it until sunday, and it would really help to have a pie! :) !
0	There is really no huge story, I got pulled over last week and got a ticket ...so i'm  shortttt on cash. I'll be here Friday night to buy the next guy pizza!!!
0	Until my student loan comes through on monday/tuesday (I've been assured) I basically have nothing to eat. Friends have been cooking me dinner every night this week, but I thought maybe reddit might buy me lunch today. I've never done this before, not exactly sure how it works.
0	I didn't know there was a place on the internet where you could even make a request like this. Reddit is truly amazing and the people here are so nice. I find myself getting lost in threads, especially about memes, iama, and askreddit. I have to admit, I browse more than I make actual responses because I usually don't have the time to sit down and type out a response.             So today I find myself with nothing important to do. I slept in, cleaned up the place, went for a walk and came back with nothing to do. Even the programs on tv aren't that entertaining. I have a choice between Keeping up with the Kardashians and Pregnant and Dating. No thank you. I think I'll keep the tv off for now.           I would greatly appreciate something random and delicious, since my Saturday has been pretty ho hum so far.  Nothing fancy, but I would totally dig a cheese pizza. I would be so grateful if someone would be willing to treat me to some pizza tonight. Thank you. 
0	Nothing super depressing, just poor timing. My car broke down two days ago, and I had to use my grocery money to fix it. I've been living on the pasta I had left, but I cooked the last of it earlier for lunch. I get paid tomorrow and would be more than willing to send pizza back to someone in thanks, but it might be nice to have a bit of dinner tonight if possible. I have a verification code ready and waiting as well, if that helps. If someone should be so generous, I don't need anything fancy. It's just me here. A one topping large from Pizza Hut (are they still doing the large one toppings for 10 bucks?) would be perfect since PH is pretty close.
1	I'm losing my room tomorrow or the next day, so this is the last time I have my girls until I can find a new house to live in. Being the last night I will see them for a while, I just don't want them to remember their last dinner here as a bowl of ramen. Thanks!
0	We have three kids, two with autism, and one of them has been throwing a violent tantrum since about 8pm. Our townhouse is very small, and the other two kids can't be in their beds right now for safety reasons, so they're "going to sleep" in the rec room. Obviously they're still awake. I don't get paid until Thursday, and we could really use a pizza to make this less awful on the family.
0	Hi everyone,   I'm completely out of cash and won't be paid until Monday from work. I'm currently studying neuroscience and hope to help the world one day. Would definitely appreciate some help from the world tonight.  Note: I don't have a paypal, but dominos/papa john's e-gift cards work great.
0	We have been living off left over turkey stuffing and rationing cutting up hot dogs into it while sick for the past few days. We are broke until the end of the month and could really use anything. A 12$ large pepperoni would be ideal since its cheap for you and enough food to to last us tonight and even breakfast tomorrow.  Thanks to anyone who even takes the time to look at this.
0	It's been a long day of work, fairly stressed out, and I've lost faith in humanity. Can it be restored?
0	Ugh, so woke up 2 days ago to my 9 year old puking with a fever turned out she ha a UTI. Much fun as last time she had one we ended up in hospital as she was hallucinating through the fever. We've broken through the fever and shes on the mend again now so good to see her smile shes requesting all her favourite foods as shes obviously not eaten properly all weekend and I'd love to supply her with a pizza. 
0	Hi all, I am new and am trying to get some food for me and my wife and 2 kids. I got this site from a friend that said I could get help here at least for tomorrow.  Can I please get some pizza for us. My wife doesn't get a pay check til Thursday. 
0	Hi everyone.  I'm currently between jobs and looking to give my girlfriend a little treat on her birthday, a day we both don't have the means to properly celebrate right now.  We've still got food in the pantry so we aren't going hungry, but I'd like to switch it up a little bit with some cheesy comfort food.  Any kind souls out there today?
0	So, yeah, as the title reads, I've had one hell of a week.  I had a job as a clerical assistant in the East Hartford area for about 2 months, essentially doing scrub work, and thought everything was going well, until out of the blue on Tuesday, they fired me without a real reason.  I've since been on a few job interviews, but this economy is killing everything up here, and I'm getting scared.  As a cherry on top of my already wonderful week, my girlfriend of 2 1/2 years left me, saying we've been moving in separate directions for some time now.  I think this is code for she's been fucking everyone in town behind my back, but who knows.  So Reddit, I come to you on my knees, looking for a little help.  I know how sad and pathetic it sounds, but a pizza would help erase the memory of this week, but I just don't have the means to go out and buy one now, since I'm unemployed, paying both sides of my rent, utilities and misc. expenses. 
0	 I've been unemployed for a year and 2 months. Due to being unemployd, I've been living with my fiance's parents. It's been a long, hard road what with money issues and studying for my degree, but I was finally offered a part time job which is set to start on Feb. 28th.    I'd love to get a pizza to celebrate the good news and the start of a new chapter with the people who've graciously opened their home to me and helped me out this long.    As soon as I get my first paycheck, I'm buying a fellow reddior some pizza!         I'm located in PR.   Thanks for existing RAoP, you guys are amazing, I love seeing how generous people can be.
0	DnD group is getting rather hungry from adventuring, would really appreciate some pizza!  Can prove with pictures if need be.
0	We are a family of 3 who would enjoy a pizza tonite.We live in Houston were its 100 degres today!We have a sm. apt. with one A.C. unit. We keep the kitchin and bedroom blocked off to keep at least one room cool.I do have afew packs of meat but it just so unbarable to cook. My son always asks why iam dripping with sweat.It would be great to enjoy a meal togeather without me having to go take a shower frist and eating by myself.I just saw PAY IT BACK afew weeks ago and just loved the concept! CANT WAIT TILL I CAN PAY IT BACK! Thanks to all that support this ideia!!! 
1	Long story short, I'm unemployed and joining the army. Unfortunatly it's taking WAY longer than anticipated and in the meantime I have been unable to find any work.   My girlfriend puts up with me and she's currently out now with her little part time retail job which she has to keep us scraping.   I'd like to surprise her for when she comes in from work at 4pm with pizza (we haven't had any for a long time - training fitness etc etc)    Since you got this far - Thanks for listening :)
0	no emergency just testing raop
0	The summer is an incredibly slow season due to residing in a student saturated city (when school is out, so is the population). Bills among other strokes of terrible luck have left me with less than $1 in my pocket and one box of mac n' cheese without any milk to make it. All I want is to be able to eat some dinner tonight. Help a fellow Redditor out?
0	So, I am 20 years old and for the past two months due to a fight with me and mom, (she didn't wanna fill out my fasfa form so i can get a grant for college), I have been homeless. I don't drive, and I didn't have a job for a while I just recently started working part time at a buffet I don't get paid for another two weeks. I make it day by day with help from my friends, I don't know where I am going to sleep every night, or how I am going to eat. And most of the time I will go without food, But a friend of mine told me about random acts of pizza and how they help people in situations like mine. So, it would help me a lot if someone can help me eat for the week. I don't like asking for things, and I feel dumb because I am asking for food. But its to the point where I don't have very many options. Thanks, &lt;3 Mercedes.
0	One of those pay the bills or eat situations until I start my new job next week and get paid in three weeks. :(
0	No sob story or anything like that I'm just a dude with no cash and food for the day and would really appreciate someone giving him a pizza.
0	I would love to eat some pizza sometime this week, I realize that no pizza place will probably be open today but I can go for it tomorrow if necessary. I will definitely pay the act forward if someone is generous enough.
0	Just a Hungry student :)
0	id really like to have a nice pizza dinner with my family. its been a long time. we had our house destroyed by the hurricane Irene. its still standing but not livable and were told we have to rebuild it. me, my husband and our four kids are staying with my sister. its really hard cuz we were struggling before (i was laid off a few mo ago) and now its just scary sometimes. im going to career centers and applying for jobs, but there just arent any. my husband takes OT when its available. our church is helping us but there are others who need much more and i dont want to take away from them.  we have food on the table. its usually not much more than boiled chicken and instant potatos but were managing. a pizza dinner would be an incredible treat. even my teen and pre-teen would sit down with us if there was pizza! if anyone can help, id be so happy.  thank you
0	I didn't know a place like this exists!   I was out sick for 3 days the week before Labour Day. After my manager came back, I was let go at the end of my shift. I was supposed to be paid my last pay(big whopping 7.5 hours of pay) on Friday that just passed, and of course, they didn't pay me and said that'd be another week before I'll get my final check from them. I start at a new job tomorrow but won't be paid until October 4th and that money all goes right into rent.   I just would love to eat pizza and watch Breaking Bad tonight as if everything was normal. 
1	Howdy RAOP! I've been in a giant funk lately that I've been unable to pull myself out of, then then tonight my son surprised me. He wrote me a little note saying that I should play Xbox with him and take my "mind off of things," along with other sweet things.   We played for about 2 hours while he asked me questions about when I was in 3rd grade and joked around about Space Chimps. It was the funnest time I've had in a long time and really reminded me about what's important.   I don't have access to my account until Monday night since the fiance has my card on a trip for a class for work. I have stuff for the weekend but it's all meals that my son doesn't really enjoy that much. Since neither of us will go hungry this weekend I will completely understand if you would rather give to someone who needs it more than myself, but I would love to treat my "punkin" for everything he did for me tomorrow sometime. Taking a pizza to the park is one of his favorite things.  I will be making offers next week, whether or not I get a pizza so even if you're just reading this and you're hungry be sure to check back with me then. :)   I think it's time for a great nights sleep now but I will check back tomorrow!
0	Yo guys, i'm hosting a LAN-party right now and i think everyone would appreciate a little pizza, so we can stay up all night and such, so yeah.   If we get enough requests we'll send pics of our sweaty, sweet party. We're only 3 persons though!  We're in sweden, so if you wanna send some food/pizza you can use this site: http://mat24.se/postnummer/62143  Thanks in advance bros! &lt;3
1	I'm basically really hungry and this would really make my night :3   Also, the flu sucks...&gt;&lt;
0	I'm cat-sitting these little Satan spawn kittens (they're really adorable) and I'm super hungry. A pizza would be very much appreciated!  Will provide photo proof of kittens if requested.  Will also pay it forward when I'm able!  edit: If anyone sees this, I'm still looking for pizza :]
1	Not needy, I just looove me some pizza. 19/F weighing in at a whopping 90 pounds and I have to gain *at least* 6 pounds before I leave for basic training (Air Force) on December 13th. Of course I'll gain the weight no matter what, but pizza certainly wouldn't hurt.  [Here is a picture](http://i.imgur.com/EJXAG.png) of my dog as a puppy to further entice you. Beaver's the name.
0	Just started working yesterday and I'm tireeeeeeeeed. It'd be cool to kick back with my friend and eat some pizza. I don't have a sob story, sorry.  Thanks! :)
0	Anyone?  Will not return favor
0	So... this is finals week, and I figured a responsible way of bracing myself for exams would be......catching up on Futurama/Adventure Time/Fullmetal Alchemist episodes while EATING PIZZA !! Isn't it an awesome idea ?  Also my battleplan involves a blanket and tea, and extreme denial of the imminence of exams ;)   The only erm, slight problem I encountered in my GENIUS project. Is that I'm kinda broke, and fishfingers and cereals only last you so long before you are too broke to have pizza but too proud/ashamed to beg your family to send you enough to last the month :/ Anyone ever experienced this ?  So if anyone feels like sending a bit of cheesy food to Dublin, Ireland, it would really brighten up the whole *week* :D of a broke but happy female Economics and Politics college student. (not sure if there's a rule to specify stuff about myself to prove I'm real but, yeah, here ou go haha)  If infos are needed or something to prove I'm real PM me please, also I'm not sure how to give my adress or...(?) (sorry about the awkwardness, it's my first time creating a topic instead of just commenting. Stomach made me do it)  PS: Sorry for any second-language slips or grammatical atrocities. English isn't my native language. (France yaaay)   
0	Over the past two weeks I've been having a bad luck streak ( got in car accident, had to go to the hospital twice, etc ) which has taken a lot out of my already very light wallet. Haven't really hung out with my love since all the bad luck began and would like a pizza to keep our tummy's full while we hang out tonight. Anything that can help us out tonight would be very much appreciated.
0	So I've never posted in RAOP before but a friend suggested I come here. Yesterday a pair of pits attacked me and my dog while walking around my neighborhood and I just paid off the vet and hospital bills this morning. It really has left me with $6.88 and means I have no money to eat for a week. I'm going to try and find a way to get food for the meantime (food pantry perhaps?) but after the stress a pizza would be amazing.  If you are willing to help me make it through this week with offers of pizza until I get paid, every single pizza will be paid forward after pay day.  This is Indiana:  * http://imgur.com/IP70c * http://imgur.com/xIAiv * http://imgur.com/smJNf * http://imgur.com/x5dmS * http://imgur.com/rgmFX  Photos of bill available if that kind of thing is needed. I have a verification code to give as well. This is my first time ever here so, apologizes if I've broken a rule I didn't see.  ***P.S. To any one out there considering getting an pitbull terrier THIS SHOULD IN NO WAY AFFECT YOUR DECISION.*** Indiana is part pit and pits are absolutely lovely creatures. The owner trained them for defense and fighting then let them get loose. I am already broken up about them getting destroyed. Responsible and loving dog owners know that pits are wonderful.
0	My grandmother passed away 2 years ago. I grew up a block away so I played at her house often growing up. When the opportunity came to buy her 96 olds, it was like a little piece of her was back with me. That was until today. I was at work during a blizzard, and was relieved when the store closed early. Driving home on a main highway, a truck backed out while he was plowing a parking lot. I couldn't stop. I wasn't injured except from a cut from the airbag and a bump on the knee. Here's my proof. http://i.imgur.com/0LbolU1.jpg. I hate asking, but could some one help me out? I could care less about the car, accidents happen. But the fact that it was my grandmas...that crushed me.
0	Currently studying for my second final and haven't been eating well (mainly just once a day) Most of the time it's maruchan ramen, sometimes those $1 banquet meals if I feel like i deserve it...My Bank of America account has literally 2.67 left! D:  I would be eternally thankful to the stranger that buys me a nice hot pie of pizza! In the future I promise to return the favor!  Also if you need any sort of validation I'm be more than happy to give it to you (to the best of my ability)
1	hi guys, earlier this week i tore or otherwise really messed up a tendon in my shoulder while at work. i just spent the last of my cash putting gas in my roommate's car so he can get to work. i'm down to chocolate milk, dry rice and canned peas until i get paid tomorrow (thursday) night and i'm in too much pain to even use my dominant hand to type, let alone use pots and pans and try to cook something that doesnt even seem worth eating to begin with. and of course a pay it forward or a thank you pizza for the donator will be the least i can do, guaranteed by end of day saturday.  i appreciate your time, this took me a long time to type with only my non-dominant hand &gt;.&lt;
1	Hey there Reddit. Things haven't been going right for the next few days. My [roommate and best friend](http://imgur.com/ALJUP) started having suicidal thoughts a few days ago, and ended up checking herself into the ER for observation. I've just paid off rent, two weeks late, and have no money until Thursday. And my younger sister came over today because she keeps getting sick at her apartment, which means there's two mouths to feed and not much food to go around.  I'm lonely, sad, and worn down and I'm hoping that some pizza and silly tv shows might turn that around. Thing is, there's no pizza currently. If anyone is willing to donate some I would be insanely grateful.   Thanks in advance.
0	Hey you guys, I just got accepted to Syracuse University and just moved in, however I realized that I'm absolutely broke and I won't have a roommate until next week. I'm starting a job on Monday, September 3rd and would appreciate it so much if someone can hold me over until then or as much as possible.  EDIT: Just took a picture with timestamp of my acceptance letter. Can PM if needed.
0	~~I have managed to pay off tuition with 17$ left in my checking account and 200$ worth of credit card debt. I have been eating ramen noodles for the past week and would love some sort of meat on a pizza. Also lost my job and trying to find another so i need the money I have left for gas.. Help me RAOP, you're my only hope~~  Thanks to Stalked_Like_Corn, he is freaking awesome.
1	Not like dying sick, just don't-feel-like-moving sick. Soup &amp; noodles just isn't cutting it, but pizza isn't exactly in my budget right now.  I'd love to just have something tasty to eat on for a few days while I recover.  I live in Pinebluff, NC &amp; the only place that delivers is Pizza Hut, so an eGift for there would be amazing. Thanks!  **EDIT: I have been taken care of by the very gracious mr_jeep. Thank you again! :3**
1	'Sright. In exchange for sending me pizza, I will do my damnedest to draw your likeness on my own body. With a sharpie.  No, I'm not out of cash, I'm not grieving a loss, and I'm certainly not craving vegetables (you thought those jokes were over, didn't you?). Just looking to be part of something entertaining.  Notes: I'm NOT an art student. I'm not even very good at drawing. But I'm still going to do everything in my power to draw my very best for you. Also: you could request your favorite animal if you don't like the idea of your face drawn on some stranger somewhere.  Please also note where you'd like me to draw. Before you do, however, contort yourself and see if you could accurately draw on that part of yourself. If you can't: I can't.  Let's have some Sunday fun, shall we?
0	Hey everybody,  My band and I are from Chicago, and we are in week two of our 5 week tour. The 6 of us have nowhere to stay tonight in southern Oregon so we pooled our money to get a hotel room. Since we have no show today we don't have a venue to provide us food, so a hot meal would be much appreciated. In return, we have merch to offer you or we could send you the digital download of our debut album.   We would be more than grateful for any help, our moms are worried we aren't getting enough to eat. Seriously. 
0	I do not have a sad story that I'd wish to share, as I feel that life is full of ups and downs. Because this is one of (if not) the busiest time of the year for retail, I've been working 9 and 10 hour days for about two weeks. I go to school at night and get just enough sleep to wash and repeat. I'm working on obtaining my degree in Business, and I hope that I'll be able to open my own shop someday. I have alot of big ideas I'd like to see play out in the long term business wise, but for now I feel pretty exhausted XD. No real need here, I make enough to get by but after a day of cyber Monday customers I don't have it in me to cook dinner. A ham and pineapple pizza would make my night. I hope someone can help me out, but if not thank you and hope you got in some of the cyber Monday deals.
0	guys, I have been living off of pbj for 2 days, due to a problem with the direct deposit money transfer that has left 2 dollars in my bank account as they sort it out.. I couldn't help but notice the influx of Papa John's coupons, but only have a dominos close to me :( can some kind redditor please help me out? I can make a promise to pay it forward and return the favor once the money situation is settled. Thank you for your kindness.
0	I am moving soon, so I'm trying to not go to the grocery store and stock up my cabinets so that less food is wasted.  I'd be extremely grateful for a GOOD pizza, and would love to share it with my friends. Thanks guys =]

0	My boyfriend and I would love a warm pie for lunch/dinner but unfortunately are lacking the funds :( PM me for info, any help is appreciated!
0	My husband got laid off on Wednesday. We have leftovers for tonight but would really appreciate some pizza this weekend. I'm breastfeeding so I need lots of carbs!
0	My SO is 32, has multiple sclerosis and is on disability. He went out of state to get a controversial surgery that's suppose to help his symptoms. It was paid all out of pocket by him and his parents. He's going to be home in a couple hours and I'd love to surprise him with pizza since he has been through so much stress these past few days. (And we are broke until the 1st) I can at the very least prove the MS/on disability parts if you would like. This would mean so much! Thanks in advance!  *Edit for spelling.
1	Lost my job Monday. Sucks. I think a delicious pizza would be great... but I can't afford one... If someone could please buy me, even a cheap large cheese would be better than the growling stomach I have now. Thanks. 
1	I didn't know being pregnant would be so exhausting, and I really don't feel like cooking today. Also, we've been on a budget and have only had rice and chicken for the past week, pizza would be a nice change!  Thanks for reading!!
1	Proof - http://imgur.com/a/ra8GW  My father just recently got his 3 year sobriety coin, i planned on celebrating today but there was a problem at my work and now i wont be paid until monday, if there is someone out there kind enough to help us id be indescribably grateful.
0	hi, so i'm new at this, i was told by a friend that this site could help me, basically i'm a student in england, living with 3 other guys (well was suppose to be) we made the down payments all the pre-payed bills and what not then 1 guy pulls out this has made me and my friend very skint, as we're picking up his third of the payments and now i've heard my "friend" is thinking of pulling a fast one on me trying to get out of this contract as well! - so, here i am, a poor, frustrated student who has lost trust in his friends and is struggling to put food on the table, anyone going to help a brother out?   i'm not begging, i'm new at this, reading some of the stuff on this page has given me some hope that their are more humans with hearts on this planet then i think.
1	domino's is fine, really anything. just super hungry!! pretty please, and thank you so much. umass amherst, by the way. USA. Massachusetts. 
1	I'm poor geeky college girl. I don't currently have a job, my bank account is over drafted and I have three weeks until my next disbursement comes. If someone would be so kind as to spot me a pizza tonight I will buy that person two pizzas when my money comes in.  RECIEVED  Thanks to ashleythegreat!!!
1	Edit: I'm sorry, I forgot to say I live in Minnesota, USA.  Hey everyone, I'd really enjoy a full stomach tonight, my future is looking extremely down, but I have the next four days to enjoy, I'll share my story, it's a little lengthy, but you certainly deserve to know why I'm asking for a meal tonight.  The sparknotes version is that my Dad passed away when I was young, too young to really remember anything about him other then he loved Star Trek. After that, my Mom remarried a man, who was very abusive. We lived on for about a year and then my Mom passed away. Both of my parents had cancer, I don't know if I do or not, I'm not 100% sure on how the genetics work with something like that.  Anyways, I lived with him for about two years until I moved in with a family from a church. They were in their mid 50's, not at all a good age to raise a 12 year old apparently. They were beyond abrasive to me and just wasn't a good fit, but I had no choice. After about three years I moved up north with a family for about four months when they decided they were too young and busy for me. They were in their late twenties and they had just had two kids, again, not a good fit. I was kicked out on a moments notice had my aunt pick me up and drive me back to the cities. My aunt then proceeded to drop me off at her apartment and tell me that no one in my family is willing to take me in. I waited on the curb with all of my stuff, calling friends, until one of their families wanted to take me in. I lived with them for about two years until they decided they needed to move to Iowa, they offered to take me with, but I declined because a friend in school wanted me to graduate with him. I lived there until I graduated.  About a week after I graduated, they had a death in the family and needed to use my room for company. I could certainly understand, so I moved into a place where a guy owns a house and just rents out rooms, found on craigslist. Being seventeen, I didn't have much of an option because most apartment buildings wouldn't allow me to move in being underage.  I started working at a game store that I loved right near by where I lived, it was a place where I would put in like 40-60 hours a week, sometimes paid for overtime, most of the time not. I loved that store, but a year after I started, the store had to close down due to investor issues. I had about a week's notice and the closing day was the day before Christmas Eve. I was unemployed for a few months until I started working at another game store, but they lasted about four months after I started working there.   Currently, I'm working at a Car Wash while trying to get into something with gaming. I'm not aiming to make it though, I'm in debt to my landlords and I don't make nearly enough money to pay it back currently. I was a bright student, but I've had no opportunity to go to college or anything, I don't have the safety net of a family.  My phone is going to be turned off any minute, I owe Redbox money for a rental that I can't repay (Another stupidly long story), and I owe my landlord $525.00 on Sunday, and I currently have about $4 to my name. I have no where to turn for help, I'm just trying to enjoy the days I have left.  If someone would be willing to make tonight a great night by buying me a meal, I'd be forever grateful.   Thanks for reading, any words of encouragement would be appreciated too.
0	My girlfriend and I have been living on to ramen for about a week and a half and would really love any kind of pizza super hungry!!!!!!we used a majority of out food stamps for baby food this month and a Pizza would make us so happy Thanks for reading!
1	My fellow redditors, this week has probably taken the cake (or pizza? please say pizza) for worst week of my life. Two weeks ago my SO and I went to visit our respective parents in our hometown. SO had just gotten his Masters and we were there to celebrate. SO grandmother has a heart attack the day after we arrive and is in the hospital the whole time we're there. She died 3 separate times and was revived. All planned celebrations are (rightfully) ceased. Return home a week and some later after grandma is stable to find that our power bill is in arrears thanks to a shitty roommate we had and they are threatening to shut off our power. They refuse to work out any kind of payment plan and more or less tell us 'all or nothing' by 6pm tomorrow or we're out of luck. Next, find out the oven mysteriously broke while we were away and can no longer cook anything decent. Found this out after I attempted to cook a frozen pizza and was horrified by the half cooked doughy mess slithering through the oven rack. Don't know where I'm getting the money for the power bill and probably going to have to pick up stakes and move back home... but please reddit, if I can use anything right now it's a random act of pizza.   **TLDR: SO and I returned from visiting sick family member to discover our power is going to be turned off tomorrow; oven died and mangled a frozen pizza we were going to have for supper.**
0	tomorrow, my wife and i are going before a judge to let him decide if our bankrupcy case is valid. we've had a really tough time of things through this, but tomorrow is the light at the end of the tunnel.  we would love to have a pizza dinner just to ourselves to get our spirits up and ready for the fight we'll have tomorrow.  thanks to all who read this.
1	My boyfriend (fellow redditor) and I don't have much beyond rice and peanut butter sandwiches (LIVING THE DREAM.) and won't get money for about a week.   If you get us a pizza, I'll make you a drawing of whatever you like! I have a gallery here, you can choose whether it's worth much. http://auto-de-filet.deviantart.com/
0	It's 730 am where I am and would love a pizza for lunch!  No sob story here, I'm not starving, I'm not dying, just a student on a budget who would love to have a pizza!  If someone finds it in their heart to bestow a pizza upon me, I'll pay back right before Christmas to make someones holiday better! Anyways, Cheers!
0	My Dad and stepmom are having their 5 year anniversary tonight! They're heading into boston and i would love pizza for the rest of the family (Tim, Kraig, Carl, Randy and Kev + Me) But i am all out of money until Thursday! Will pay it forward!
0	hey reddit,                             we are a 23 and 22 year old married couple no kids or anything but my wife is a student and i work at a crap job. i dont get paid til the end of the week and she just had to deal with some family problems so i was trying to cheer her up. i dont want to go into details abot what shes going through or anything. its personal but i can assure you even the smallest thing at this point would cheer her up. i just love her so much and hate to see her upset. ive used this site before and have bought pizzas for people before i was just wondering if i could possibly get one today and i could pass the favor on at the end of the week. thanks for at least reading this i hope you find it in your heart to help us. thanks again.
1	Had some really bad days lately. I'm really down on my luck. A pizza would really make my day better.
0	recently lost my job blah blah same old give me pizza attitude. but really, it'd be nice and help a lot!!!
0	Been in kind of a funk lately. Had to pay too much for books I'll only be using one semester, I can't find another job to save my life, and me and my gf have been in fight mode excessively as of late... Papa John's won't fix my problems but it certainly would be nice right about now.
0	What a sad time.
1	Katy, Texas. Wouldn't die of hunger, but it would be cool if one of you fine gentlemen/ladies could give me some pizza love! btw, new to the community.
0	Money is being wired to me as we speak, but it looks like it won't be here until tomorrow. My fridge will be empty for at least another day... Will write a true sob story, short story, persuasive essay, one-on-one written RP, play any of the co-op games on my Steam, draw anything to the best of my abilities, or do pretty much anything reasonable in return for a pizza.  Request will expire tomorrow at 10am Eastern because I will no longer require help and I refuse to accept pizza when I am capable of purchasing it myself.  I'm into equivalent exchange and karma, and I will put pizza in a less fortunate redditor's mouth if helped.
1	There is 3 of us working the swing shift in GA (2 Air Force and 1 Navy) We are all broke till the 15th. When we get paid we will pay it forward back to the cause of pizza!
0	Missed some work last week, put me behind on bills and stuff. The flu sucked but I'm better now, just broke.. I can haz pizza please?
0	Summer break has not been good to me this year. The jobs I've been hoping to recieve have slipped through my fingers and the few jobs I have been able to get have been low pay and barely covering the bills. I finally got a new job where I was making a little bit of extra money and decided to treat myself nice for the first time in months and buy a few cool things on Amazon, right after that my car breaks down. Im living on oatmeal, rice and ramen... I really think a nice pizza would warm my spirits. If anyone could help out, i'd really appreciate it! 
0	Hi, I'm new here obviously, found this through a random acts of kindness group I participate in.  My family has had a rough patch the last few months, we had some friends stay with us for what was supposed to be a couple weeks but turned into a couple months where they took advantage of us and basically left us in a really bad place financially because they broke our furniture, took almost all of our childrens toys and really didn't help pay for anything except about $600 in groceries a month when they were a family of 6 not very small people.  Needless to say though we're in the last week of the month and our kids have been troopers through all this and we'd really like to get them a special pizza treat but only have $4 to our name.  My husband and I have 2 beautiful kids a 6 year old girl and 2 year olf boy. Starting next month we'll also have my 9 year old stepson and hopefully by then we will have finished recovering financially from all this.  Thank you ahead of time and we look forward to giving the gift of Pizza to someone else who could use it or needs it on the first. We are in Colorado.
0	Parents went out of town for Memorial Day weekend and since they didn't buy groceries they were going to leave money so I could just buy some food, but they forgot to do that too.
0	**Never mind, my friend bought me one because he is wonderful :)**
0	My roommates have all decided to smoke some weed and as a result are taking away the much needed nourishment of a college student. Would like a pizza please.
0	Recently broke up w/ my gf and sure its happened a few times before but I always have trouble making myself eat unless its right there in front of me, also I'm very broke, I think I have like 4 dollars.  Thanks you!
0	spent every dime i had for my dog to get surgery to get an abscess in his throat removed and check for cancer...he is 14, just thought about this subreddit and figured a pizza might help me feel better....
1	I'm 36 weeks pregnant, and currently broke until payday tomorrow.  I've been living off of ramen noodles and cereal the past few days, but my supplies are dwindling.  Here's proof - http://i.imgur.com/PRbVY.jpg Thanks reddit! 
0	So, Here is the story, it starts on Thursday 22nd February 2012. I have had a hectic month and have all but run out of money, by the time i realised i wasn't getting paid till the 1st i had maybe 3 or 4 pounds left in my account. Now i am already a student...a student who pays his own rent, and even with the maintainance loan and overdraft find myself on the poor end of the stick a lot. Now i as i am sure you are, am a lover of a good pizza.    But with only 4 pounds i resigned myself to having to wait till the 1st. So for one week i lived on the 11p noodles at tescos, 3 meals a day of 11p noodles, With the promise of a pizza on the 1st though, my mind was battling through. 28th of Feb and low and behold it is a leap year this year....ok i say, that's fine, one more day, few more noodles i can deal,  I've come this far already.    The first hits, and the thought of my pizza is incredible, my mouth is watering at the idea as i get out of bed. And the first thing i do is go to check my balance and pay my rent....Oh what's that? yes. My bank details were stolen? Virus on my computer? Now not only is the idea of my pizza gone, but the fear of being unable to pay my rent is gripping me tightly, i call the bank immiediately, and have my accounts frozen and my cards cancelled. it's evening seeing as i have a bad sleeping pattern and probably only woke up at around 5pm. i cannot make it to a bank today to check my balance, and with no cards, i definately cannot buy a pizza :( But tomorrow i tell myself. Tomorrow.   i head in the next day and check my balance the money is there, Phew, i take out enough money for my rent and be on my way. Oh no you cry, where is the money for my pizza. Well i forgot about that. and manage to fall asleep at about 5am that night waking up for bank closing on saturday. Great. Tomorrow is sunday. No pizza then either, And if my card doesn't arrive tomorrow i may have to wait even longer for my pizza. So i call out to you. To all you Pizza samaritans. Help me. In my hour of need, I call upon you reddit.
0	so I get off in an hour of posting this and still have a ton of things to do around the house, I have no idea when she will be home, but I would love to have something there for both of us to be able to eat. If anyone would like to help us out I would be grateful!
0	I just got home from a long bicycle trip around NJ only to find I had missed some important mail from UI.  I have enough food in the house to survive until I get it straightened out, but I could sure use a pizza.
0	This sub reddit is awesome
1	Today's the day I have to buckle down and get my reading done for the week so that I don't fall behind.  The fiancee is at work and there's no food in the house.
0	Just a broke college student alone on a Saturday night that could use the company of a warm pizza
0	Hi reddit, I'm new (but am enjoying this place so far!) so I hope this is still allowed. I'm an ex-Amish youth from a strict religious sect in Ohio who decided to leave during rumspringa. I have never had the chance to eat pizza or most other foods that are not home made until recently, but now I am in college and can do what I please.   I am pretty money-less at the moment and would love to be able to eat a pizza, and share it with my roommate. I am in Michigan, in the USA. I can post pictures of my first pizza eating experience if someone decides to help. Or if anyone has any questions, feel free to ask me. Thank you reddit!   Edit: Still no pizza :(! Welcoming questions, though!
0	Pulling an all nighter looking for some pizza. Any food at all would be much appreciated. Thanks 
0	Hey guys! This is my first post on here and I wanted to tell you that people like you restore my faith in humanity. I am a broke college student who is working his way through college. My family supports me, but can not give me money at this time.  I work a full time job at a minimum wage place just to get my tuition and rent. Things are a little tight for money since the new school year is coming up. So i came to you guys who might have a little extra money to throw at us poor people. I could really use a hot pizza from where ever and it would be much appreciated! Thanks! 
0	All this week, these students are working hard on getting this musical perfect, and they don't have anything for dinner. Anyone willing to give them some pizzas for Monday-Wednesday? The students would greatly appreciate it! PM for any questions. We can perform a song or two if someone wants? :)
0	My wife and I have gone through hell after the birth of our son. Wife is suffering from postpartum psychosis, and getting screened for possible lupus. This has been needless to say very stressful. I have a promising job interview tomorrow and could use a delicious pizza instead of another night of ramen. I will pay it forward as soon as I can, either through work, or TANF.
0	I'm new to Reddit, but I love all the different things that go on here. I am requesting just a small or whatever is cheapest pepperoni, and I will send you one back in return tomorrow. I'm not exactly sure how this all works, I've read the sidebar but let me know what else I need to do.  And also, if this does go how I'm thinking, I will certainly become a regular contributor. 
1	I have given a couple times on here, and it's kind of hard for me to ask now. :) I would love to celebrate my son finishing school with a pizza "party" with his little bro and I. If it doesn't come through, it's all good :)
1	On Sept 30th our baby boy Ezra was born and unexpectedly had a long NICU stay in a hospital over an hour away from our home... and that really drained our account.  We have two other kids, and my husband being out of work for so long while I stayed to breastfeed the new baby in the NICU unit made money even tighter, and on top of everything else, we got a SPEEDING TICKET heading to the hospital initially to have him, no joke!  He sure is cute though and worth ALL we went through a million times over: http://img215.imageshack.us/img215/9149/ezra016.jpg  Today my husband texted me twice from work that he is depressed.  He totally forgot he missed his certification test (that we had to pay for!) this morning because he was doing his defensive driving course online for 6 hours and had too much on his mind.  Then his watch broke at work :(  He won't be home for another hour and I feel so bad for him, he is really feeling down on himself since we are so short on money and everything has gone so wrong.  A pizza would really cheer him (and our 2 toddlers!) up.  Even our German Shepherd would appreciate the scrap pizza crust - poor girl has been here by herself a lot lately. I would appreciate it SO much, and we would gladly post a picture upon receipt to show our appreciation.  We live in Texas, and Pizza Hut sounds HEAVINGLY.
0	https://www.facebook.com/TheRomanCandle?fref=ts  Today we are donating to a GREAT cause! The East Washington Day Shelter, a shelter for the homeless, collected hot pizzas from us to serve their guests. The shelter only serves from 12-2pm and is serving roughly 75 people!  There's still more that's needing. Because of that we'll be donating today, tomorrow, and Friday. We are only donating 5 a day - and that's where YOU COME IN!  If you're interested in donating a pizza to the shelter tomorrow or Friday please call our Willy St location (608-258-2000) before 12pm to sponsor a donation. It's getting cold out and there's nothing more needed than warm food. Please help us support this shelter!
0	Hey there. I have no money on me and I would like to have a Pizza, preferably with mushrooms on it. It'd be nice.   Location: High Point, NC.
1	That's right! I'm finally employed. After being poor for almost a full year, I am now capable of actually buying things! Except not yet. My first paycheck was to be today, but an error occurred with the direct deposits and so I have to wait for the check to come in the mail now. I'm not a sob story in need of something to eat, but i am hungry and would love a stuffed crust pizza or something. Please and thank you! 
0	We have two children - both under the age of 4 - and three adults who have been eating nothing but rice for almost two weeks. We have no money for food let alone anything else. I heard about your RAOP Kindness and wanted to know if we could have some sent this way. 
0	Hey RAoP  This is a throwaway account but I'd be happy to PM you from my real account as verification. I've given before and never received.  First up I'd like to say that pizza is NOT necessary and we won't starve without it. Not even a bit. We've got some leftovers in the freezer and a bunch of odds and ends in the cupboards and even a bunch of friends who'd take us out to dinner or have us over if we asked (but we'd feel bad asking because we're old enough to be meant to be beyond this!). So, absolutely no worries if no-one can give.   I'm asking because a bunch of unexpected grown up expenses just ambushed us. My boyfriend's grandfather died unexpectedly and we wanted to go to the funeral - but it was 5 hours away and we didn't have a car. So we bought a cheap car and made it to the funeral, but it turns out that car ownership is super expensive. Rego is nearly $1000! Add insurance, NRMA membership (needed cos we weren't sure whether our little bomb of a car would make the drive and we didnt want to be stranded in the australian outback forever), random fees for vehicle inspections and more random fees just for existing add up to be the value of the car again! What. The. Hell. (yes, I *have* lived a sheltered life, thank you for asking.)  Add that to the billion and one other things we're saving up for/need to pay (rent, bills, house deposit, wedding, honeymoon maybe, helping our families) and it's come as a bit of a shock to our financial system :P We literally have $0.67 in the bank and a bit of change in cash until pay day. This is an odd and disconcerting feeling.   What would pizza mean to us? Laughter and joy. The pleasure of knowing that there are good people who care about strangers. A memory to carry with us both when things are hard and when things are good and we can give again. A small easing of financial stress for the next few days.   I might also pull the request later because like I said - it's most definitely not a do or die type situation. And anyway, my credit card's taken such a pounding this week, what harm is pizza going to do? :P  But thanks for reading anyway, RAoP!  Also, please and thank you ;)
1	[Edit:  Fountain, Colorado]  My wife and I live on my social security, and anyone out there on it knows the dates for benefits always suck because it never pays on the same date, always making things bad.  Our families are several states away and they're broke too.  My grandmother sent us cookies a few days ago and that's what we've lived on other than some instant rice.  We even started googling whether we can eat the cat's food.  We usually only eat one meal a day and a pizza would get us so much closer.    I have been pizza'd before in a contest and we gave that away months ago to someone who needed it a lot more than us.   Thank you RAOP.
1	We are a cool group of three folks that are super hungry and unfortunately we are all out of food! One of us is getting food stamps in two days but in the meantime a delicious internet pizza would Rule!
0	My 18th birthday tomorrow. Not doing anything because all my friends have school but would like a pizza to eat while Im home chillin with my new kitten, Mrs.Nesbitt. :)
0	I don't really know how this works, I just found out about this subreddit,  but basically I'm a broke college student living with my boyfriend, who (he, not I) earlier this month became unemployed. I would love to surprise him tonight with something other than rice or ramen noodles, even if only to lift his spirits just a little bit. Hopefully somebody here could help me do that for him. 
0	I have $3 in my account and am spending the night preparing a presentation for class tomorrow. Will trade information on ocean acidification for pizza
1	First time making a request. Money is tight recently thanks to a shift change at work and losing my 10% night shift differential. I'm off today and tomorrow so no rush :) thanks in advance
0	We are both redditors looking for some goodness on a day of tomfoolery.
0	I live in the Twin-Cities area (MN). If you buy me a pizza, I promise to but a pizza for another redditor once i get paid.
0	My bf.   He finishes work at 9pm and I think he would be really chuffed if he came home to a RAoP (I think he deserves it). Just thinking about how happy his (rather attractive) face would be is making me smile lots and lots.   He is in love with Reddit forevz and would likely reimburse you with a witty song or nice picture of something bad ass.  Thanks for reading, I hope you might like to help ;)
0	I will owe you the world. Thanks.
0	Hi, family here in need of some extra assistance. Would greatly appreciate a hot meal for tonight and tomorrow. I am a long time "reddit lurker" and I am aware of people being hesitant on here to give to the noobs. I am hoping that someone helps us and the kids out though. I am aware of r/food pantry and will be asking for groceries but for tonight if anyone can help, we will appreciate it. Thanks!  p.s. sorry if this is too wordy
0	I figure that between a pizza and the rice that I have left that I can eat at least until I visit my family for Christmas. I've set aside the money it will take me to catch a bus to join everyone for this "holiday tradition", but buying anymore food will be very tight until about Jan. 2nd, when my next paycheck comes in. Happy holidays to everyone regardless of anything else. You people are all amazing and I wish you all the best!      This is an Xpost from r/randomactsofpizza
0	In the Clifton area, unemployed for a month and half now, down to my last scraps. Anything would be much appreciated. Send PM for details. Thank You.
0	I HAVE  3 YOUNG KIDS AGES 2 MONTHS, 1 YEAR, AND 2 1/2 YEARS OLD. IWOULD LIKE TO POST MORE BUT ITS TO PERSONAL..PLEASE WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A NICE FAMILY MEAL FOR ONCE INSTEAD OF PB&amp;J SANDWICHES,AND TOP RAMEN.  THANKS..GOD BLESS..
0	living with a crazy vegan health nut who thinks our baby should only eat tofu and wheatgrass and green smoothies with Chia seeds. My baby wants to EAT ALL THE PIZZA! I decided to leave it up to fate...that's where you come in. SOMEONE PLEASE GET THE PREGNANT LADY A PIZZA!
0	Hello good folks of RoaP! I have heard of this mythical land where kind redditors help other redditors eat the most wondrous of foods and I figured "Hey, I'm a broke redditor who enjoys pizza. It's worth a shot!"  I won't bore/lie to you about how I'm homeless, jobless, deaf, or anything silly. I am simply a kind redditor of just over a year who would humbly like some pizza. As soon as I am able, I will gladly pay it forward in the future (Paydays are Wednesdays!)  All the same, thanks so much to you kind folks, and keep up the random acts of deliciousness.
0	I play music! Unfortunately that does not necessarily pay the bills or keep me fed. Here's me playing guitar: https://soundcloud.com/will-james-guitar  I hope one of you beautiful people out there could spot me some Papa John's? When I get a real job I'll be sure to come back and pay it forward :)
1	Hey all, I hate that I have to be this guy, but I know you people are incredibly generous. My name's Chris, I'm 20 and I live on my own (in good old Cincinnati, Ohio). I am out of money and food (I literally have 35 cents and a can of beans /no hobo). I'm currently applying for all sorts of jobs so I don't have to be in this situation for long but I'm still waiting for something to come of it. On a random sunday evening, a pizza would be mighty fine.
0	Not sure whether this is working with germany or not... but yea I'm pretty very short on money, everyone in my area is celebrating Germany in the Euro 2012, can't even afford to do that atm. A pizza could do good things for me now. :=)
0	That's my only request. This sub has turned into a bad episode of Dr. Phil... This is supposed to be fun and random, not acts of sympathy pizza.   I hate to sound heartless, but come on! Everybody has problems and should try and deal with them on their own time. If your dog dies, or you lose your job, I do feel bad for you, but that isn't what this sub is about. You should be with your family and feiends, not trying to figure out deep dish or thin-n-crispy from Pizza Hut...   It has become a pity party, not a pizza party. Let's keep the crying to a minimum...   Downvote if you must, but this is my only request. Let's keep this lighthearted... Sorry for the rant fellow pizza lovers... Keep on pizza-ing on...
0	Me and a friend have spent the entire night sitting in my dorm room playing Super Mario World. We're on Chocolate Island right now, but just realized that we missed dinner. And, of course, we're both broke. But we really want to 100% this game tonight, so any nourishment would be very nice, and I would love you forever! I'd be happy to take a picture when we beat the game tonight :)  Proof: http://i.imgur.com/AYUph.jpg http://i.imgur.com/MuEXZ.jpg
0	Hey guys,  I promised myself I wouldn't do this because I'd feel terrible, but after not eating anything for the past days (except German chocolate), I figured I would at least try this.   So here's the [true] story: Student (of course), living in Canada (parents live in Michigan]. I am absolutely broke as my most recent funds were drained into parking tickets and a plane ticket for my brother's wedding.   I'm not going to complain that my situation is worse than anyone else's-- I have my sweet hamster asleep on my leg and I have season 4 of 30 Rock, so I'm bearing with it. *swallows pride* But I'm starving. If you're generous enough to send me pizza, give me your address and as soon as I have money for shipping I will send you out all the German chocolate I have, as well as a post card and a bag of Reeses Peanut Butter cups. I will do anything to make it even with you. And be your pen pal. :)  Thanks in advance. Seriously. 
0	So the girl I came to California with bailed leaving me to pay the entirety or the bill for the place I rented. Cutting down my already tight budget. Anybody wanna help me out?
0	Sister got called into work unexpectedly and three of her kids got dropped off with me. I wouldn't mind pizza for myself and the two eldest, thirds is only like 6 months old so no pizza for her. More than likely to pay it back or forward after September 9th. Thanks! Oh and I've got a verification code if you want that.
0	Hey everybody,  I stumbled into this subreddit yesterday, and the kindness and generosity that is flowing through here absolutely warms my heart.  I don't have a sob story or a starving family to feed, just a kid putting himself through college, so I'm saving every penny I scrape together.  If someone saw it in their heart to help a complete stranger out, I would be incredibly appreciative. 
0	Being poor sucks. I haven't had a hot meal that didn't come from my microwave in forever :( Id love it if you guys can help out♥   
0	I wont see my first cheque for another month (I am low on funds in mye bank account) so my parents as nice as they are have footed my rent bill (1 month), I know i'll be running out of groceries soon. Pizza is my favorite food and It could easily push a few more days untill I need to start dipping into my near empty bank account for new groceries, which will def. be canned goods. 
0	My sister and I have been living off Publix cookies and a pizza would be freaking amazing right now.
0	Hi Reddit!!  My husband and I celebrated our first wedding anniversary yesterday, but due to being broke and having to work we didn't get to celebrate! Today we are hoping to celebrate making it a year with some pizza, if you can help us out!  We greatly appreciate it :)
0	Yep, spent my entire Thursday night singing song covers for the nice people of Omegle. Just in the mood for a delicious pizza right about now.
0	My roommate and i have fallen on some hard times lately, nothing to bad, mostly money problems. I spend a lot of time with my girlfriend, cooking for us most of the time at her house. I havent been the best friend to him lately, and i know he would really enjoy a piece of pie from some random stranger on the internet! Dang, just getting a bit choked up thinking about him getting a random pizza. Anyways, if anyone is up for a Random_Act_Of_Pizza, feel free to PM me! AMA you want, i will be here for a little while. EDIT: Roommate went for an interview this morning clear across town, used our last 14 dollars (change) to get him there. i know he would really enjoy a pizza today, if anyone is still around to send him one! Thanks again - 
0	Hey there, RAOP!  I'm new to this subreddit and figured I'd put up a request since I have a tough couple days ahead of me.  I have exams in both of my 400-level classes on Monday and I'd really appreciate a pizza to get me through all the dense reading I have to do! In one of my classes we're learning about altruistic behavior in humans, so a pizza gift from a random Internet stranger would be especially appropriate food for thought ;)   Have a great weekend, everybody! 
0	I have been in pain this whole week. I couldn't eat anything but like yogurt. I havn't gotten good sleep because my painkillers only last for 6 hours at a time. But today, I am finally able to eat substantial foods and i have been craving a pizza for a very long time. but sadly, i'm broke :[   I just discovered this subreddit and am going out on a limb. I feel bad since i see a lot of people that might be in a worse situation than me, but all i know, is that i will come back to RAOP because this place is awesome. I will return the favor. i hope my request is met cuz im dying of pain and craving over here.   THANKS in advanced  [3]
0	Freelance graphic designer here, looking to help you with any design work you may need, in return for food. Thanks for your time!
0	Please I'll &lt;3 you forever.
0	My wife and daughter went to a funeral. I don't feel like cooking for my son and I. Anyone feel like sending pizza? Only place nearby is Pizza Hut.
0	Hungry as heck, I'm just looking for a good pepperoni pizza delivery, by Dominos or Pizza Hut, or whatever delivers home. First post, tell me if I'm doing something wrong. Thanks, and Happy Holidays!  EDIT: Would need the pizza TONIGHT, no later. Thanks again!
0	No sob stories, no bullshit, nothing. I just want a free pizza.  I'm in Northville, MI
0	So, a friend got screwed out of a place tonight (landord dick-ness), and as such is stuck using what little money she has left paying for a hotel in Southwest Florida. If you kind pizza-ers can give her a hand that'd be swell. I know it's not me, but she's never used Reddit, and College has also left me quite poor. You have my word that I will pay it forward. Thanks regardless!
0	I lost my job about a month ago and have had no luck in finding a new one. I just ended up having to move back home as well because I could no longer afford to pay rent. I'm not starving or going to go hungry, but a pizza would be really great right now, and I would much rather have it than easy mac for the 4th night in a row. I'll happily repay it as well once I finally have a job again!
1	anyone out there feeling generous to help me out with a amazing pie? starving over here. thanks for looking =D
0	hello fellow redditors,  I am a contract programmer, and have been waiting over a week and a half for Canada Post to deliver at least one of my recent pay cheques.  So far I've managed to get by on a bit of groceries I had in my cupboard and from the food bank... but these supplies have unfortunately run dry.  Every day, I check the mail like an eager kid waiting for that parcel he ordered from the back of a comic book... but so far, nothing.  I tend to be really generous when I do have cash and have bought many meals for hungry folks... and will certainly be putting up an [Offer] post in here when my cheques finally do arrive.  If anyone out there sympathizes with the daily sinking heart feeling of waiting for that *special and important piece of mail*... please help a brother out?  Thanks guys!  **EDIT:** I live in Victoria, BC, Canada ... Postal Code: V8T 4A6 ... there is a [Pizza Zone](http://www.pizzazone.ca/) and a [Palagio Pizza](http://www.palagio.ca/) very close by to me!
0	I posted in the other subreddit but though I'd try here too.   Hi reddit. This is my first time ever doing something like this but here I go.  I am requesting a pizza to feed two adults in Westminster MD. My fiancé and i are behind because I broke my ankle in July and have been out of work since because the break required extensive surgery. All pizza chains are equally distant and would require us to pick up.  My fiancé doesn't get paid until next Friday and his parents can only help so much, mostly with money for utilities and prescriptions for both of us. We have maybe $20 to our name and he has a full work schedule next week as well as having to take me to a follow up appointment with my surgeon on Monday, who is located a thirty minute drive away.  We've been eating a lot of PBJs and ramen and our ramen is running out so a pizza could really help out a lot. When we have gotten two pizzas in the past,they have lasted us for three-four days.  Thanks for your consideration and time reading this.  ETA : I do have a verification code for this sub. :)   Edit: pizza received. Thanks so much mcpeepants34!
0	I just took my last final (advanced organic chemistry) and haven't had anything to eat yet because i was studying all day. I would love some pizza right now. I will forever be grateful to you :)  I live in Goleta, California
0	I'll spare you the hard luck story; I'm sure you've heard it before. My partner and I have been battling the economy for a couple of years now. We've been blessed with a place to live and been able to keep the electricity and the tubes, but food has been scant and invariably cooked by me. A pizza would be a goddess-send. We're in the SF Bay Area, CA. I know I'm a new account; I would be happy to provide proof that I'm a real person.
1	Hello RAOP  I have an old friend in town this weekend. He is stopping by later today to watch some football and hang out for a while. I have no real food in my house to offer while he is over here, and I don't get paid until the end of the week. I hate to be a bad host, could anyone help me out with a delicious pizza to feed us growing men? I will be paying it forward regardless at the end of the week.  I live in Wilmington, DE (Right outside Philadelphia). I have all the majors around, Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns.  Thanks for considering helping me out!!
0	Hi there. My name is Naru, and quite frankly, I'm really, really hungry. I just lost my job last week, so I have no money. :( I would really appreciate a pizza, even just a small one. Thank you for your time.
0	I have been clean for a year and I'm still trying to get my life back together. My mother has been my rock through all of this and I would like to have a nice family dinner tonight. There's no way I could ever repay her for everything she has done for me. I want to thank her for having a hand in my sobriety as well as never giving up on me. If someone could help my family have a nice meal today, I promise to post pictures. Please help make my 1 year clean a real celebration.   We are in Des Moines, Iowa. If you're in the area, you're more than welcomed to join us. Thank you.
0	I'm 20 and live on my own. I'm not poor or necessarily starving or anything but I cant just order a delicious pizza for just myself. Costs too much. Well, hopefully the pizza gods will smile down on me today, thanks guys.
0	Like the title says, it has been a rough month and my husband and I are a little short til payday. If anyone is willing to do this we would be  SO grateful and can pay it back on 11/5. Thanks for looking!
1	I volunteer at a firehouse and we love pizza!!
0	I dont have any cash on my credit card, just on my paypal, if anyone on here is willing to order a pizza for me I'll send you however much my order  costs plus $10 through paypal, thanks.
0	Hello Redditors!  Like the title says, my girlfriend and I are writing a "How to lease your first apartment" guide for all the new freshman and sophomores who are going to start signing leases next week. See, around here the apartment companies build up this hype that all of the best apartments will be gone if you don't sign on Oct 5th. This is such shit! We were able to both get out of really shitty leases and move into a great place halfway through the year and pay less than what . By perpetuating this myth, the leasing offices show kids shitty apartments and make them believe that these are the best ones that are "left" and that the students should pay $400 - $600 per PERSON for these shit holes.   Basically, we are writing a guide for these students so they wont get screwed. I know that you guys are namely good at giving out pizza (which would be greatly appreciated) but any good advice you have for leasing an apartment is appreciated as well!   Edit: On Illinois State University campus. Any /r/ilstu -ers out there?  My rough outline: [Dropbox Link to Document](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/6234318/Lease%20Stuff.docx)
1	So I got pizza'd from this subreddit a couple months ago, maybe 3, not sure. Anyway, I haven't been able to eat out in a long ass time, still getting owned by all of my bills and having recently moved out  I thought I'd give this another go
0	Wrapping up my last semster of college, amongst working part time and getting paid bi-weekly I have no food at home to speak of, what with an empty fridge and bare cabinets my hunger grows to an inmeasurable depth. Can a fellow anon help a redditor out by putting some pizza in their growling stomach. I will return the favor when my part time job pays me at the end of the month. 
0	Bonus: bees. http://imgur.com/a/zjHQs 
0	Like the title says, had to pay an unexpected bill that I was going to pay this coming Friday on payday. We thought we had until friday but it turns out that we didn't. Wasn't able to buy food for us this week in trade of having gas to get to work. Anyone out there in a charitable mood today? :)
0	I work at 546 Poplar Street in Macon, Ga. Myself and my coworker would love some food, but neither of us have the money for food.  Can you help? We will shower you with love. 
0	Okay, so I'm not exactly in the worst place seeing as I am living with my parents. But, due to circumstances with them, we've been in really tight money for about three years now. And we've been getting by food wise on food banks, and some meat (mostly chicken) on payday. It's looking up recently, but that doesn't change the fact that I haven't had any sort of pizza in a little over three years. So, it'd great to get some from one of you guys. Verification can be given when it's set up. 
1	I am packing up the belongings of the house I grew up in, before I turn the keys over to the bank. I am prepping my cat for a week and a half of boarding, so that he has somewhere to stay, while I couchsurf and scramble to find a job. I spent the last of my unemployment today hiring a U-Haul and I'm down to leftovers. I could really use some comfort food right about now, with the added bonus of having something for breakfast in the morning.  Edit: I will more than happily repay this kindness if/when I get back on my feet.
0	I graduated at the end of June and only just now found a job. It's an amazing opportunity and I'd like to celebrate with my SO but as of right now we are completely broke. 
1	I'm working on a mountain in Vail Valley, CO this season, not getting paid very well, and am forced to live on a very tight budget (less than $10 a day). This is a very expensive place to live. I just got my first paycheck and all of it went to the person I am renting from. I am willing to do just about anything (legal) that is requested. I'm very hungry and hoping that someone can help me out! I promise to return the favor when I am able to! Thank you in advance! 
1	We cannot spend any money right now and just thought I'd give it a shot! It would mean a lot to us and we will record some of our epic dances moves in the form of a thank you video!
0	Admittedly, I was doing pretty well.  I was not having any financial problems and I was able to save some money.  Then my job cut my pay rate.  Suddenly I was struggling to pay the bills, but I managed.   Last week my wife went from being able to breast feed our son to completely dried up.  Now we have the added expense of lactose intolerant formula (he can't drink milk based stuff; it makes him sick) and a reduced income.  Faced with the decision of eating or feeding our son, we opted for the formula.  Unfortunately, I will not receive my paycheck until Saturday. We have enough formula for our son, but we've literally run out of food for ourselves.  Two days without food is not a lot -- and we could manage without -- but I would love to greet my wife with pizza tomorrow.
0	This weekend my vehicle took a poop and now its a 1200 dollar repair to get my car fixed. I cant afford that for a whole month and on top of that, I go into work today and they tell me at the end of the month I will be let go from the company because of budget cuts. Single man with a little puppy to feed, got dog food, but a pizza would really bring my spirits up for today.
0	I opened up a computer shop here a couple of months ago and things have been decent work wise until this week. I have a couple of laptops a customer is paying for on friday and I had to buy the parts which zeroed me out =(. Hoping to have some brain food to keep working and make it to friday.
0	hey there.......wanted to use this and message some fellow redditors.....plus a good excuse to do some science!

0	I am hungry
1	Hi RAOP  I had to scrounge up what ever money I could find so I could get my dogs some dog food today. They ran out of dog food yesterday. The fridge is empty and I wont be getting any money till Tuesday. Can someone help out a guy and his two dogs? I'll share some with my dogs. I' sure they would love a slice, instead of eating that cheap dried stuff.
0	My parents are really uptight about me spending my money on food, and I'm getting hungry.
1	First time here, I have been living off of canned/packaged foods, which gets old fast. Since I can't afford to treat myself to cheesy goodness, can I please get a pizza? Please and thank you!
0	Will pay it forward asap.
0	Hell week is finally over and a pizza would be nice to help forget the possible failing. Actually, randomly receiving a pizza from some unknown person would be just the boost I need to forget this past week.
0	I'm at my friends house and we just had a craving for a nice pepperoni pizza. It would be awesome for anyone to send me a pizza, but please send one to someone who actually needs it first. But if you do send me a pizza I live in beaverton, OR. Message me for more info! Thanks Pizza givers!
1	I have been working for about a month now at my new job, and yesterday was my first paycheck. Instead of mailing ME my paycheck, they accidentally sent it to some random address in pennsylvania, and now I have to wait until next week when they can void my previous check and then mail me another one, since its "company policy" to not have paychecks sent to where I work. If someone can please help me with a pizza I would be eternally grateful, I am at my wits end, and I could really use a hot meal. Please someone help me out!  EDIT: I have received a pizza before from jerematic, I had put up a request and jerematic had put up an offer shortly after, after getting the pizza from jerematic I deleted my request since I had already gotten a pizza. Thanks Matt_and_Chelle for the help!
0	My fiance and I just moved to AK to spend time with his grandfather who is doing poorly and return to where he grew up. In doing so we have a grand total of 1.55 cents in change and would love to have something substantial to eat other then the few packs of ramen we have to live off of for a month which is worse then the food rationing we have to do with the pets the poor things. We would love a pizza miracle in our home! Next month when we have money we will pay it forward to another desperate soul &lt;3  http://imgur.com/a/51gOA  Thank you so much for the pizza 1n_my_opinion!!! It's divine and we couldn't wait to dig in!  
0	Leaving my old stomping grounds of Atlanta to head for greener pastures ( or well , flatter ones i suppose ) . Between the packing and getting a place to live set up im out of readily available cookware and expendable income , was just wanting to try and see if i could get a friendly and memorable send off from a town i love so much. Either or , thanks for the good times atlanta

0	Hey guys, I have been waiting two months for a large reimbursement check to arrive from a previous job, and am currently out of work until next weekend. I am an aspiring Shaolin disciple, training twice a day, and while the physical, mental, and spiritual benefits are the most beautiful experience, I am hungry all the time! Can anyone help me out tonight?  While we're here feel free to check out my websites:  www.nickwickstrom.com  www.fofaseng-chikung.com   Thank you!  Amituofo,  Nick
0	unemployed, not eating tonight, thought id at least try.
0	Just got a job and will have enough money to make rent! Huge relief, but the cupboards are empty. Anyone wanna hook me up with a congrats pizza? Abbotsford, BC would be sharing it with my S.O
0	Pretty much exactly what it says in the title. I don't get paid for another two weeks, but I'm not starving. I could just really go for something pizza-like and maybe a 2-liter of soda to curl up on the couch with. :)
0	Sitting here with myself, my two sisters, and my elder sister's boyfriend. We've been cooking our own meals the past few nights, but today I'm thinking pizza. Parents are coming home soon and we gotta start cleaning up.
0	We are two parents and a school age child trying to keep cool on this miserably hot day. A friend told me about this site and said she had luck with it a few weeks ago. If there is a person out there who could help out our little family with a pizza, I would be eternally grateful. We get paid next Tuesday and Thursday and would be glad to pay it back then. Thanks, sure hope this works.
0	I know I am in no way original or the most deserving of a pizza, but basically, here's my story: I met a girl awhile ago. We'll refer to her as an 80's metal musician. Let's say, Dave Mustaine. Dave and I started talking over a social media site, but for vagueness, we'll say headnovel. We met in real life shortly after, and became the best of friends very fast. About 3 months into hanging out, my ex-girlfriend called me while we were hanging out at my cabin, and I got upset because the ex was saying terrible things. To rectify this, Dave thought she should kiss me, and she did. Things went from best friends to Relationship pretty fast. But Dave had a boyfriend she never saw. Literally, NEVER. He asked her out, and from then on, it was a textual relationship. Eventually, I told her she needed to decide between the two of us, but she said she didn't want to hurt him. So I cut it off. Fast forward a few months ago, she came back into my life with a different boyfriend, one she actually saw. I wanted to hang out with her again because she saw eye to eye with me on more things than last time, which was a lot. She frequents reddit and other such sites, we laugh at memes and dumb things, hate everyone that is ignorant, we appreciate good music, and are very emotional. This time, reddit, she took my virginity while she was emotionally with her new boyfriend. I didn't regret it at first. I do now. Dave was made to choose between us once more, and she chose her boyfriend yet again. But for some dumb reason, I still talked to her up until about 24 hours ago. I wanted to fix it, to wait for this girl that I thought was the girl of my dreams. I still want to fix it. But she just hurts me. All day, I've tried to act normal, like hang out with friends and such, and I just feel removed from it. I just want some comfort food and to listen to punk music and be the stereotypical heartbroken teenage boy. TL;DR girl of my dreams breaks my heart and virginity and I would like some comfort food right now.  I'll pay it forward however you ask, if I can.  Location: Message for details. Thanks. 
0	Hi, information about the fire [here.](http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Morgan-Fire-Near-Mt-Diablo-Chars-1500-Acres-222950261.html)  I'll be stopping by the fire station myself later tonight and will be bringing homemade dishes... I'm thinking probably a few large casseroles or something easy to make in bulk. The thought crossed my mind that this seems like the sort of thing Reddit would love to help with.   Pizza donations can be sent to the ConFIRE Station #11 at 6500 Center St. in Clayton, CA. The firefighters have been working all day and night since the fire broke out yesterday, and I'm sure they'd appreciate some hot, cheesy slices of pizza!   To help you out, [here](http://www.yelp.com/search?find_desc=pizza&amp;find_loc=6500+Center+St.%2C+clayton%2C+ca&amp;ns=1&amp;ls=883fdc931eaafb15) is the Yelp page for pizza places near the address.   Hoping to be able to send at least 4-5 pizzas over there for dinner tonight. Let's make this happen! :)
0	I'm broke and sick of eating pasta. I just heard about this website, figured posting would be worth a shot. Saw that you guys like honesty so that's about it. I have food, it's just bland and been the same thing day after day.  anyway... I don't expect anyone will help but like I said, worth a shot.
0	Hey all,  It's been a while since i've been here, but i kind of really need it. My food plan has run out of money(2 dollars left) and my bank account is less than 10 dollars.   I'm a stage manager for one of our department shows, so I have very little time to eat at all in these next two weeks, let alone buy anything.  I haven't had a good pizza in a while due to lack of funds, and i really need to keep my energy up for the next week or so.  Is there any possibility that anyone out there could help me?  Thanks!
0	I currently don't have a vehicle and it doesn't look very good in the near future. I hitch rides to and from work while trying to save money. I'm saving everywhere that I can. If I get a free pizza, that will provide a couple of meals for us, saving more money for a car.
0	Not going to give a sob story, but it's been a rough year. It is however, looking up.  Just got a raise, but it wont kick in until next check. Just hoping someone could float a pizza, and the favor will be returned. Any more details or anything needed, just let me know. Thanks!
1	Just thinking a random pizza to come back inside to would make everyone's day and I would definitely be able to return the favor to someone else in the future!  In NJ and we'll be working out in the garden and general yard work as well as house cleaning for about 3-4 hours this Sunday morning. If anyone is rad enough for a random act of kindness we all at our household will be forever grateful to your supreme gratitude!   Will also share pictures of the tended to garden! The first Tomato is starting to turn red and my corn is growing taller everyday! 
0	I live in Azle a small town in the south, my good-'ol-boy dad dropped by without warning expecting food and a visit. Well I'm broke right now, won't get paid 'till Saturday so I hate to ask but anybody out there got a good heart and want to help?
0	Tomorrow is my best friend's birthday and lately she's been going through a financial rut. She and her mother live alone in a small house which they've been paying out the ass for. There have been many instances where I'll intentionally over bake something so I can give the extra to her and her mother. Unfortunately, I don't have the funds to buy her a pizza myself since I splurged on another gift I thought she might like.
0	Hey friends- I just moved to a new town to attend graduate school in the fall. I was told by my employer, Walmart, that transferring to a store down here would be no problem at all. As it turns out- the Walmart down here can't find a spot for me for at least a few more weeks. I will get my last paycheck in the mail (from the last Walmart I worked at) late next week, but my funds have dwindled from the move and I haven't been able to afford much more than a box of ramen to keep me full. I just learned that a church across the street from me runs a food pantry, but they're only open on Wednesdays. If a redditor would be kind enough to help me fill my belly this evening, I will gladly return the favor when funds return. Many thanks, Sarah
0	Im a kid with no job and my parents left with my brother to go to college.  I would like to eat something other than stale Ritz crackers :(

0	A person i went to school with posted this to facebook...I would normally help but I am pretty broke right now myself...but I still have food...if anyone wants to order them a pie I would gladly pay it forward when I'm not as broke   http://imgur.com/KZVYsc5.jpg 
1	I dont like doing this.. the whole asking a stranger for help thing. Ive always been more inclined to give than receive. Unfortunately, here I am with a request.   I live in a 2 bedroom apartment in Escondido CA. I have been paying rent here by myself for 2 months. Last month I finally found a roommate that seemed so promising. She gave her security deposit of 100 bucks and was planning on moving in tomorrow (june 1st). Two days ago she backed out.. I have 700 bucks in my account and dont get paid for 2 weeks. My rent is $1200. Needless to say I am freaking out.   I havent been shopping for food for 2 weeks, I have beans and rice left thank god.. Im starting to look like shaggy from scooby doo since I cant afford a hair cut. Im using TP from my work and dandruff shampoo as hand soap. There have been better days.  Look, I have been a RAoP reader for a while and I have always wanted to buy some deserving stranger a pizza. I know that there are people who deserve this more than me. Its kind of depressing having my first post here be a request. But this is my promise, the second I can afford to help others here, I will. The karma will be passed on. Im just at a low point and a simple pizza would really brighten my outlook.. thanks for reading guys. You all rock my socks with the kindness Ive seen here.
0	Would like to have a pizza tonight
1	Hey All, No reason in particular for wanting a pizza. Really just cause it's Tuesday... and I'm an art school student who loves pizza. Will pay forward. Will exchange for drawing, art, or other requests. Random pizza anyone?
1	Hey everyone, I graduated early on Monday but unfortunately about 3 hours before I was going to celebrate, my best friend called me saying her grandfather died and I've spent the last few days since then comforting her, making sure she doesn't focus on it, etc. This has lead to a lack of celebration and all I really want for graduating is a pizza. So if someone wants to help me celebrate, I'd really appreciate it.
0	I am a student looking for gastric entertainment.  If you are interested in offering a pizza, I will gladly accept and thank you graciously.  I will also gladly place an offer post when student loans are distributed (last week of August).  Need info?  PM me!  Thank you for your consideration.  P.S. I did the verification system.
0	I got fired from the shittiest place ever and i could really use cheesy goodness to cheer me up
0	First things first, this is a sock puppet account.  Second things second, I do have a reputable **real** account and I will talk to you on that account if you private message me first on this one. I'm the creator/mod of a top 50 most active subreddit (according to [subredditfinder](http://subredditfinder.com/)). It's also in the top 100 in most subscribed, fastest rising, and other categories. The reason why I even mention this is so you know I'm a real redditor and not some random outsider trying to exploit your generosity. I'm not using my real account name for reasons I will thoroughly explain if you IM me. Even if you don't plan on helping me.  Finally, what I **can** explain here in the open is this: I've lost 15lbs in ~1 week due to not eating. I've lost my appetite because of a major life crisis, but now as I'm trying to get back into the swing of things I need to be strong but severe loss of financial stability (i think the technical term is being broke as fuck) means that I'm starting to break down physically, and that will jeopardize my ability to get back on track with my life.  I would actually prefer groceries (maybe milk, bread, or eggs), but I know thre is no Random_Acts_of_Balanced_Nutrition out there. I don't even know if I can get food stamps by now, and even if I can it might be too late. Either way, I would appreciate pizza just as much.  Anyways, I realize that I am rambling, but I'd be more than glad to explain my full situation to anyone that cares. I just don't want to make this post searchable by a particular person for reasons I will explain.  If this sounds shady, I completely understand. But again, I will be more than glad to give full details in PM; info which can easily be verified.  Just don't contact me with a sockpuppet account. I don't want some troll to go and fuck me over with the sensitive info I give them. We can talk 1-on-1 with our legit accounts.
0	It's been a wonderful day. I have gotten stoned and watched futurama and enjoyed my day off. But now I am broke and hungry XD. Maybe I'll get lucky and someone feels the need to help this fella out.
0	Hello redditors, I am very hot and in need of a pizza. I have been living off yogurts for the past two days, I need real food.  If I heat up the oven it just makes the house hotter.  I will give any kind of proof, just ask.
1	This is kind of embarrassing for me... I can pay it forward the weekend of the 29th.
0	Hi, I am sorry to be here making a request. I am completly out of food stamps and a few days out until I get any cash. I was recently homeless and a friend let me move in with them and my children. It is suppose to be my night to figure out dinner but it is difficult with no food stamps or cash right now. I am in the Massachusettes area and could really use the help right now. Thank you and God Bless
0	I'm really hungry and I just want a pizza. I've been craving one over the past few days and I want a pizza. Papa John's or some local pizza is preferred. Thanks in advance. Edit: My friend can also draw you a cartoonish picture of your choice, if you'd like.
0	My little sister and I got an apartment together in Westminster, CA because all of our family moved to Idaho. Things are going great, except we don't have a refrigerator or any extra money for food. A pizza, or anything at this point, would really do the trick. We are asking for free food on the internet out of desperation. I wish I could give out pizza
1	Recently had lots of unexpected school related expenses come up, leaving me with 3 bucks in my account. Would love a pizza to break up the monotony of ramen/walmart canned lasagna/rice. I can provide proof, and will pay it forward as soon as I can (probably the check after this next one). Thanks.
1	Got caught up in some debts that have kept me from getting food for the past month, leaving me with whatever I've had in my cabinet, which is almost at its end. I finally get paid next Friday, and was hoping to get some food for tonight
1	Y_Y. Sorry, **do not** want to sound like a pity party, but I was on my way to Vermont from California to go back to school when Irene hurricane shit all over my face. Now I'm stranded in Chicago and I don't know what to do with myself since this has never happened to me before whilst traveling alone. I'm only a naive, pitiful 19 year old after all :(. And, the room charge was ridiculous so I can't really spare the moola for any delicious pie right now.   Well anyway, even if I don't receive any pizza tonight, daz cool! I know I'm not the only idiot attempting fly during a hurricane. Just some comments would greatly brighten my night! 
0	I've never been pizza'd before, so someone will need to tell me how this works. I can get to any of the big 3, but I and my wife prefer the Hut.  In a couple weeks, I'll pizza someone else. Again, I've never done this so someone will need to tell me how to pizza someone else.  Whether I get a pizza or not,  I'll still likely pizza someone in the coming weeks.  Thanks guys!!
0	My fridge broke 4 weeks ago and I've been surviving on the remaining junk food I have left and sometimes I go out in the supermarket to look for free food samples. I don't have much left in my place except for half bag of gold fish crackers and 2 bottles of soda. Most of my food got rotten and now I don't have much left to eat... I'm still looking for a cheap affordable fridge to replace the broken one. I'm an unemployed college student living with my sister in a small apartment and would love to eat something nice for one day. I haven't had pizza for a long time and would love if someone could help me out.  Thank you!
0	The Infinite Well of Ramen Noodles has run dry. The villagers were greedy, dipping too often into it with the ladle and tongs. Now the children shall starve... unless we can feed them another way?  For a nominal fee of providing edible sustenance that doesn't slurp when I eat it, I shall impart stories of epic proportions based on the whims of the provider. In other words I'll draft a short story based on whatever meaningful or outright ridiculous crap you come up with. Am I any good at writing? Well, I won a Presidential writing award in third grade for an essay I did. I also helped ghost write 2 published works, one of which is in it's fourth printing. The other one was just a paycheck, that lady never stood a chance from the beginning.  The genre is up to you, I can write anything fiction without much trouble. If you want Optimus Prime to viciously beat Rainbow Brite with a broken Buzz Lightyear doll, I'll assemble the necessary back story =). All created works are royalty free, so turn em in to short story contests, publish them in a magazine, whatever.  I am hoping for at least $25 dollars worth of food, I can toss together a good read for that much, and I can eat a couple days off that. But longevity wise I need food for the rest of the week, so the more you donate the longer it'll be. Offer is open to anyone and I will accept up to 3 requests for stories, just make sure if you want something "romantic" that it's tasteful or I'll be inclined to turn it down.  That is all, hope I can snag a few jobs and keep the fridge full for a few days, thanks in advance guys =)
0	Hi, my name is Deborah. I used to help run Burlington Emergency Shelter in Burlington, VT. It is a shelter to help provide housing for up to 22 homeless men and women. They only run on donations. No Federal or State funding is used. They rely on donations to provide a meal each night for their guests. Their guests are ordinary people that either lost their jobs or just couldn't work anymore. I personally know what it is like to be homeless as I had went to the shelter in need myself.  I would like to request that someone or some people would provide pizzas for a meal for the homeless. 10 pizzas would be enough. If anyone would like to help, you can find the shelter's website at beshelter.org. It would make alot of someone very happy!
0	Hey redditors! My 4 year old son had to have an anterior tibialis transfer to help correct his clubfoot.  The surgery went very well, and Shriner's ended up releasing him about three hours post surgery.  He's now regained his appetite and is requesting pizza. We'll make sure to post a "thank you" picture if we're gifted.
0	Living independently for the first time in my life. I would like to celebrate with some pizza.  Tucson, AZ
0	We have Dominos, Papa Johns (my favorite) and one or two Pizza Huts over here in Caracas.  
0	I'm stationed at WPAFB. My pay got all jacked up and they took everything back at once. That's a lot of money. Anyone in the air force understands how fucked finance can be. I crashed my car last week, my computer screen broke, my phone isn't working. I'm currently typing this in the tiny area of my screen that still works. I hate asking for charity since I've been poor all my life. But I've had such a bad run the past few weeks and I'm burnt out and flat broke. And since it's my food allowance, (BAS) that is fucked up, I can't eat at the dining facility on base using my military ID. I'd really appreciate some help, guys. If not, that's cool. I have oatmeal. I'm just so tired of oatmeal..  edit: When I get back on my feet, I intend to pay it forward. I believe wholeheartedly in that philosophy.
1	But i would love a pie.
0	EDIT: Pizza has been received. I will post pictures as soon as I stuff my face.  
0	hi! looking for some dinner tonight. i've recently started on a job hunt since getting my degree a couple weeks and haven't found success. sadly, i'm starting to go low on cash. i'll make sure to pass on the favor when i've making my own money. thanks!
0	Currently down on my luck, I'm unemployed, my cable got shut off yesterday and recently got dumped by my girlfriend. It's a Tuesdy evening and I'd love some pizza, what girl wouldn't? Anyone like to help me out? Sitting alone in my room with just my stomach growling to keep me company :(  Oh and I'm located in WA state
0	I haven't had any pizza the entire semester, and I have missed it very much. I don't have much left for my last month either, a bit of pasta, and ramen.   Would surely appreciate a pie sometime for some variety. Thanks for reading.
0	Been packing all day so I can move into a new place tomorrow, there'se no food in the house, and my funds are drained thanks to the new place's rent and deposit.  I get paid Friday so I will pay it forward / return the favor if anyone is kind enough to feed me tonight =)  I live around the downtown Los Angeles area.  Also, as a bonus I am a Computer Science major here at school, so if you'd like I can offer some computer support if you are having any issues you've been meaning to check out (no promises on being able to fix it, but you'd at least get a free diagnostic without taking it anywhere).  Just thought I might throw that in there as an extra incentive =)
0	I'm somewhat nervous about posting, and hopefully I'll get a reply. My Mom basically got gyped on her already insufficient paycheck. Our fridge is almost totally empty, as our pantry and freezer. We've already borrowed money from my aunt so we could make tacos.. just going through a really rough time. Could someone honor us with a RAOP?
0	You know you have the badass-ity somewhere deep inside of you. Maybe it's in your wallet. Check there first. Okay, it's in there? Good, here's the back story.  We have no food left for tonight, we're pretty much stuck until tomorrow without any sort of consumables. Yeah, sounds like a fun night, right? Not really? Well, maybe you can be the individual that solves this issue. That's right! For just ONE EASY PAYMENT, you could rest more easily tonight knowing that you helped out a group of four rather hungry individuals, granting them the sustenance to last until tomorrow.   ***This document translated from a received email.***  Original message is as follows: HELLO GOOD FRIEND MY NAME IS RAY ABU BIN AL-AKAY I AM WRITING YOU TODAY BECAUSE THE NEWS HAS BEEN BROKEN TO ME THAT SOMEONE DIRECTLY UPON YOUR LINEAGE HAS PASSED AWAY AND NAMED ME AS EXECUTOR OF THEIR WILL; ONE OF THE STIPULATIONS IS THAT YOU WILL WORK WITH ME IN ORDER TO MOVE THEIR MASSIVE FORTUNE OF 23.000.000,00 USD; AS A PROOF OF GOOD FAITH, I REQUIRE A SIMPLE ACT ON YOUR FORM, SOMETHING THAT ANY FELLOW OF GOD IN GOOD STANDING MAY PERFORM: PLEASE PROVIDE MYSELF AND MY ASSOCIATES PIZZA SO THAT WE MAY HAVE FUEL WITH WHICH TO NURTURE OURSELVES AND SUSTAIN UNTIL THE MORNING THAT WE MAY DRAFT UP PAPERWORK AND BEGIN TRANSFER IMMEDIATELY REGARDS RAY ABU BIN AL-AKAY ESQUIRE  (you should really turn your spam filter on btw)
0	Paid a buddy back, but it crushed my wallet. I could use some help guys.
0	Yesterday, I helped a fellow redditor out by finding a video he's been searching for in return for some pizza. [Link to thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/19u7rr/i_will_order_you_pizza_for_the_right_song/)    However, since he's in another country, his credit card couldn't go through, and he was unable to place an order online. So he sent me $24 through Paypal. :)  I've been in a sort of a rough patch, and haven't had a decent meal in weeks. So I was really looking forward to having pizza for dinner on a Saturday night. Unfortunately, I found out Papa John's and Pizza Hut don't accept Paypal.   Now I'm not sure if I'd be breaking any rules by doing this. If I am, please let me know and I'll take this down. If not, then I would be more than happy to send someone $24 through Paypal if they could order some pizza for me.   Proof of Paypal funds: http://i.imgur.com/7zPm5rt.png
0	Hey, first time posting in this subreddit. There is not really anything to eat in my house and I am starving. Maybe I could get a fairly sizeable pizza? Anything you can give is much appreciated, thanks!
1	Inbetween jobs and havent gotten my first paycheck for my new place, so im living off 3 dollars till next friday. All my money has gone to my bus fair since i take 6 buses a day to get to &amp; from work.  Living in MN and i believe everyone delivers to me, with alot of coupons.  EDIT: Pizza'd thank you /u/sevenzig ! 
0	i have no money till tomorrow, only have -$90 dollars in the bank, and tired of eating canned food and oat meal, would love to have some pizza for today. oh and it seems like i am starting to get a small fever too, yay me!
0	Morale is low at my work establishment. My department consists of 3 people so I'm not asking for more than one pizza, and we are not picky by any means. This would be an amazing moral booster for my team, and something we all will be paying forward in the future. 
1	**edit - uninvitedthirteenth gifted me a pizza. She's an awesome person!  Hello,  I don't have much to offer in exchange besides possibly creating a Sim for any Sims 3 players, but I'm stuck inside the apartment with a bad knee for the fireworks/festivities tonight and was wondering if someone might be out here who was looking to spread some cheer for the next year.  Thanks, and I hope your night is warm and in the presence of good company.  edit** In case you're wondering about the Sims 3, I submitted an album to /r/thesims a bit ago with some celebrity sims that I made: http://imgur.com/a/vYhfu
1	I had to take my son to the hospital today for a busted lip and he was such a trooper. I'd like to reward him with his favorite food. Can anyone help us out?
1	Title says it all mostly.  We spent that much because two of my classes required a revised edition of a book that started print this year and that came with a code for online software so we can do our homework online.  They were both $200+ each.   We literally have no money for food in our room other then Ramen Noodles and our cafeteria sucks.  They literally make more vegan options for lunch dinner then they do non vegan food.  Its horrible.  Could a kind redditor please help us out and provide us with some good ol Pizza for once?  The past 2 months have been miserable.  
0	We're sitting here chatting and watching the news to distract us from our hunger. Gratitude. What ever you can give is greatly appreciated 
0	Hey, we have a house full of hungry people here. The only money we have coming in at the moment is unemployment and, we don't get paid until tomorrow. If someone wanted to hook us up with some pizza that would be great.
1	She lives in Round Lake Beach, Illinois, which hasn't been hit super hard by the recession but certainly isn't doing well. She works as a waitress for a restaurant that just opened, and it's not doing too well. It's looking like she's gonna be unemployed soon. She's down to a day a week, and unfortunately I'm not in a position to help her out with food. A random pizza will help her eat something other than the stale remains of a box of wheat thins til her boyfriend gets back home to her on Monday.  EDIT: Thank you so much, Reddit. You made her week for sure!
0	Im craving pizza really bad, and i dont have enough money to buy one. Love it if any can donate me one! Thanks.
1	Hey,  Thought I'd give this a try. Been broke for some time and no food in the house. When funds are available, I can pay it forward. Feel like a pizza, any help?
0	My '99 Jeep Cherokee I've had for 10 years now was stolen today.  I've got little cash as it is and no mode of transportation.  A pizza would be fantastic tonight.
0	Like an idiot, I didn't budget well this month and have about 5000won ($5) to last until Tuesday.  Feeling a bit hungry.  Korea has Papa Johns, Dominoes, and Pizza Hut, but only Dominoes has a website in English.    If perchance someone hooks a brother up, I'll promise to pay it forward.
0	Not a lot left for money left for college. Looking for a job and pizza. Who will be my knight in shining pizza?
1	I've been out of work for a couple months now, dealing with my bi-polar disorder/depression. Reoccurring hospital visits caused me to give up my job and move back home and "start from scratch." I could use a lift. The money that I DID have saved has gone to help out around the house and i've not really been left with much else. I'm really not one to ask for handouts, but as far as food goes lately it's been slim pickens and a pizza sounds good :) Thanks for reading and if you can help, thanks, and if not, thats okay too.
1	Dominoes &gt; Pizza Hut &lt; Papa Johns  Also, we are from Rexburg, Idaho. And no, we don't put potatoes on our pizza...
0	Hi RandomActsOfPizza,   So, I'm having a terrible weekend. I got given a weeks notice at my "job" last week, and other places I've been talking to aren't calling me back. I'm going to run out of money soon, and now I've spent the last three days at home sick, and I am not even going to get my last couple days pay if I can't get well enough to go to work. I had my phone stolen a month ago, and my computer has nearly completely stopped working(and the warranty service has been ignoring me for two months), I'm not sure if I can post this without it freezing again.  RAOP, I'm tired, and hungry, and sick, and so discouraged. Would any kind soul be able to help me out?  Thanks so much.
0	Hi guys, I am a broke college student who has been living off of ramen and eggs for the better part of 2 weeks now.   I have a gig tomorrow that is paying well, but I had my last bag of ramen today and wont have any more food until tomorrow. I tried to make it last, but I'm at the point where I have finally swallowed my pride.  Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.  Thank you - duitse
0	Hey RAoP, I made a new account as to not alert my redditing (now ex) girlfriend.. I have had just about the shittiest couple weeks and it all started with my beautiful girlfriend of almost three years leaving me and now I don't have anymore money for food until Monday.  I would love it if someone would help a guy who is down on his luck but not going to give up.  She has dreams and aspirations that she didn't think could be fulfilled by being with me so I will now assume the role of the best friend I can be and support/always cheer her on and I hope she does incredible things in this world.  As for me, it's time to re-assess.  Cheers, RAoP
1	My uncle works for himself doing grocery store refrigeration. I moved to Denver around June 1st, and I'm looking for work. I worked with him **2** weeks ago last, for about a week and a half. I even went to Oklahoma City with him to help build a giant walk in cooler and set the cases in the store - the ones customers use.  He left for Modesto CA, 2 weeks ago to do another, and he gets back home tomorrow, and he may or may not have a paycheck waiting for me, but I will find out then.  I'll return the favor when I've been compensated, I appreciate the help! d:D  EDIT: A huge thank you to the incredible outofthewoods. d:D
0	Hello RAP, I am a student at UNT in Denton, TX and I would like some pizza please.
0	My sister is home from college break, and we're going to watch a movie together since we don't get to see each other very much. I'd be willing to trade an amateurish face removal in Photoshop for it (the higher res the picture, the better it'll be done).  I'll also send you examples of my face removals if you'd like. Imgur won't let me upload them from my phone. 
0	Dominos or Pizza Hut is fine. Tomorrow I'll be offering a pizza as well.  **EDIT:** I found [this on OzBargain](https://www.ozbargain.com.au/node/103013). I'm heading off to collect on it. Hopefully someone else finds that link useful too.
0	So yeah, poor kid just trying to get some food, no sob story here. And there is food at home, but it's just sweet stuff, like doritos and oreos. Well maybe there is a sob story. My ex gf left me after two years, and i've been trying to cope with this, but wasted all my money on liquor, and a massage(lol) after finding out she is seeing someone else already .. after two weeks. If anything would like to help, I appreciate it, i'm from New York City. I'll do anything. I just lurk btw, trees, leagueoflegends and depression.
0	Hey guys. I hate to ask for hep but Im kinda going through a rough time atm. I'm a single mom with an 8 year old autistic son named Logan. I've been struggling lately since I got laid off from my last job and we are literaly out of food now. I am starting a part time job tomorrow morning but it'll be 3 weeks before I'll receive my first paycheck and I'm currently awaiting results on my food stamp application. If anyone could please help us out with a pizza tonight it'd be a huge huge blessing, ty so much!
0	Hey guys, very keen on pizza for dinner, especially as I have no plan B. :D
0	So I quit smoking cigarettes today. Been doing fine but I'm really getting hungry and I'm a bit short on funds at the moment so thought I'd give this subreddit a try.
1	just found this subreddit and i want to participate so tell me what you would like me to do for a pizza, something thats realistic though. id like to forward this pizza too when i get paid next week, or become a part of a chain of forwarded pizzas
0	I am usually the one who gives, but unfortunately like so many others in this economy my family and I have fallen on hard times and would love the special treat of a pizza for dinner. We would be so greatful and appreciate it so very much. I was always taught to give back what God gives you and I would look forward to returning the favor when the clouds part and the sun shines upon us again. God Bless!
0	To make a long story short my Cat ran out of food today and I ran out and bought here a bag with my last few dollars. I figured I could tough it out intill Friday when I get paid but maybe someone out there is feeling generous. Not looking for anything Special and please don't feel sorry for me I do have some Peanut butter and jelly but thought I would give this a shot.
1	Hey all, I running a bit low on funds and food right now, after paying rent and bills, and I don't get paid until later in the week.  Been eating oatmeal the past couple days, but a pizza could really help me out!  UPDATE: No longer needed, got pizza'ed by /u/anthylorrel over in /r/RandomActsOfPizza
0	Random poem for a random pizza and a random day....      * At work so busy all day, No time to eat gotta run can't stay!   * On my way home tummy starts to grumble, as my engine starts to putter and rumble.  * Oh no I need gas I say to myself. Have to reach for the pizza money up on the top shelf.   * Not rich, nor poor. I walked into the house like every man through the front door.   * I sit and look at whats on my desk, load up a bowl and take a deep breath.   * After a hit I see in the corner a fresh new wrapped game.. Maybe a gift for a foreigner!!!!  * I log onto reddit and draw up a post, I decided a contest is what I should host.  * RandomActsOfGaming is where it has been layed. For 36 hours is where it will have stayed.  * Post completed happy with myself, A pizza is what I want I look to my shelf.  * Oh that's right I spent it on gas, and the rest of my money has to last.  * Oh well no worries what can you do, should not have got the extra super jumbo sized corn dog thing while high at the zoo. So random acts of pizza I turn to you  * I am not down on my luck or feeling blue. Others deserve it more then me this is true.   * But if you find it in your heart to warm mine up tonight, I will surely do the same on first paychecks light.  **Edit 1:** I am not selfish oh no I am not, little ceases pizza 5 dollars OH I FORGOT. I have scavenged for changed and less I have found! 5 dollars worth of stuff enough for the crown. So now I leave to go get one my self. With the gas I bought for my pizza money shelf.  Thanks everyone Please skip this RAOP as I have figured out a way to achieve my craving. As that's whats RAOP is all about.... That pizza craving!
1	Hey all.  My wife is away on business tonight, so it's just me an my daughter.  Well, had an unexpected bill come out of my checking account today putting me in the negative.  My little one has been begging me for pizza all morning.  We won't starve without it, but it'd be awesome if I could grab her a pie tonight.  I'll repay the kindness for sure.  
0	Hey y'all. First post so hoping for the best. Here's the rundown...  I lost my job about a month and a half ago right before my SO's birthday. I was bummed but kind of expecting it (cutbacks and such) and was able to score a few temp jobs here and there to keep my bank account stable, and seeing as my SO still had a full time job, we weren't terribly worried about the situation as a whole.   Fast forward 2 weeks: my SO gets fired out of the blue by the new GM at the newsroom where he worked. He's been really down and has not yet been able to find a job. We had just signed our new lease so all of our money had gone to that and our bills. There is not much I can do for him at this point, seeing as I've only been working 2 or 3 days a week tops.   Normally to cheer ourselves up we go all out on cheap pizza (Dominos, Hungry Howies, etc.), but with our lack of incoming funds, it's something that we haven't been able to do, and I think it would definitely lift his spirit a bit. If any of you wonderful redditors could help, I would be super appreciative. I don't have much of anything to barter with, but I am willing to send you a few pieces of record art that I have made if you would like something in return.   I know this whole thing probably sounds silly, but I need help getting him out of this funk and figure this is a great way to do it. Thanks for any help. 
0	Hi my cousin kellie told me about this website cause she had received a pizza for her and her son when they were in need.. well i'm going to be completely honest on how it all happened.. my friend took me to a party i drank a little much for myself and jumped off a hayloft in a barn into some card board boxes and snapped my fibula and tibia in half and had to have surgery with a medal rod and four screws in my leg. it happened on june 30th and i have been out of work ever since i work and at lions choice they are holding my job for me but i still have a good four months before i can return to work. i understand it was my stupidity that put me in this place and i am completely flat broke since ive been out of work if someone could help that would be awesome :)
0	My roommate and I live in Tucson, AZ. We had our last day ever today at the University of Arizona. We would like to celebrate with pizza, but both of us are pretty strapped for cash. Any help would be awesome! Stay classy Reddit!
0	I was working in the kitchen when I elbowed a steak knife that was on the edge of the counter (I didn't notice it, foolishly) and it fell onto my foot... Proof is in the a post to r/health on my page (this is a throwaway account).  I'd be grateful to anyone who could help me out with getting a pizza. I can't go to an ER until tomorrow (the only time I can get a ride to do so).   If further proof is needed I'll take another picture of my foot with a date and time card next to it. Thanks in advance to anyone with offers.  I understand that this is an odd post and I'm embarrassed about it, honestly, but I can't work in the kitchen to make top ramen tonight, hell, I haven't even cleaned up the mess on the floor yet. :/  Edit:Got to an ER. Still haven't eaten and can't walk. Would still love a pizza if anyone's willing.
0	Not gonna give you a very long sap story; just a poor college kid who would love an upturn of his day.  Thanks! 
1	Hi everyone. I've just seen my account after paying rent and don't have enough to buy anything. I'm finally on track with rent and bills after struggling to make ends meet for a while, but this leaves me without food until the next paycheck. Could really go for some pizza! I appreciate everyone who reads this, thanks to all RAOP subscribers. 
0	I'm a full time college student at the University of South Carolina. I've got lots of homework tonight and would love to get hooked up with a pie! 
0	I'm Scottish and obviously I love soup, but to me it's a lunch food. Eating the pasta for lunch was really poor planning by myself, so anyone willing to donate me a proper dinner would be a hero.
1	The cute young couple next door just had their first baby, and it would be wonderful if someone would please get them some food. I got them a few things for baby Sofi, but would greatly appreciate the kindness of pizza for the adults.  We are in Florida.  Thank you.
1	Hi there. ill be the first to admit, this is my first time in this subreddit. I only heard about you guys after watching the x-post on /videos but im glad i have.  I am not homeless, nor am i in serious need of a meal but i am a college student who is currently staying for the summer and taking summer classes to make sure i can get out of here as soon as possible because im unfortunately paying my way through school for now. Im lonely up here and all my friends and roommates are home for the summer so its just me up here. I recently split from my girlfriend so that isnt helping my situation. I do have a job but im only getting 10 hours a week (even for summer) so im super low on money right now and havent been able to eat out in weeks. I know most posts arent like this or maybe they are im kinda new to this community, but i would greatly appreciate a pizza, even a personal mini one. Anything at all would boost my spirits and hopefully get me out of this funk. Im here to stay and as soon as i can get enough money to buy myself a pizza ill return the favor and reward someone else in much greater need. Cheers!
0	Title is pretty much everything. From Michigan and just hungry for a pie. We dig all meats but not too big on greens, ya dig? Glory to whoever can give us something to munch on. Got my grandma and aunt around, so two pies wouldn't be half bad either, but beggars can't be choosers.
0	I was evicted from my home this past monday.. I spent all last week desperately searching for a place to live..  Since I'm disabled, and still waiting for my benefits to start, I knew I could never afford a place for myself.. So I did what most people in my situation would do.. I had faith that between my family and all my friends..  SomeONE.. (I thought there would be many)  would find it in their heart to take me in, even if for just a short time..  After waiting a few days, I realized that no one was going to come to my aid.. So I decided to start asking those who I KNEW would do anything for me.. Or so I thought.. Immediate family turned me away without even a 2nd thought.. Since they were the only ones in my family that had room for me, I had to move on to my good friends.. My best friend lives 4 hours away so that just wasn't an option.. My other best friend AND neighbor would definitely take me in.. I just knew she would!!  She has an empty guest bedroom and everything.. So I asked if she could help me out and let me stay in the guest room for no longer than a month.. Without even pretending to think about it.. She said "I don't have any room for you".. That was it.. I had exhausted all my options.. One day before my eviction I started to plan the best way to be homeless.. I decided to live in my van.... Scary doesn't come close to how I felt, but my fear was deep.... Ring Ring! It's Curtis.. A friend I met thru my best friend.. I knew him and considered him a friend but we didn't know each other very well.. Without hesitation he said that he heard about my situation and wanted to offer me a place on his couch..  I burst into tears.. I was relieved.. But mostly, I was so touched to receive such extreme generosity from someone who is also struggling just as hard as I am!  So here we are at his 1 bedroom apartment.. Trying to figure out how we are going to afford something to eat TONIGHT.. Let alone tomorrow.. But It's 6:52pm and neither of us have eaten today.. I want Curtis to have this pizza cause he deserves it!  Thanks for reading! :)
1	Hello fellow humans, another sad story is the last thing i want to put on here or read. Me and my daughter samantha are hungry, we just moved out of state and got into a new aptmartment. We have no food or money until tomorow morning when i can cash my check. i would be willing to work for the pizza if there is anything i can do online. Im not rich but will pay it forward if there is anyone willing to help. Thank you :) Sally May 
1	So, I just recently graduated from a business college and earned a diploma to work in an office for admin. I was lucky and got a job right out of school. I had to commute to work and a week in my car died, so I went to a dealership to finance one since I didn't have any money saved. Yesterday I just got let go of my job. I posted about it in r/jobs here: http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1kyxcc/i_got_fired_today_out_of_the_blue/ to gain some sort of advice/motivation. Well my new car has been having troubles and I finally had the time to take it in. Well my piece of shit extended warranty doesn't cover any of the things wrong with it and it's going to cost me 2500 like i have that lying around. So if there's any kinda strangers who can help a sista out with a pizza that would be great. I want pizza is kinda code when I'm just super sad. Since I have Celiac Disease and eating pizza is a treat for me now even though there's more options for us people who can't have gluten. Anywho, if there's any kind soul who can afford a pizza that'd be cool. but even a joke or uplifting advice would be cool too. Thanks. And I hope one day I can return the favour. I live in SK Canada by the way.
0	Happy Veterans Day! I'd like to make a request that someone out there make Ramen illegal. My family and I have eaten nothing but ramen for a week and it has slowly but surely drained everyone in my household. We try dressing it up with canned sauce, but it's still really bad. Can you help a brotha out with something that doesn't taste like wet cardboard tonight? My wife, kids, and myself would appreciate the kind gesture. My kids can also make you a you tube video if you like laughing at silly things. Nothing too graphic or obscene (they're 10 and 12), but I'm sure they can make you a funny video of just about whatever you like within reason. (Daddy has to approve of the theme.)  If you can't help, thank you for checking out my post. I was joking about ramen being a crime - We are thankful to have it, but wish we could have something different. Thank you and hope ya'll enjoy your Friday. 
0	I'm in emotional need.  But today I lost my best friend.   My friend since fourth grade was bullied out of school in 6th, and nobody talked to him. I felt bad for him, and I stuck with him. Several years go by, and I'm still his only friend, so I convince him to come to my school, and meet my friends! So school starts, and he meets my friends, he doesn't really click with them, and decides to meet new people. A month go by, and he meets some really bad kids. Stupid kids no one else likes. Any way, I try and talk to him today, and he gives me a cold shoulder.   When I tell him what he did wasn't cool (being an awkward homeschooler he doesn't know much about being with people), he apologizes. The bell rings, we go to class. After class him and his buddy come up to me, punch me, and run off.   This puts me in a bad mood. I storm home. He texts "What's wrong?" I tell him "You, punching me." He then, goes on about how I'm over reacting, because I'm upset, he punched me, and I tell him to go away, not wanting to talk, and he just refuses to believe he did anything wrong.  He then argues, that "I should just suck it up, it's your fault you're in pain, if you weren't so weak, it wouldn't have hurt!"  I then at that very moment, lose it, sh*t hits the fan. I tell him "Screw off. We're not friends. I don't wanna be associated with a person who believe they're not ever at fault." I haven't talk to him since. This was a few hours ago. So I'm just lost. He's one of the few people I had left.   I'd just like a Pizza to cheer me up. 
0	I don't like asking others for help, but it's been 2 days and I'm so very hungry. I had no choice but to ask.  I would really appreciate anything anyone can do to help, and I will happily pay it forward once I get paid in the next couple of days. I will also make sure to post a big, fat Thank You post to whomever does me this great kindness.  Thanks!  EDIT: roommate came through! No longer needed. Thx!
0	My husband is the best husband, father, and friend I could possibly ask for.  In addition to his full time job, he also works a part time job so that we can make ends meet, but we hardly have anything left for anything extra.  For our anniversary today, we made each other gifts and I wanted to make him a nice dinner, but we recently had to drain our bank accounts to pay for an (unexpected) car repair. I would really like to do something extra nice for him.  Can someone please help me make this happen?
0	If you want the sob story, just ask, but at this point I don't need to burden you. But I finally feel a bit better and all I have for the rest of the week is cereal and rice, which I don't really mind because fried rice is quite excellent, but that's not the point. I'm could really use some pizza is all.
0	College student with a fixed income here. Payed the utilities, bought gas, and now have nothing left till friday payday but a couple dollars. I've eaten enough Ramen and Chef Boyardee to last a lifetime, I would love a delicious pizza.  I've given before,  http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPizza/comments/jrcoj/thank_you_theunrepentlurker/  and will do so again when I have the money, right now I just really want a hot meal that doesn't tasted like crunchy salt...  Thanks   
0	Just got home off of a long ass drive from Fountain, Michigan back home to Racine, Wisconsin all in one run. Too tired to make dinner but I can offer you a pretty sweet picture of the sunrise on Lake Michigan http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/215431_10152018722100414_1224859864_n.jpg
0	I lost my job a few weeks ago and also just ended a very bad engagement. I am a single mom with 3 kids and we really would like pizza but I have no money until my unemployment starts. If anyone could help us out it would be great.
1	I've got two exams tomorrow and only tapioca pudding in the house.  I'm stuck at my desk writing out op-amp circuits trying to make sense of it all.  I'm craving a pizza hardcore.  Help a lady out?  I definitely will be paying it back when I am not stressed out of my mind!      Edit: crappy webcam proof of [starving clueless college girl](http://i.imgur.com/IsFpk.jpg).    EDIT: IT'S BEEN DONE.  CHECK OUT MY THANK YOU TO THE AMAZING ithinkimdoingthis [HERE](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/pfsut/thank_you_sooooo_much_ithinkimdoingthis_i_know/)!
0	This is my first time using this subreddit. I don't have an elaborate sob story, but I can say that payday is Friday and i will gladly return the favor. O:-)   I don't exactly know how this works, so please be patient with me as I learn. :-)
0	Thank you for your consideration. :)
0	Struggling financially...I work as a line cook and our hours get hacked in the summer time.  I get paid on Monday and have cereal to get me through, so I'm not gonna starve :) but if anyone would like to help, that would be amazing.  And I'd love to pay it forward when I get paid.  I don't like the thought requesting if you aren't also willing to help someone else.  
0	What's up ROAP? Two twenty-something dudes from NH and MA trying to get down on some pizza tonight and watch a movie or two, but we're both dead broke from rent and car payments :( A Random Act of Pizza would be HEAVENLY! 
1	We began a nonstop video game party Friday night. Somehow we managed to eat all of our snacks in one night, leaving us stranded in our dorms with no food. Our campus cafeteria is closed for the weekend, and we don't even have ramen. Please help us? :-(   Here is a picture for your trouble http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-saYh5WfGHOY/TZLo1uV04PI/AAAAAAAAADE/8w2gLMIqPWE/s1600/puppy_eyes-2.jpg
0	Ok so I'm a mom of three got paid today but my bank is holding the check for some reason. Out of food completely in my house.: -\  was really hoping to get a pizza or two will return the favor as soon as I'm able to touch the money in my bank. 
0	Haven't been paid in 5 weeks, will be paid next week and can buy a pizza for someone then. Can explain more if I need to but I just feel like eating something other than rice and pasta.  Thanks
0	I'm currently sitting at a McDonalds, where I slept in my truck last night, with no gas and no money for food. I didn't get anything to eat yesterday, and so far today it's looking like it's gonna be the same way. There is a Pizza Hut within walking distance, and would really appreciate any kind of food. It really sucks to have to ask for something like this, but it's either this or go outside and beg for money face to face.
0	my family of 6 could really use a hot meal 2nite, i am sorry if this post has repeated, i am 2 this, still figuriing it out. i will gladly pay it forward 2morrow 4 any help 2day. please help. 
1	My boss was supposed to pay me on Friday, asked if I could wait until Saturday. Haven't seen him all weekend, and this has seriously demonified my situation. Could use a 'za for the night. Will pay it forward next week!  Despite the remote location, we have Domino's, Pizza Hut and Boston Pizza. Order take out - I'm nearby all of them and I can save you delivery.  Thanks!
0	Hi, Reddit. So I'm broke as hell until my first work paycheck comes in and my fridge is pretty bare. I was randoming through subreddits and came across RAOP once again. Are you guys really this awesome?
1	I think I could make a pizza last until friday, if anyone would like to help out a random college student I would really, really appreciate it.
1	Check clears in my bank account on Monday. Someone, please help one hungry dude get some calories for today?
1	This is my first time requesting, I'm a full-time nursing student only able to work part-time. I'm not going to make this a sob story, I get paid tomorrow, but all I have left to eat tonight is some chili so I would really appreciate a pizza! I love RAoP and hope to contribute very soon as well =)
0	I am in Lubbock TX.  Anyone willing to help a guy out?  I will repay the kindness this week
0	Hey people well yea i was with my ex one night and to be honest she kinda sorta little bit raped me. I know, how can a guy get raped? WELL IT HAPPEN K! And after two months of waiting, mother nature answered my prayers! I would really like to celebrate this and I've never gotten a pizza through this before, but I promise if I receive a pizza I will give someone a pizza in the future as well! Thanks everyone! If i do miraculously get chosen I shall pm my details.  [Bill Murray demonstrating how I feel](http://imgur.com/V2NRn)  edit: just found out though i have to work tomorrow from 12 to 1 am...... yay... 
1	Not sure why it's Pizza Hut in particular, but this craving has been driving me insane for the past two weeks.  And unfortunately I got into a small accident last weekend, so any money I come across has to go toward repairing my car.  If some kind soul could bless me with a large pizza or send me a Pizza Hut gift card I will return the favor as soon as I can, either to the donator or to someone else in need (their choice).  I'm having bloodwork done tomorrow in the same town with the Pizza Hut, so I can pick it up then!  That would make my week.  Possibly my month, since the whole car thing was quite shitty.  Edit: Crap I forgot to mention in the title, I'm in New Hampshire!  **UPDATE:** I was able to use afshin's gift card and had enough to get both a large stuffed crust pizza AND cinnamon sticks!  Here I am post pizza pick-up.  http://i.imgur.com/pyUuc.png  I couldn't wait and started eating in the parking lot haha.  Once LHtheXF's gift card shows up I will donate it to another redditor. :)  Thanks again you guys are amazing!
1	So I made this throwaway because I just feel bad about having to post here, but it's a last resort.  I've been unemployed for a few months and my cash is just winding low.  I'm in the midst of classes that have been taking up my time and preventing me from finding a new job and I'm starting to really stress out about having to pay rent in ~10 days.  I'm not expecting anything, but I figured I'd try for a pizza.  I have a verification code.
0	I am an older college student that is broke for another week.  I do have food options in my fridge but it has been forever since I had a delivery pizza.  I am not picky about the chain or toppings (except anchovies, yuck).  I would love just a multi-topping pizza of any size or crust and possibly soda to go with.
0	This is my first time doing this but I could really use a pizza tonight. I am broke till friday and I will be living on spaghetti and ramen until then. Please help me with some delicious pizza. I promise I will pay it forward come pay day friday!!
1	So, I overdrew my account paying rent, and then I got the overdraft fee. So I'm like doubly overdrawn. I have training for a job on Saturday but like, payday won't be till Thursday. I have one thing of easy mac left in the cabinet, maybe some pasta, but man, I am so stressed out. Hook a stupid kid up with a cheese pizza? Would totally rock my weekend. If you wanted to go crazy, barbecue chicken pizza, but hey a large cheese pizza would feed me for a while, like 4 meals. I'm batting my eyelashes here. Thanks for hearing me out. 
0	I'm just hanging out with my sibling, bored as hell, nothing too interesting here but god I would suck a thousand dicks for a buffalo chicken pizza.  If anybody replies to this: There is a heaven for penises and I will take you there.
1	So here's the story, my friend and I share a house with another fellow and said other fellow is the leaseholder. He was very gung ho about re-signing and even asked us if we would like to continue staying so we naturally said yes, and this was about two months ago when he asked. Fast forward to today, we get the re-sign papers and then he decides he doesn't want to re-sign, well that's all fine and dandy if he doesn't want to re-sign but the lease is up on the 31st of this month, kind of messed up to decide that with 12 days remaining. So now we're in a bind and a pizza would really brighten up our night. Thanks for reading guys, and may your narwhals bacon forevermore.
0	My wife was layed off 6 months ago. I do side jobs and it's been hard to find work. With 4 children ages 10, 8, 5, 4 it has been really hard trying to make ends meet. I can't remember the last time we had pizza.  Pizza would be a real blessing. Thanks for reading.
0	wallets empty, plus finals and wrapping up the final week at my internship...i would really appreciate a nice fresh steaming triangle of cheese at this moment in time.  cheers  
1	after couch surfing for months, going through job loss and rejections, bank trouble, college loans, unreliable friends, my girlfriend and I finally got enough money to pay for a lease on an apartment. I just spent the last 2 days both studying for the biggest final of my life and lugging furniture up three flights of stairs until two in the morning. I just took my exam and i nailed it thank god, however i don't have any money for lunch for the next week. i was hoping that someone would be kind enough to get one for me..this has been a 6 month struggle that has finally come together.
0	I'm posting from a throwaway. Let me give you a run through of my typical day: I wake up, take a shower/get dressed, and head to hell. I work in a call center in a little cubicle where my only joy is seeing the clock hit 7pm. I sit in a chair and get yelled at for 8 hours. Sometimes 16 hours, because my boss likes to tell me that his star agent has taken off and he needs me to cover their shift. This rockstar agent also likes to come in late and is related to the head manager so..why would I complain about him? Who would I complain to? He's a pain in my ass always asking me questions that he should know the answer to.   My other co-workers are really good people and by good I mean aholes. One guy plays erotic games most of his shift on the company computer and no one seems to care. Another lady is a busy body Christian looking to convert everyone and anyone she can find. If she spent more time working versus running around telling everyone to have a blessed day, she'd get more accomplished. The other co-workers pretty much annoy the living shit out of me. They call me and ask for answers or blind transfer callers to me.   I know I need out of this job and I complain way more than I should. I should be happy I have a job. I should be happy I can barely afford my bills. Right right? Wrong! I've been looking everywhere else for work, but not many places are hiring near me. I'm so depressed with everything. My only motivation to go into work is for the check.  I'm hoping someone who has worked in customer service hell knows my pain and would be willing to treat me to some cheesy noms tonight. I will **absolutely** pizza it forward on pay day. I'm willing to provide a copy of my paystub and will send you a message from my main account if needed. I am really a broken man and I have completely lost my faith in everyone.   Thank you for reading and I'm sorry this was too long winded.
1	Not having a great time during my first day on reddit, or a great birthday.  A pizza probably wouldn't help, but I could use a pick me up. location: University of Michigan.  received: from tanyagal2
0	I preemptively realize that this post is at a severe risk of sounding like a pity party, but I want to make it clear that I am not trying to create a sob story here. But, I also want to be honest. Know that I am happy (pizza or not)! With that disclaimer out of the way, here is sort of what is happening in my life, cliff-note style.  -I am poor in the college-student sort of way. My parents are broke, so I worked my way through college working for AT&amp;T 40 hours a week.  -I did well in college  -Upon graduating, I received a US government grant to move to Taiwan for a year.  -Yay!  -However, there was a six month gap between college and moving to Taiwan, one that was really hard to fill with employment. So, we are pretty broke.  -The last few weeks of my life have been insane. Applying for visas, passports, getting medical clearances, seeing every doctor in town, selling my car, buying a new wardrobe, packing or selling everything I own... you get the idea. My GF and I have been waking up, scrambling all day, and going back to bed. We are exhausted and broke.  -I am leaving to Taiwan in 4 days, and I still have so much to do that it's quite upsetting.  -From what I understand, the pizza situation in Taiwan is quite depressing :(  So, I ask for some help for my GF and I, one last chance to eat some pizza before we move on into the unknown (and one less thing to have to figure out tonight as we continue packing).  I had always read about this sub-reddit, but never participated. I always figured that if I did, I would be giving away a pizza. But, at the moment, it seems life put me in the position of the requester.  Pizza or not, I think this is a really cool subreddit, and I am super excited to be moving abroad, despite all the stress involved with preparing.  Thanks for listening, and I can't wait until I am in a position to be the pizza giver.  EDIT: Sorry, I am in the Atlanta, GA area. I just re-read the info site and noticed I missed this bit. 
0	None of us have money for a pizza and we are no where near one of our houses to get any food. Somebody suggested trying to see if we can get anything.
0	I haven't worked in weeks and unemployment is taking forever to go through. I ran out of stuff to sell, owe 2 different friends a lot of money, and am in desperate need of food. I rode a bus and walked the rest of the way to a local food bank, they said I needed an appointment. Called to make one, they aren't taking appointments right now, WTF.  So a little while ago I dialed 211 and tried the United Way, they helped my mom a lot when I was little. She got abuse counseling, food, clothes, utilities, everything practically free from them. I told them straight up, I ain't got a car, their exact words were none of my local banks deliver, thanks for calling, click. I called back three times and every time they keep sending me to the same place that already told me no.  Reddit you're my last hope. I saw the story a few months back, didn't need it then but I need it now. When United Way gives you the shaft you know it's bad. If I gotta walk five miles to get it I'll do it, I don't need the exercise but I need food. I feel like I've been walking the desert for a minute and ten hours. Hope there's some love flowing through here today for me. Peace.   Forgot to mention I'm in Jacksonville, Florida.
0	I just barley made my rent this month with literally the last cent from an old coin jar I had. I'm greatly relieved, yet oddly depressed looking at my now empty coin jar.   Is anyone willing to help cheer up a broke redditor with some pizza while I figure what my next step is to be? In any case, thank goodness for the power of the penny and thanks for reading!  To Mods: Thanks for posting a link /r/Food_Pantry in the sidebar. Never knew about that! Might be a lifesaver this month! :D  Edit:Grammar and comma
1	Hey there RAoP. Rae here. Longtime lurker, first time poster. I moved to New York State about a month ago, and have been on the job hunt since like, day one. Now, I've finally managed to get myself a job, but it doesn't start until next thursday, and I've got just enough money left in my account for laundry and my phone bill, so until then I'm bumming off of my roommates for food, which I have been for the last two weeks.  There are a whole mess of really great Pizza places within walking distance of my apartment, and I'd really like to get a pie to share with my roommates, as thanks for putting me up for so long.
0	Hi, all.  I hope someone understands.  [Proof of unemployment.](http://i.imgur.com/06T2w.jpg?1)  You don't need to do this, but I'd appreciate it. (Plus, I can surprise the fianceé with her half to lessen the blow.  She knows, incidentally.)  Sorry to bother.  **Edit** ... Sorry again. I'm in Ontario, Canada. I'm new to this. Sorry.  **UPDATE**  I didn't get pizza last night. User "shockey" helped out (I believe, because my faith in humanity can't let me think that this was a prank) to the point of taking my personal info, but no pizza came.  Around 11pm last night, I noticed that they deleted their user info from Reddit, but tried to ignore the warning flags that come with that.  [Conversation, part 1](http://imgur.com/QkDp5.jpg) and [part 2.](http://imgur.com/ktmYJ.jpg)  Sorry, everyone, for getting your hopes up. I don't know what my fianceé ate last night. It's nearly 5am for me now, so I'll go eat some cereal and make a coffee, and start the day. ~~I'll message the mods here about this~~ (Nope, I have no info and it was only my trust), but only time will tell if we were scammed or not. I hope not.  I sincerely think that it was a first-time gesture that didn't go through.  I really don't mean to bother anyone, and thanks for the words and support you gave.   **UPDATE 2** Hello, again. Thanks to everyone who messaged their support and well-wishes.  Although we never received pizza from *Random Acts of Pizza*, which has an obstacle regarding cross-border exchanges it seems, it should be noted that *we did have pizza* last night from some old friends of ours who invited us back to our hometown.  It was a great night out and all of us got some great laughs and good social vibes.  *(The first* "boy pizza" *had pepperoni, bacon, tomato, and red pepper; the second* "girl pizza" *was feta cheese, sundried tomato, red onion, and green olives.  There was also 20 deep-fried wings, ordered with BBQ sauce but supplemented with the home's own Frank Sauce. A jug of Nestle Ice Tea Zero was offered and shared all around.)*  I just want to thank everyone who has offered to assist my fianceé and I in the last few days. She's as astounded and overjoyed at this post as I am, and we thank you all sincerely.  She also keeps nudging me to start accepting some of the gratuity, Since I was fence-sitting because of my morality, ethics, and humility, I've decided to graciously accept a few offers (if still available) via private message. If declined, I fully understand with no ill will.  Once again, thank you, everyone.  You are an awesome community, and we love you.  **TL;DR** Laid off, pizza offer fell through in possible scam (though hopefully not), Reddit comes through with offers and consolation, we get pizza from friends back home.  [Here's a pic...](http://mfrost.typepad.com/cute_overload/images/bunny.jpg)  [...from the cutest images ever. Thank you.](http://thecutest.info/top.html)  **UPDATE 3** Five months later, and I got a low-wage job doing satellite installation. It's something. Thanks for your kindnesses, reddit.
1	Hey guys. Title pretty much says it all. I was supposed to get paid today (1st and 3rd Friday) but my anal retentive senior Asian boss says he doesn't have to pay me till Monday (closed Sunday).  I'm not starving to death right now or anything but I could really use some food for the sake of work tomorrow. If not thanks a lot for what everyone does anyway. I'll pizza it forward as soon as I can either way.   PM for my info if you can. (U.S.)  *edit* forgot to mention had to put my jingles into my gas tank today to get to work. Hence the brokeness.
0	Hey RAOP. I never thought I'd be here posting. But my week has been terrible. I don't want any sympathy so I will try to keep it sweet and short.  I got laid off Friday, and I'm going to go apply for unemployment until I get back on my feet. I plan on stopping by the pantry Wednesday (next day they are open). I thought the pantry was open today but they are not. I have a 3 year old and that is the only reason why I am posting.  I know posting from a throwaway is frowned upon, but I truly cannot work up enough nerve to reveal my identity. However if someone is willing to help I can give my picture ID, my active accounts name or anything else that's requested. 
1	My wife and I just started back working in the schools.  We are a bit low on funds from having summer break and not getting paid.  Want to celebrate our first week back with style.  Nothing says style like cheesy goodness.  
0	I am actually in no longer commissioner, but now a broke college study whose last final is tomorrow.  I could really use a good pizza right now as all my money has gone to putting a down payment on a house and tuition for next semester. Life's a garden, dig it.  
0	August 18th is my bday and I love pizza, however it is really expensive, and me not having a job, can't afford it! so hopefully one of you guys out there are willing to send me a pizza! message me!
0	Life has been really tough for us over the past few months.  I finally finalized my divorce to my ex, who turned into an abusive alcoholic nightmare towards the end, and I couldn't be happier I'm away from him now.  I had a decent job as a nurse, but I was caught up in the downsizing at the hospital, and have been looking for a job for the past few months, without much luck.    I haven't really been able to spoil my girls with anything in a long time, let alone a pizza, and I would be incredibly humbled and gracious if someone would be willing to help us out.  This is an amazing community, and I hope to be able to come back here soon on the other side, being able to give away some pizzas.  Thanks everyone 
1	(Tennessee USA) It is a day to celebrate after all! We just can't afford to dine. If anyone feels the need to give we would appreciate it! Even if you don't we both hope you have a fantastic Pi Day!  *edit for the state
0	I'm excited for leaving school, and I feel like a way to celebrate. eing a high school student, I haven't got a job, otherwise I'd go out and buy ingredients for pasta.  (Y'know, come to think of it, I know the whole notion of "going into the big wide world" and "pizza delivered right to your door" is a big oxymoron :P )  I've never done a RAOP before, so I'm not sure if countries matter. I'm in Australia (New South Wales, Sydney, to be exact).  I'm a big believer in "do good, get good" and "giving &gt; recieving", so I'll return the favour to a random redditor next week once I scrap up some change! 
0	I'm having some friends over to my new place for a movie night and I have very little food to feed them with, and even less money to buy food/snacks. I love being a good host but it's been harder lately while I wait for work to pick up. Any help would be great thanks in advance!  I realize this isn't the most dire need of pizza. But it would be a great welcome to this community and I'd love to pay it forward in the future. I also got left in the dark with redditgifts on the last exchange so it'd be nice to have SOMETHING given to me.  EDIT: More begging
0	Single mom in central Pennsylvania looking for some help. I only have enough food in the house for my children. I don't have any money right now. I always make sure they have what they need, even if I have to go without. I am getting grocery money on Friday. I would really appreciate a pizza to help lift my spirits. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
0	Currently home on leave for a few days with my kid, I'm currently in a money situation until the 1st. Trying to see if I could get a little help till then to put a smile on my daughters face. It will be greatly appreciated.
0	I'm 34 weeks pregnant, and just got put on bedrest.  Because we weren't anticipating this, I have no meals prepared.  My husband is at work, so if someone could hook me up with some pizza, I would really appreciate it!  We'll definitely give back to the RAOP crew within the next week.  I'm just looking for some nourishment tonight.
1	We have no running air conditioner and the thought of having to turn the oven on turns my stomach. We don't have much to eat our food stamps don't come in for a few more days. If anyone could send us a pizza i would be very grateful. Thank you. God Bless!  Roxanne and Lilly
0	Fridge is empty (aside from useless condiments, cheese, salsa... and milk).  A pizza would be much appreciated. :)  **Edit:** Location: MN.
0	I'll be honest, I'm not going to starve without it. However, I'm trying to power through and get a bunch of A.P. homework done and could really go for some pizza.  Location: Southern Oregon.    Papa John's is the only one that will deliver.  I don't have enough gas to go pick one up.  EDIT: No longer needed. 
1	Upstate SC, she would really appreciate the gift and it would save her time from cooking! thank you RAOP!  EDIT: Thank you jimwll, you are a true hero to the people!
1	I have one dollar in my bank account, and things have been pretty rough financially.  Honestly, it's really hard for me to ask a random stranger to buy me a pizza, but my stomach sounds like a civil war right now and I'm starving.
0	I'm 24, live in Missouri, and could really use some food with sustenance. I'm between jobs and living with a friend who is paying for the rent and bills until I can find work. Any kindness would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!
1	Hey I just moved here to Sacramento starting a new job. I was supposed to get my paycheck last week but the damn thing must have gotten lost in the mail because there is no sign of it yet (not at old address either). Reaaaally hopin it would show up today since I've been without food since yesterday. Anyway, I fully plan on reciprocating once I get paid so It's more like a pizza loan. I don't know really too many people yet here in this town so I'm coming to you guys. Cheers!
0	In between paychecks. Would be awesome to eat Dinner, Lunch, or Breakfast once this week. If you're in the giving mood PM me or comment. DFW area. All and any help appreciated. I plan on returning the favor the second I get my paycheck and will post proof.   Again Thanks all. I'd just like to say this subreddit is beyond awesome, and thank you to anyone and everyone who has been so kind.
1	My wife and I are filing for bankruptcy very soon.  In the meantime, we are very close to running out of food, and we are out of money until I get paid next Friday.  We're not pigs - we can easily make a pizza last for two dinners between the two of us.  It would get us that much closer to my next paycheck without starving.  We would really, really appreciate a pizza from some kind Redditor right about now.  I can provide verification if needed.  Thanks for reading!  Location: Northern NJ
1	Long story short, my friend put his dick in crazy and decided to drop me as a friend due to her jealousy of me (another female). I'm in between jobs, not starting my new one for a while. I would love to simultaneously comfort myself over the loss of a friend and celebrate my (eventual) new job with a good pizza, but I can't. Hugs for life if someone actually does this for me! 
0	(Northern Colorado)  So here's my dilemma guys... My payroll made a mistake on Friday and it was too late to take care of before the next business day (fingers are crossed for tomorrow). The problem is that I literally live paycheck to paycheck a few day late check can really turn your world upside down. I'm starving for a bite to eat tonight and would be so grateful if someone could help me out. After I get my paycheck sorted out I'd be happy to pay it forward or just send a pizza back at you in appreciation. Whatever you want me to do to return the favor, just, please help.  Thanks Redditors,   /u/shaboingdezzleknock
0	My husand is working late tonight and me and my wee one would love some pizza.  And my bank account onlyhas enough for rent :(  Thanks in advance and God bless.
0	Hey all. I am sick at home and the only thing I'm craving is pizza. No transportation and broke on top of that. Will anyone help out? Thanks!   ETA: Will provide verification code
1	I came across Reddit a few days ago and I hope that someone out there can help me surprise my family. My wife and I ended up losing our jobs, and things have been pretty hard for us. Last night I went without eating so that my children could eat. As a man, I feel like I'm failing my family and I'd like to give them a meal that isn't "instant". If anyone can make this happen, I will borrow my neighbors camera and make a video for you. Everyone will be home today at 5:00 PM EST. We are in Plainfield, New Jersey.
0	I've been on reddit for awhile and have been mostly a lurker. I saw random acts of pizza and figured I'd give it a try. I'm a firm believer in paying it forward and would do so if this goes through. However, if I get dejected I will still offer a free pizza to others in the future. =)   I'm moving on September 13th and this is one of the last times I get to hang with my friends before I have to go. No sob story here, just thought I'd give it a try. ^^
0	Hurry before this baby pops.    Any drawing requests are subject to evaluation before approval.  I'm pretty disgusting and immature so it will be hard to suggest something that I would disapprove of.    Warning: I am not a good artist but I will try my bestest.
0	and ate all of mine and my girlfriends plates. Please send a pizza to help!  http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20090215074230/friends/images/8/8d/9x08-ChandlerBreaksPlates.jpg
0	Never been pizza'd before or fulfilled requests, but I figured I would give this a shot. No big deal if this doesn't work, just thought it would be cool to say Reddit bought her a Pizza!
0	Hi Reddit,  Before you all jump on me for being a new member, I hope you will take the chance to read my plea.  Yes, I'm new to the community, no I didn't hear about it through the news reports the other day, but rather heard about it from a family friend.    In the past month, my life has essentially fallen apart.  My wife of 15 years has all but thrown in the towel to our marriage.  She has moved back in with her parents, and I'm living in our house with our two children, Jennifer &amp; William.  Along with this added stress, I've just lost my job as a management consultant.  So now I'm left with a broken heart, a hole in my pocket and two hungry kids to feed.  We're not in as terrible of a position as other members on here, but I was wondering if a kind member would be willing to donate a pizza so I can surprise my kids at some point, and hopefully help them get their minds off our current situation.   Thank you all so much for even reading this.
0	Please, if anyone can spare like $10/$15 for one pizza it would be amazing. I don't know when I will be buying groceries next. Maybe Friday coming up. 
0	So last night I lost my debit card, but I had to cancel it because what ever money I have is on that checking account.So with no money or access to money, until my bank opens, I couldn't even take the bus this morning. Luckily I had my bike so I could ride to my over-the-weekend tutoring job at my college...it took 2 hours. So yeah, I've been here on campus for a few hours now and I still have 4 more hours to go. I'm starving, I keep eating the free lollipops we hand out to students and drinking water to settle my stomach. If anyone out there would would help me I promise to return the favor. I work at Bellevue College, WA
0	My bills this month stretched me a bit thin because I had to get some stuff on my car fixed up. My next payday isn't till Tuesday, so I have been getting really "Creative" with my basic ingredients I have left (corn and chicken broth macaroni noodle soup anyone?). I would love for someone to get me a Pizza. I'm not picky. Just something with Pepperoni. I will pay it all kinds of forward on Tuesday. And until then, I will write my champion a Poem dedicated to thier awesomeness.
0	I hope I did everything right. My deal is no better or worse than most people here. I live in a decent place with a room mate, both jobless at the moment and going to school. Both on food stamps. I have a 2 1/2 year old daughter that most of my EBT goes to, which is fine. Problem is both of our cards are empty but mine gets refilled in a week. I have exactly one cup of noodles left, half a bag of pork rhines, a full jug of apple juice and possibly 3 sandwiches worth of bread for peanut butter and jelly. Honestly, we don't eat much. If one of you was so kind as to offer even one pizza, it would be very appreciated. I'll take a picture, thank you, anything. Thanks for considering.
1	Me and my friend are stuck at my house with nothing to eat and no money. we have no car and some ball searing heat outside here in Las Vegas. help a couple of bros out. Thanks guys.  EDIT: Request filled thanks to [notbumble](http://www.reddit.com/user/notbumble)'s baller ass self.
0	I've never done this before, sorry if I'm breaking some rules, though I'm pretty sure I got it all correct.  My 3 year old daughter never really asks for specific meals, so I was surprised that she asked for pizza this morning. I've already done our shopping, and I don't have the supplies to make any, and our food budget is depleted.    Anyone out there feel like making a family's night? We're a family of four, though the little one is only 16 months old, so he doesn't eat THAT much :-)  Got a verification code if that is required.   Thanks a ton for reading!  Edit: Fulfilled! Thanks to /u/DiscontentedFairy!
1	My dad has been battling problems both with money and with alcoholism, and when I tried to mention it to him, he misconstrued it and went somewhat berserk. I left home the next day (yesterday) and returned to Chicago several days before the dorms reopen. One of my friends was gracious enough to let me stay in her apartment, but I feel really guilty about both using her utilities and stealing her food.  I was just wondering if anyone would be kind enough to lend me a pizza that I can spread out over the next couple days. I went job hunting today and plan to spend the rest of the evening filling out applications, so I promise that I will return the favor as soon as I have enough money. Thank you!
0	My friend on facebook told me about this site. Single mom here...we are currently going through some hard times. We have canned goods, ramen, bread and such but nothing really good and feeling until I get foodstamps thursday. The kids and me would appreciate some pizza tonight if possible. Located in NC.
0	So I've been studying for a test all morning and FINALLY felt confident that I was going to get a good grade. So I get in my car to drive to class, get onto the highway, start going about 60MPH...and my front tire pops.   I honestly do not know how I didn't get in an accident. It was really terrifying. So, now all of my money will be going towards buying new tires. I also missed my test :(   I hate having a sob story but I would seriously love some pizza to celebrate not being injured/dead. Thanks for reading! 
0	Am I FLUSH with luck to get a pizza STRAIGHT from a complete stranger? My gratitude would be ACE HIGH...okay that one was forced
1	HI I am in louisville ky and my daughter will be home soon from school and she has been wanting pizza and right now I am broke until I get paid  next week..can anyone please send us some pizza please ..
0	Hello Redditors, my roommates and I are broke literally until Thanksgiving. What little money we have is currently being pooled to get back home for Thanksgiving break and see our families and such. Something we don't really get to do often. A little bit about us? I am a musician/student studying Telecom. My roommate is also studying Telecom/intern at local, and our third roommate is simply put a true American. Help us advance our studies by filling our stomachs!  Also by studying I may or may not mean playing Skyrim all day. Oh yeah we reside Bloomington,IN aka IU EDIT: still playing Skyrim still hungry. I need my daily vegetable intake.
0	My husband and I will be celebrating our 9th anniversary tomorrow. Unfortunately we do not have any money to actually do something or go anywhere but we will enjoy each others company probably watching some tv and just relaxing.  I would love to surprise hubby with a pizza from anywhere in the area, he is not picky and this would make a great anniversary present.  If anyone could help me out I would so appreciate it.  Eventually when we get back on our feet I would pay it forward!
0	Barely made it on time to work today, hit the off button on the alarm. So I can usually make it through the day without lunch if I had breakfast but I didn't get to munch on that either. 
0	Hey folks,   I've been in a nasty evaluation process for about a month, it's coming to an end soon, and it's looking like I may be out of a job by Christmas.  A pizza would sure brighten my day, and if I do wind up keeping my job, I'll be sure to pay it forward.
0	Don't feel like eating another box of kraft mac n' cheese made with gross half and half. May not be in as bad need as some people, but I've had a crap week. 
0	Hi guys. Situation as following: Im gonna get a surgery tomorrow, and 2 days after that get chemotherapy. I want to eat my favourite pizza once more before going to hospital, because the food there is just awful, and I will not be allowed to get any food on my own for like a month(because I got none immune system at all).  I`ve got no money at this moment, and my mum denies to buy me one because she did cook something too. So, I got no big hopes but I`ll give it a try here :D . Proof for the chemo: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/j9qpb/iama_sick_16_years_old_with_myelodysplastic/  Also at this moment im having a Venae Needle in my arm, can take a photo of it and my nick or whatever you wish.(they need it for tomorrow so they can make me sleep before they get access to my heart).  Btw. I doubt anyone is here from germany, so I have paypal also, I would need 8€=~15$ or something.
0	I have never done this before and it sounds cool. I would like to send someone a gift from my house. A personal object of mine that I choose based on information you provide ( such as your interests ).
0	So, Reddit, want to prove him wrong?
0	Hey there! I am so exhausted I've chased after a tot all day that is teething and refuses to listen to the word NO. am hungry and a warm pizza and breadsticks would just make my kiddos month. I'm a single working mommy and getting treated to dinner is not something I've gotten in over a year! I'm also struggling so I cant treat myself, So this would be awesome! Please? I have helped out in a randomacts and babyexchange but not on this reddit yet,I do plan too :)  Thanks  :) 
0	I am super hungry in Arizona. I would love a pizza. 
1	I am seriously stressing about being able to pay my rent and utilities, and the three dollars in my bank account has to hold me until my last paycheck gets here, so I'd really appreciate it if someone could help me out with some pizza. Being independent for the first time is hard. -_-
0	There is a total of six people living in our small apartment. There isn't a much income coming in because it's extremely hard to find jobs out where I am. I've been doing odd jobs for the past six months or so just trying to scrape together money to help my grandma pay for our rent.   I only eat a couple times a week because there isn't enough food to go around.   If someone sends us a pizza, it would hold us over for about a week. It would be greatly appreciated.   **EDIT:** I live in Youngstown, OH.   **I will draw and send you a picture of anything you want as payment.**
0	I'm just hungry I get paid in three days and I'll pay someone a pizza back. Straight up.
0	I just have no money right now and am tired of eating pasta and refried beans :\ I will buy one when i get paid! this is my first time on here! :) i have a pizza guys around that will deliver....10 bucks for an x-large cheese!
0	Things are rough, money is tight and even tho the noodles are good, a pizza would not be bad at all. If you do, send me your e-mail so we can chat and share a nice time...we can both eat pizza at the same time
0	Dunno how this works really, but I thought I'd try it. Sunflower seeds are getting a bit old, lol.

1	I know Christmas eve is tomorrow, but I figured if I posted now this might be seen. Here's the deal, I am a mom of 2 little ones (4 and 1). I will be doing all the Santa duty tomorrow night: wrapping, stockings, putting together toys and trying to make it look like someone visited lol. My husband has to work so this will be the first year I am going solo. (Ironically he works at Pizza Hut lol...unfortunately they dont allow employees free pizza). Anyways, it would make my night much easier to have a pizza delivered. Figured I would ask :)We have a Dominoes, Papa Johns, and Pizza Hut locally.  Thanks for reading even if I dont get my pizza.Happy Holidays!  I used the new Verification system in the sidebar so anyone who offers, I can PM my verification code to prove I am not a scammer.
0	My kids are home for the summer, and I have NOTHING good to cook tonight. Payday is a few days away and (despite my epic culinary skills) I can't muster up anything tasty. Last night I tried to make a spicy noodle dish with broccoli that caused the kids not speak to me for the rest of the evening. Please help me reclaim my position as a cool mom. The kids have different tastes, but a nice pepperoni pizza would do the trick. Thank you for considering me and the little ones. 
0	I found this community through [another post](http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/iphuy/during_an_illness_a_friend_recommended_reddit_to/) and thought it sounded pretty ludicrous, so I figured I would check it out. I pop in, read through the sidebar and notice this tidbit:  "Requestors, please be COMPLETELY HONEST about your circumstances. We don’t mind multiple requestors or asking for pizza just for fun or asking for any reason."  Darn interesting, I figured that the community here would be completely against people who are not starving and out of cash requesting pizza, but I absolutely fucking love pizza, so here I am testing it out  Again, being completely upfront, I am not in any ridiculous need for pizza, besides my undying love for it. I pay my bills every month, I have a decent lump of money saved up in the bank, all is going pretty well, but here is the request anyways!  Oh almost forgot, here is my verification code: ZkmSFEfYfT6b  EDIT: Forgot my general area as well, Detroit Metro area!
1	Just kidding. I'm so hungry right now and a pizza would hit the spot. I will draw you an excellent picture(whatever you want me to draw really). If that doesn't satisfy you, maybe I could take pictures of cats for you (karma compensation for the pizza)
1	Would appreciate anything, thanks so much.
1	Hey everybody,  I've read through a lot of these requests, and there are a lot of people much worse off than I, so if it comes down to it, I hope they get help first.  That being said, I would be extremely grateful if someone would be willing to help me out.  Like I said, I don't have a sob story, no little children's mouth's to feed, but I'm kind of stuck in a rut in life, and I think pizza might cheer me up.  It's Wing Wednesday at Pizza Hut, and I couldn't tell you the last time I didn't have a meal that wasn't prepared out of a plastic bowl or metal cup.  If someone had it in their heart, and wanted to help me out, I would be forever grateful.  Thanks 
1	I will go ahead and say that I got a pizza meal from here before as to not seem like I'm scamming anyone. I have been promised 2 well-paying jobs and one minimum wage + .40 to fill in the gaps of unemployment of a second job, if that makes sense, but I'm waiting until they call me in for that expendable job, a background check for one, and a test request for the other. I will be able to pay forward this one and the previous random act of pizza when I can get my life straight. I will pay the previous one forward whether I get food from this or not. Didn't want to sound like I'm taking that promise to pay it forward hostage. Anyway, it would benefit me, my roommate, his brother, and his mom greatly if we could get some pizza.  Edit: Not caring what trolls like francewinwars say, especially if all they do is convince people to NOT help the less-fortunate. If anyone wants to roll the dice and buy us pizza for the day, I will pay it forward as soon as I get spare cash, which should be within the next couple of months.
0	our cat always jumps onto the counter when we eat or cook, and begs for food, i always offer to him, but he never takes it.  but today he decided to lay down on my freshly delivered Hawaiian pizza.  i only got to eat one slice.  help a fellow redditor out?
0	Not to post some long, drawn-out sob story I'll just leave it to this: It's been going pretty badly for a while now and it'd be nice to have some lunch today.  I'm in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota. 
0	Im feeling really ill today, and out of decent food in the house. My friend told me about this subreddit and decided to give it a go. I don't get paid until Friday but I hope to return the favour after this date. Any help will be welcomed. Thank you reddit!
0	So we've been living off ramen the past couple days due to low funds, I just want something different. Thanks!
1	I am a single mother recently out of work doing my best so that my little girl can stay happy her father is not around and it gets hard for us Im not on any government assistance and Im in school and it makes me cry at night when I can't even get her something so simple as pizza funny how u realize the little simple things in life like pizza this request is not only for me but more her she would be soooo happy thanks 
0	My girlfriend has been working a lot lately and has been feeling sick, and her favorite food is pizza, so she would be really happy to enjoy a pizza.  Edit* she gets off at 6.  Edit two* she isn't coming over on account of feeling worse, is there someone who can order it for her house?
0	5 days after christmas my boss texts me to let me know that myself and my girlfriend no longer have jobs.  This has been sort of a shitty start to a new year and a pizza from a stranger would be awesome.
0	I just thought it would be a nice idea, definitely will pay it forward on payday.  Edit: I've never done this before so I apologize if I messed up somehow.
0	Hello guys, This time of the year is really rough on me, I had to find a 6 month long internship. I found it but I used all my monies on stamps, letters bus tickets and calls (200 places called woohoo !). I could use a tasty tasty pizza tonight (it's ~9pm right now in France). I posted another sumission 2 hours ago and it seems that it ended up in the spam filter, let me know if I should delete this one. Have a great day !
0	Just sucks that i am going to be unemployed soon and have been applying like crazy without anyone offering a job. I also caught the flu the pass couple of days. Thanks for looking RAOP. 
0	The electric company turned off my power last night, I payed the bill, with what money I had left, but they said they won't turn it on until monday. I have little food, and what I do have is freezer stuff that I can't cook. I have two long papers to write for class and I'm pretty much running on empty and can't concentrate. What's a girl gotta do to get some pizza =\. This post honestly makes me feel so pathetic, took a lot of courage to finally post it, not a fan of asking for help.  It would really help if someone could send me an egift card or something, then when im back on my feet ill payt forward as much as i can.
0	I wanted to surprise my roommate and girlfriend with some tasty lunch after they get off work tomorrow morning, and what better than some pizza?!
0	Throwaway bc this is embarrassing. Ben off work for a few weeks (injury, still have a job just can't work until i'm better), no money until end of jan (screw u ei) and bank account pretty empty. My roommate has been awesome about groceries but he had to leave town a couple days ago bc of a funeral. Fridge &amp; cupboards basically empty.  So anyone feel like sending me some pizza? 
1	So, I've been having a really terrible week. On Saturday my cat of 12 years passed away(had him since I was 10, really the best cat i've ever met). On Monday I found out that my hours are getting docked, meaning I have to start saving this very moment or I won't be able to afford both food and rent in a month or so.   Here's a picture of Ping- my cat, from a few months ago:  http://i.imgur.com/wbF7K.jpg 
1	I've loved RAOP for a very long time and always wanted to participate and give someone pizza, but never had the chance.  Now that I'm in a time of need I feel like RAOP will be there for me.   I haven't eaten for two days and only slept about 20 hours this week due to working on installations.    **However!**  I was just commissioned for two pieces and will be paid within the month!  So for the person who does help me out tonight, I will buy you or a person of your choosing pizza once I get paid.   Thank you in advance!  This is honestly one of the best communities on Reddit.
0	Hey guys, my roommate and I are stuck in back-country middle of fucking nowhere Virginia until the 17th. That's when I get paid and until then we are stuck here. Here's some evidence of our dietary deficiency. You could save two stomachs! http://imgur.com/a/Zl3zX    
1	My children and I have had a hard time lately. I am financially broke since my ex (the kids dad) has stopped paying child support. We have been living off what we get from the local food give away for the last month. We are in Eastern Iowa. Any help is appreciated. Thank you in advance.  TY logicday for helping us! My children and I appreciate it!
0	Hello fellow Redditors!  Saving up for the $350 co-pay to have my wisdom teeth removed (too close to nerves).  A little light on cash for dinner today/tomorrow.  Anything would be appreciated!
0	Totally broke and would really enjoy a warm pizza. It has been forever since I have had one, now that I'm broke pizza is more of a luxury.
0	i know it's a new account but i can do the verification thing i seen this posted on facebook and thought i would give it a shot.. no sad story or nothing just first night in my apartment after leaving my husband... and wanna give the kids something special.. they are still adjusting to not having him around.. i have a phone so i can take pics i just don't know how to get them on here. if someone wants to help that would be AWESOME! if not or if you do thanks for all you do for the people on here.. it's a great deed :) 
0	Hey y'all,  I'm a college kid in Conway, Arkansas who's pretty broke at the moment. I'm cool with ramen, but I'd be even cooler with some pizza, since my school cafeteria, for whatever stupid reason, doesn't serve dinner on Saturdays. Hmph.  Anyway, as stated in the title, I will definitely sing you a song in exchange for such a wonderful act of feeding me! And I promise to share the pizza with my roommate, because I'm a nice lady. ;D
0	so im broke (per usual) but this time im out of gas and spent the last few bucks on cat food... its not his fault im irresponsible w/ my money right? i tried to reach out to my wonderful friends on facebook, but as it turns out no one loves me as much as i thought they did. this is quite a sad day for me indeed. help a girl out, order me a pizza? i'd even take thai delivery... that would make this the best day ever, let me tell ya.  dc metropolitan area... THANKKKKKS &lt;3
0	I never thought it would come to this but I'm trying my luck.  I told my parents about 2 weeks ago that I enlisted for drama school next year instead of finding a job with my masters in communication science that I'm graduating end of this semester.   They promptly threw me out of the house and told me I could go do street theater if I ever needed money. I would if it wasn't -2° out. 4 years ago they told me the same about communication, except they told me if I need money I could go write about lost cats in the local paper.   Been out of money for 10 days now and my parents and sister are not picking up their phones, so they seem pretty serious about it. But I'm set on doing this.   I'll be getting a paycheck in about a week but I'm out of rice and pasta. I'd be enormously grateful and would do anything for a pizza right now.   [I see there's an international ordering guide in the sidebar.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/ns3dj/the_definitive_guide_to_ordering_internationally/) I'd be more than willing to guide you through the process of ordering, which should be fine with a credit card. You'd be ordering from www.just-eat.be which has always been reliable and is always a safe bet for the student population here.  I'm counting on your random act of kindness to not let me go to bed hungry two nights in a row.  Thank you and my apologies for the tearjerking. My parents will turn around soon, so it'll be fine.
0	Hey, I'm just a regular Uni student that's out of money and low on food, It'd just be awesome to have a pizza instead of rice and ketchup :) I hate sob stories so I think I'll just leave it there...  Thanks for looking!
1	My parents are out of town for the weekend and I was left no money for food, I would really appreciate a pizza right about now.
0	Hi guys,   Four members of the USCG are currently on watch and unable to leave our posts for some food. Anyone feeling like making some blue-suiters happy with a couple of pizzas?  It would be greatly appreciated!
0	Hi everyone,  I've been scrounging around for money for awhile now that I'm taking an extra summer course load (something that will ultimately save me money in the long run). My friend, a fellow redditor, suggested that if I was ever hungry and needed help, there were people in a magic place that would get you a pizza. Well, I'm finishing up with a really long week of backstage work and if I could have a pizza when I got home later tonight, it would make me such a happy boy.  I didn't believe it, but here I am. I'm an avid fan of Star Trek, Archer, and theater to give you a little info about myself.   Anyone willing to help will receive a long distance air-five and lots of appreciation from my empty belly. :D
0	I am currently on a diet and going to the campus gym, and I am maintaining myself healthy, but sometimes there are just times when I need to satisfy a craving.  No sad story, just want some pizza
1	I have just under $13 to get me through until next thursday. I've been eating peanut butter sandwiches for a couple of days and a hot pizza sounds amazing. One pizza would most likely last me 2 or 3 days.
0	Please excuse me if I do anything wrong I'm new here and all the information in the sidebar just confused the hell out of me a bit  A bit about my situation well I am from the UK living at home with mother and brother. brothers company he works for has gone bust he has no money and mother is at step mothers caring for her and left little food in the house. I am a fairly young girl I don't work because I have social anxiety issues and my dad is retired gets very little money on pension from the state.  my brother and I usually eat noodles for dinner on the days my mum is away but he is an eating machine there are none left not sure what I am supposed to eat and a friend directed me here. feel slightly ashamed to have to resort to this though please don't take that the wrong way. any help kindly appreciated though definitely not expected  thanks for reading :)
1	EDIT: CayucosKid was kind enough to buy me a couple pizzas, they just showed up and not only taste amazing, but will feed me for the rest of the weekend. Thank you so much.  So, my roommate had told me about this Reddit, and I had planned to keep it in mind to give other people pizza every once in a while. I wasn't planning on using this for me...but I'm in a really tough situation right now.  A little background: I had to take a hardship withdrawal last spring and drop out of college when I lost my dining hall job. I managed to get a new job at a call center in town that is "always hiring" and that's been pretty decent, but not quite enough to pay the bills and pay for food. I've been surviving off the kindness of my landlord/roommates, (I do dishes I don't have to pay for food) but that can only go so far. I'm attempting to go back to school so I don't have to pay my student loans back, especially since the call volume is dropping at the center and I haven't been getting the best hours.  According to the government I make too much money to qualify for food stamps, and my dad makes too much money for me to qualify for Pell Grant. My car has been spazzing out and I think it's probably on it's last legs, and today I didn't even make conversion at work for the month, so I don't get any bonuses. Overall everything's just been a bit rough, I definitely plan on paying it forward as soon as I get everything together. One of my landlords wants me to dogsit for a couple weeks or so next month, and I'll be able to cover everything then. It's just been a really rough day and I could use a meal that I didn't have to cook myself today.
0	No sob story here, just a college kid who could use some food tonight. I'm from Southern NJ btw if it matters. Thanks so much for at least taking the time having patience to read this, and triple thanks if you want to fulfill it.
0	would really like a pizza, i am broke and the cupboards are bare, and you can only eat so many ramen noodles... thank you
0	Two of my four kids play sports and  on two nights of the week they both have practices at the same time in different towns. My husband takes one to Soccer and I take the other to Softball. After that we head home for a fast dinner before baths and bed. Tomorrow night it's suppose to be bean and cheese burritos as we are trying to stretch our food budget, not my favorite thing. A pizza would sure be great but cash is low until next payday. Would love to find a pizza hero for the night. We have lots of choices nearby, Pizza Hut, Dominos, Papa Johns and Round Table. Thanks! D in Cali!  http://contributor.yahoo.com/user/124589/danielle_crofford_fetters.html This is who I am&lt;/a? Can't post a picture right now cause h and I had our  cell phones turned off to save money for a couple of months. 
0	Don't get to spend as much time with him as I'd like to. We both love pizza! Help us out plleeeaaassseee!
0	We were going to the beach to take pictures for our pen pal in the US and it rained so we are very sad and would love a pizza. So now I am going to watch Game Of Thrones! I can draw alright, so if you give me a cartoon character I will draw them for you!    Thanks for reading :)
1	I would really appreciate a meal without having to walk to the grocery store in my state. I'm rather financially short but I would love to pay it forward with my next paycheque. 
0	My amazing son Caleb was born three months ago. He's wonderful but a handful. (As is the significant other and other son.) Things in our house are a little crazy now because I went back to work on Monday.  Chores and bills are piling up and I'm EXHAUSTED. Cooking is the last thing I want to do after diapers, homework, and housework. Money is a little tight because I won't get my paycheck for two weeks.  If there's anyone out there who can help a slightly overwhelmed and extremely tired mom, it'd be greatly appreciated. The family would probably appreciate it more than I would.  Thank you everyone!  Note: This account is new but I can contact you from my older account if you want.
0	Kia Ora, No special story, Injured my leg cycling and ramen noodles just aren't as nice the fifth time around, Would love a nice slice of 'za in my Stomach!
0	I don't eat the baby animals but I do enjoy me some cheese. Vegetable are for salads. [edit] My apologies, forgot to mention I am from Canada. Thanks to HOTMAMMA for trying anyways!!
0	Hello there, RAOP. Pittsburgh PA here. As the title states, I have been out of work and been living off my food stamps.  I am not doing horrible, I promise you that, but I have the biggest hankering for a pizza.  I assure you, once my bills are in order again, I will pay it forward.  Thank you for your time, and consideration. 
0	For obvious reasons, I created a new account for this request. To prove that I'm not just trolling you guys, I took [a picture](http://imgur.com/a/r24Lh) of my medication bottle and some of the literature I was given at the appointment where I had to terminate the pregnancy.   Before anyone judges me (though I know this is a friendly group of people; I have been fortunate enough to receive before under my real username), I believe I did the right thing, and my partner didn't just abandon me after I did this. I got the (*gulp*) abortion on Friday, and he made sure I was taken care of during the worst of the aftermath. But today, he's at work, and I'm pretty much confined to the couch. There is food in the house, but it's stuff I'd have to prepare. Preparing a real meal for just myself while I'm still crampy doesn't seem like fun right now...  I'm willing to reveal my identity and real username to the person willing to gift me, in private of course, to also prove that I've been on reddit for quite some time. I also have a few bucks here for a tip for a delivery driver (I obviously can't drive right now).   I know there are people on here who haven't received who are more deserving, but I'd love some comfort food. Absolute understanding if no one feels like it, though. :-)
0	My dad, my mom, my sister and I live together in a basement apartment with a family upstairs, so we're not the most fortunate either but it seems like other people may need a pizza more so by all means give it them if you want. We get a pizza on Saturdays, my mom doesn't make that much and it'd be cool if I could effectively make it free.  I live in Ontario, Canada. =)
1	I certainly don't want to take advantage of anyone's generosity, but I'm so tired of "White Chicken Lean Pockets" and "Pepperoni Pizza Lean Pockets"... If anyone's feeling especially generous, I promise I'll pay it forward as soon as I have the ability to. Pizza would totally make my evening.  PM me for details?  Thanks for helping a hungry guy.
0	I just got fired from my job as a guitar teacher at a school and feel like shit, if anyone would be nice enough to send me a pizza it will make my week
1	Hey guys. So it's Friday night and I'm doing work/preparing for finals next week. It's a long night of work ahead of me...(weekend as well). I'm running low on funds (the heat bill this winter was been ridiculous) and a girl would love a nice old cheese pizza to feed me for the next day or so. There's a rumbly in my tumbly; it would make all this coding more bearable!   Apparently the odds are slim but I would truly appreciate if someone would help me out. If not, peace, love...and enjoy your weekend!
0	  I am a single mother with 2 daughters. Every since that storm on April 27th we have had a hard time getting back on our feet. I get paid tomorrow. We just need something to eat tonight. 
0	I sort of survived all day yesterday on a jar of crunchy peanut butter, and most if not all of my income is going to a lease that I have to finish for the next two months. I really like playing music, skating, and playing video games, but I don't really have the energy right now. If you guys could help me out, I could probably make the slices last me the week. Thanks for your time.
0	Due to an administrative error, four of us are sitting here folding, stapling, and applying mailing labels to 1,300 newsletters that have to go out for our organization. Oh, these have to be done tonight. We've been working for two hours and expect to be working for four more. Pizza would be spectacular! :)  [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/A7wub.jpg) a small portion of our pile of newsletters (sorry for the quality, it's my crappy iPod Touch camera).  You guys rock!  EDIT: We're near Grand Rapids, Michigan.
0	Okay so money is REALLY tight right now, and unfortunately our pantry is pretty much down to spices and some old milk.  A pizza would really make our day right now &gt;.&lt;.    Located in Moncton NB Canada!
0	Pretty pretty please?
0	I've been debating whether to post here or not, because I am just beyond shocked. My boss called this morning and said they company had to let me go. He said they had to let several people go and because I was newer I guess I would be one of the first to go. I just started a month ago and had been looking for work for 4 months. I don't know what to tell the wife as I've been at the computer most of the day trying to take my mind off of it while looking for work. I'm hoping she will take the news as best as she can over a good meal. We're not without food, but I know that she loves pepperoni and mushroom pizza.   What's left in the bank and what's coming in the next check will all go to bills, so I really have no way of treating her to her favorite. I've worked hard to provide for my family, but I feel like less of a man when I can't. I'm hoping someone can help me treat my wife to her favorite and that she will handle the situation well. Thank you for reading and understanding.
0	Just looking to get some pizza tonight. Have no cash, and no food right now. Completely flat broke until Friday, but I will pay forward as soon as I get paid. :) If there's anything else I can do, just let me know.
0	sorry if the title seems quite melodramatic. In all honesty it has been pretty bad for me. Was dating the girl of my dreams, and I made a decision that was pretty big and had quite a large impact on my life for the better. She was in full support of this decision throughout the relationship until one day she came home and told me she needed to call it off and she couldn't handle it anymore. Less than 2 weeks later she is dating someone else, and its now been less than 2 months, and she is getting married to him. This breaks my damn heart. All my money has been getting dumped into her before all this, and since I am on disability I didn't have a whole lot to begin with. She kind of ruined me financially and emotionally. I actually just spent the last of my money on my car insurance the other day. On top of all of this everyone in my social circle have all just stopped talking to me for reasons they wont explain. I have literally been sitting in my room alone for days on end.  I REALLY hope this doesn't come off as too much of a sappy story, but in all honesty, I don't really care if I actually get a pizza out of this story or not. I just wanted to be able to tell my story and hoped that someone cared enough to listen.
0	I would love to help out some friends who have helped me out, but it will be years before I have money to repay them.  It would be awesome if I could show my gratitude by having pizza sent to their house as a surprise.  It's 2 guys and a girl and they ain't picky.  Any love?
0	Hi, first timer here! I'm down to my last $10, waiting for some good news later next week. My job, home and girlfriend all fell away in the past couple of months, and I have little else left. I could really use some help; a pizza would give me 2 days of good eating, maybe even enough for the whole weekend. I'm in Manila, Philippines. Pizza can be ordered online from yellowcabpizza.com.  Sincere thanks!
0	Been a lurker for some time, figured I'd give it a shot. Nothing special about me. Just moved to San Francisco and don't know many people, so I figured I'd just stay in tonight and hope for some cheesy goodness. :)
0	I'm home from college for the summer and my parents are gone for the weekend. Unfortunately, my LCD screen failed on my toshiba laptop and after shipping it to them, they've told me that I owe them $200 for fixing the POWER JACK before they'll fix my screen despite the fact that it's under warranty and that I didn't send it in for them to fix anything but the screen. After arguing with them over a span of two days and looking at other options, I gave in and am now broke. I've eaten ramen for virtually every meal for the past 2 and a half days and I can't do it anymore. It would be sweet if a fellow redditor could help a guy out.
0	Promises to pay it forward when I pass the test! AWWW YEAH. 
0	[It's not even bunny shaped.](http://i.imgur.com/7x4O7.jpg)
0	Nothing too drastic, and I can live without, but I wouldn't say no to a pizza right now. 
0	This week has got to be the hardest week of October so far...and it's about a week before my birthday as well.  So far, it's started off extremely stressful: annotated bibliography due tomorrow (10/13/2011) for art history along with 500-600 words of a proposal + thesis + works of art; horrible critique in advanced drawing 2...the redo for two of our projects is due this Friday (10/14/2011); I have a psychology test on drugs that Friday as well...; I gotta put out three logos by Thursday of next week which I haven't done yet because of the above items.  I could go on about how crappy this week has started and can only say that I wish time would go faster to get to my birthday (October 21!!!).  Would someone be kind enough to send pizza for these long nights to come?
0	Speaking of do, we have poopwater in our tub. I have been cleaning out the tub for 3 hours.  Yup.
1	There seem to be a lot of people on here more deserving than I am but I will give it a shot.  I'm a 24 year old public servant (Police/Fire Dispatcher) and my last check came up way short because of some unforeseen BS.  I've made it almost 2 weeks with 5 bucks but with 4 days left its run out and I've run out of ideas.  Any help would be appreciated. 
0	Hello fellow redditors. I will be very honest, I am one of the people who have come here after seeing the media coverage. Well I have been here before, but mostly just lurking. I haven't been able to afford much for myself lately, so that's why I haven't really participated much here, but it is something I plan on doing once I get some more funds in the bank account.  So here's my story. Tomorrow is one of my really good friends 23rd birthday. It's been a rough year so far for both of us (both had breakups around the same time) and since then, our friendship has really become a lot stronger. I've been in the negatives in my bank account the last two weeks and I can't afford to get him anything for his birthday (it's a byob party and I don't even have any b to b) He's having about 6 or so people over tomorrow to celebrate and I think it would be awesome if we could get some birthday pizza for the party. I know there's a lot of people out there who would better benifit from pizza, but this would mean a whole lot to me if someone could help me out tomorrow evening. I'll pay it forward when I can afford!
1	So here I am, I'm jobless and literally have no money to my name. I get £80 every 2 weeks from Job Seekers Allowance thanks to water supplier taking a chunk too, also I have to pay all the bills and well having done that I had little money for food and needless to say I have ran out and I am desperate as I don't get paid for a few days. If someone would be kind enough to help me out I will love them forever and try and repay their kindness as soon as I can.
0	Sitting on negative 240$ in my bank account.  Have worked sparingly the last 6 months, just enough to pay rent/utilities.  I haven't had my phone for 2 months because I can't afford that, first time I've ever had my phone shutoff since I've had it, 10 years.   Of course I will buy someone else a pizza in the near future as well!  Anything helps!  Thanks guys. 
1	Not picky at all; anything is greatly appreciated.   Edit:Doesn't look like its gonna happen but thanks anyway
0	Found out I still owed the government money now I only have $2.  Just want a pizza to last me for a few days.
0	Hey, i'm low on money, don't have hardly any food in my house, and just need something to get through until tomorrow night!  I'm really hungry and would love a pizza!
0	Been a bad week, My birthday was followed by my SO getting arrested for being in the wrong place at the really wrong time. I spent 18 hours not having a clue where he was. Court yesterday to find out that he's being charged with something he wasn't involved in and had no idea was  going on. Just would love some pizza to pick up my spirits
0	So I live with my BF we are both unemployed currently. He has been searching for a job for the past 3 months after being laid off with no such luck, which is really beginning to take a toll on him. I have recently lost my job last week as well. Bills/rent are coming up in the next week and we are still scrounging/selling whatever we possibly can. We have began running low on food within the past week (instant rice, cereal, and ramen). were afraid that if we go to buy groceries before bills/rent are paid off, we will not have enough to pay them. A pizza would be a nice change for dinner and quite possibly even help my BF to keep his head up and not get discouraged his job hunting.
1	So Let me just start off with an introduction. I live in a house With 13 people. We all Pay for everything together. Including food, It's basically part of our rent. We also have 4 other houses that are run this way and we all work together. Well we went to place our monthly bulk food order this week. we go through this guy who used to lie here because he does it for a few places and get a discount this way. well anyway this week we get a notification that our bulk order didn't go through because the company didn't get our money. So we call this guy and he SWEARS he paid them and its a company error. So of course we called back the company and they did a thourough search and found nothing. Now the man is not answering us or anyone. So We have no food money for this month and no food. It's my turn to cook dinner tonight and i dont know what to do. Can anyone help us out? Thanks in advance
0	True, I'm broke at the moment (and therefore unable to buy it myself), but I'm not starving. I just want some pizza. And does anybody really need a reason to *really* want pizza? :)
0	My mother lives in the area effected by the giant little bear fire in New mexico and is waiting to hear if she has a place to live or is coming back to New York to live with me. My father lost his job several month ago and is also likely about to move in with me. These two have been divorced for 20+ years and as much as i love them I have no idea if I can handle that. So I'm sitting here stressed out already wondering if I have enough to survive this economic hellstorm myself, let alone save my parents. I would love a pizza right now.
0	Playing Blacklight: Retribution, it's awesome. Today is my 20th birthday, which is also awesome. I don't have any awesome food though, just ramen  and cheap mac'n'cheese. It's tragic as I get paid TOMORROW! I just moved here to socal and none of my family knows my new address to send any possible cards. I've got $0.62 in my bank but I'm a registered caregiver for my mom so it's pretty relaxed here, her paycheck is rent, mine is everything else. Broke till tomorrow, would fancy a pizza pie.  http://i.imgur.com/T1f3v.png 
1	Throwaway for obvious reasons. So, I finally got a job!!! I really want to celebrate with my friends and keep my spirits up. I would love whoever could hook us up with a pizza please. I start on Monday and won't get my first check for at least 3 weeks.   I've been so down in the dumps wondering where my next meal would come from or how I would even get it. I've come from having a furnished living space to bare walls and a dream of being able to support myself again. I thought about committing suicide because I just couldn't see any end in sight to this.   I want to thank my friends who stood by me and helped me in my search. A pizza can't repay them for all they've done, but it's definitely a start. If you're in the Santa Fe area, you are more than welcomed to join us. I hope someone can help me do something nice for my friends. Thank you.
0	I've been hit hard with medical bills, insurance bills, and utilities, resulting in becoming completely broke.  If someone was willing to send a pizza my way it would go a long way, I'd make make whatever sent last for at least a week or more.  If anyone can help that would be most awesome and I'd try my best to help others on here when I financially can.
0	I mean... it really doesn't get much worse.  Help! xD
0	Moved into my new apartment with a higher rent a few weeks ago, no money until later this week :c if anyone wants to hook me up with a pizza, I'd be forever grateful.
0	      I'm new to Reddit and a friend a few weeks back told me about this when we were watching YouTube clips about 60 inch pizzas but I could barely believe it existed until I saw it today.        Sooo basically a few weeks back I had a job interview for some Christmas hours to get money for peoples presents... I was supposed to start on the 3rd but was told I couldn't until I sorted out my work reference. That was all fine and dandy until I call them up 3 days later to see what is going on to only get told they have filled all spots even though they said my job was guaranteed. Oh I also got hit with woman problems this week... PIZZA won't fix things but it'll sure help!    
0	I don't know if anybody can help, with almost everyone on here being US based, but if you can, I would really appreciate it.  I'm starting to think if quitting and getting unemployment wouldn't be better (We have a good system in Ireland, terribly abused though).  I'm not fussy, anything at all really.  Edit: It's rolling towards 10pm here, so I'll just mention that when this post is more than 2-3 hours old it'll be ok until another time. No late delivery in my city, as far as I know. Cheers.
1	I can't find it in me to use my normal account, so this is a throwaway;   long story short, my boss was upset at something I did and thus i'm unemployed for the time being; my kids are hungry and all I ask is for them to be fed. i don't need any food, just my kids. if anyone could help, i'd be grateful. thanks :)  the nearest food pantry is too far for us, my insurance has expired and i can't risk the drive
0	myself and 2 of my friends are planning to do an allnighter but we have no food 2 snack on and was wondering if anyone could help us out  thanks :)  we are in surrey i am kinda new 2 this so i dont know what to do
0	haha true. culinary student with a pretty sad looking fridge at the moment, could use some pizza in a temporary time of need!
1	Been really hard times for the entire family. Let me surprise my girl and 2 boys with pizza! They haven't had anything but ramen and rice in weeks. 
0	I don't really know how to go about saying this but life has been hard for the last couple years what with poor economy, and even poorer job placement, I haven't enjoyed the simple taste of meat and cheese mixed together with sauce and carbs in almost a year. Life really hasn't been right after the military fucked me over for health problems that they caused during service, so if there are any redditor out there with a heart right now, I'm tired of PBJ and just want some good pizza. If no response, I understand.
0	So my cheque from my temp job decided not to show up in the mail today, and won't arrive until Monday at the earliest now.  I am down to three cans of tuna, and two packages of ramen.  Anyone out there feeling generous?
0	My friends and I are working on our High School Senior gift, an enormous mural. (Even though we have already graduated). I recruited a bunch of non- artistic friends, because my original "art" partner totally bailed on me with the entire thing. We would love a pizza! PM if you are feeling generous! (No Pressure!) We are willing to carry out!
0	This is a throwaway account because I know people from real life on reddit. I have been having a LOT of financial trouble and I barely have enough to feed the kids, the wife and me. I have no problem letting the kids and wife eat over me but the thing is we barely have enough money to feed the kids an pay the bills. After I get done paying the bills I only have about 20 bucks to feed my family. I go to the dollar store and buy them some food but they are getting tired of eating the food from there. I would be so happy if someone were to give us a pizza and would gladly repay you when I get back on my feet. I'm at work right now but I'm doing this now because I don't want the kids to tell me how they want to eat something else. I live in Austin,Texas and if you read this thank you for taking the time to read my plea.
0	The title basically sums it up. I'm not looking for pity, just a helping hand. I'm a college student and I work part time at a decent job, but things are rough right now.     I've been paying my own bills since I was 17 or so, and have garnered a great deal of respect for the life of the working adult over the past couple of years. You never really appreciate the basics until you realize how much they actually cost. I'm currently putting myself through college while paying every bill that comes my way, so as expected, things are naturally tight. But a couple days ago my car broke down and after paying my internet bill (which was a necessity, since I work from home) I don't even have $1.00 to my name.  I'm not going to be broke forever, but my girlfriend and I are getting really burned out eating rice and ramen. A pizza would be much appreciated and would also be great surprise for my lady when she gets home in the morning (she's been 12 hour night shifts non-stop to help pay our bills, and finance a vacation that we have planned next month)  edit: I'm located in Nevada, USA. Near Las Vegas.   Thanks RAoP, and I'll definitely return the favor when possible :)
0	I'm having a hard time building up strength to even post this. I feel so weak, I haven't ate in 3 days, haven't slept, haven't worked.. I'm just so gone.  4AM Thursday morning I hear a big thump and then I hear the lady down stairs screaming in the hallway... Her husband fell in the shower I'm not sure if he had a stroke or what exactly happen, as she dialed 911 I held him in my arms and he stopped breathing. I tried to do everything I could to bring him back. I'm in shock and so sad, it's just unreal. I feel bad for the man and the lady.. I'm so depressed over the situation.   I live out in the country a bit, and I'm just too depressed to go anywhere or do anything.. I plan on trying to go see a therapist tomorrow (if ones open) and head back to work Monday.   I think it would be great if someone could order me a pizza and me snuggle up with my journal tonight and possibly watch a movie to help ease my mind.....I really don't feel comfortable driving, I just need to relax and do some coping skills.
1	I don't have a sob story or any of that kind of stuff people usually have around here. I'll be honest. I couldn't save any money for food since Christmas is around the corner and we all know that means gifts for all... Including rent. Sigh.   I would really appreciate the help if someone could lend a hand. I get paid tomorrow so I can repay it forward to someone here in need just as I am today.   Any Aussies can lend a hand? :S
1	I'd appreciate it so much if someone would help tide me over. I don't really have a sob story, it's my fault for not budgeting better but times are tough... been so busy studying and working part time. Hopefully I can  pay it forward.
0	Would love some grub as I'm in the process of moving out. Last bit if my check went to final months rent but fuck all that, a free pie would make anybody's day. 
0	I moved away from home a little over a year ago to be with my husband. I have four younger sisters and my family is very close, so this was tough for all involved, but we keep in touch, and not a day goes by when I don't talk to at least one of my siblings via Steam or Facebook. I just missed an IM from my little sister lamenting that another week is going by, and my family hasn't got the money for food right now. She was upset because their pets are hungry, and that all she'd had for lunch was a piece of bread. I feel awful about this, but I'm not really in a position to do anything about it myself. Making matters worse, I thoughtlessly made a comment on Facebook earlier today, complaining about all the leftovers in my fridge, and wishing that my sisters were around to help. How I must have made them feel upon reading that puts me near tears.  Their financial situation is complicated and I don't want to get into detail, because it's not my place to talk about their problems in a public forum. Suffice it to say, they're going through a rough patch, but if someone would be so kind as to provide them a hot meal, I hope that a random act of kindness would help them feel better about life in general. I've been where they are, and I know how low it makes a person feel not being able to afford food.   Here's my favourite picture of me and my siblings and our dogs, taken about a decade ago: http://i.imgur.com/jDz5L.jpg  Thanks in advance to anyone who's taken the time to read this.
0	Hello everyone, my buddy wanted to help me out so he told me about this fantastic place (hence this account being made today). I am a single soldier stationed at fort campbell. Today I've noticed instead of withdrawing the normal $150 for my car payment my bank has taken out $600 dollars leaving me -$527 in my bank account. They said they'll fix it but not till they open again on Monday. Normally this would be alright because I have a meal card except this weekend my on post dining facilities have closed for the Easter weekend. I haven't eaten since breakfast on Friday and could really use some food. Anything would do. I don't have a car or I'd try and forage around. This is literally my last option at this point.  If you want proof of the bank account I can send you a picture, if you can tell me how to take a screen cap of my phone (my only internet access).  Again thank you, and if you don't trust a new account I fully understand I'm just desperate.
0	We're a bit poor at the moment! Two younger brothers and I would LOVE a Pizza. Mum is working late pretty much all the time and we're still not seeing any money from it yet.  We'd just love something tasty to cheer us up so we don't have to eat frozen leftovers!  Thanks to anyone who even read this!
0	This is my first time hearing of this subreddit and I'd love it if someone could help me out. I'm just about starving. :( Thanks in advance and I'll return the favor.
0	The current heat way somehow fried my car and i havent been able to go to work this week. Money is now at a minimum. The nearest restaurants/grocery stores are almost a mile away from my house. i was kinda hoping someone could send me a pizza. I get paid friday and can use that money to fix my car, and then pay the pizza forward. Please help im a long time redditer that wants to remain anonymous. 
0	I've heard amazing things about this sub, so I figured I'd give it a shot.      &lt;p&gt;   Radiator cracked on me, and so my checking account got completely emptied...This is only weeks after a $2000 repair job on the rest of the engine, and is extremely frustrating. Would love to be able to eat something that isn't ramen or rice.       I'm not sure what sort of info i need to provide, but I guess the closest pizza place is Papa Johns and I'm in South Carolina.         Thanks to anyone to wants to help me out!
0	I waited for four and a half hours at the ER two days ago for a friend with alcohol poisoning to wake up. Said friend was ungrateful that I brought here there and has thusly ditched me. That being said, the ER gave me some weird chest funk and I can't talk and can barely breathe since I'm coughing so frequently. I also happen to be starving and can't leave my dorm building to get food. I'll pay it forward as soon as I have a voice to order a pizza with.
1	So it looks my graduation is going to get pushed back another semester. I'm going to be an 11 semester student (5 and a half years). Just got to keep trucking it.   P.s. My baby-girl would love some too but she's just spoiled. Here she is in a couple of hand-me-down outfits. http://imgur.com/a/SveRN
1	So this is my first [REQUEST] thread that I've made. It's just me and my girlfriend, both poor college students, wanting a pizza. I have posted to offers before, but never received. I will definitely be a giver when it is possible for me, but right now I'm waiting on paychecks in the mail and have no means of getting pizza for us.  If anyone would like pictures of us, we'll be glad to provide. Also, if there is anything you'd like to ask me, ask away. I'm open to just about any questions.  Thanks RAoP'ers!
1	I've known about this lovely subreddit for a while, but always decided against actually posting a request because there are people in so much worse situations than I. But, at this point the new tab isn't quite so dire, sooo....  I don't want to whine or drag on. Basically, I've been jobless for a few months now. My sister is my roommate; I'm basically crashing here, but have to be out next month, as she's apparently moving in with her boyfriend after that. No, I don't feel good about being a jobless layabout. I've been job hunting hard but nothing's been working out, and I can only really get around on foot.  Anyway, so the only food I've had around here is potatoes. Which wouldn't be so bad, but there's really nothing to put on them (no butter for baked ones, no ketchup for fries, no oil or vinegar for cooking them with.) It's better than no food, but the combination of dry potatoes and tap water is crazy bland. The aforementioned sister spends most of her time with her boyfriend; my parents dropped off the bag of potatoes a couple of weeks ago. I don't wanna complain or anything, it's good to have a place to stay (for now) and sustenance,  but... a pizza, of any kind or any place, would be so so rad. Haven't pizza since July (my birthday.)   I will of course pizza it forward immediately when I'm in a position to do so, this subreddit is such a wonderful thing and needs all the offerers it can get to keep it running.  Hope I'm doing this right! Thanks!
0	As the title suggests, I've promised my girlfriend that I'd make dinner for the two of us tonight, however I woke up rather sick today. I lost my debit card recently and am currently waiting on a new one in the mail, otherwise I'd just order it myself. Will pay it forward as soon as I am able. Thanks!
1	Work has been really crazy these past few weeks. I'm pretty sure the summer heat is making everyone possessed because I was literally running through the clinic today. I just got home and I have to work a 6th shift tomorrow because a coworker fucked up. If one more person cries on the phone with me I might scream.  Additionally, vet techs and assistants in American make a median wage of $24k a year. With my student loans, it barely gets me by each month.   Hook a tired lady who had to touch poop all day up with a pizza?    Edit: I'm a VETERINARY technician. 
0	I'm hungry.  Atlanta, GA
0	I am in desperate need of food until I can finish training at my new job, which doesn't even start until the 14th. I have only $4 to my name, which I need for gas for when I start my job, as well as to find a white button up shirt at Goodwill.   If anyone could help with a pie that could hold me over a few days, I'd be elated. 
1	First off, yes this is a new account. I've lurked around various subreddits for some time but I've never felt like I had anything to add. More of a reader than a talker I suppose. Anyways, my children's mother surprised me by dropping the kids off this morning, as she felt going to the lake with a new bf was important enough to warrant me taking a day off of work with no notice. I was supposed to have them this weekend, so I wasn't really prepared grocery wise. (None of this is her concern, but that whole thing is a story for a different subreddit.) If someone would like to make a couple of kids day a little better by giving them something besides ramen and toast, that would be great. I'm not creating this account just for this..I've been meaning to for a while and plan on posting a lot more, as well as paying this forward. Thanks for reading.  UPDATE: Thank you newchel. You're an awesome person.
1	I hate having to ask for help like this, but this is really my last option.  I recently had to take my dog to the vet to have a growth on her leg checked.  The exam was $50, the biopsy was $50.  Then the battery in my car went out.  Jumping it worked for awhile, but then a few days ago it stopped holding any charge.  New battery was another $100.  For the past 3 days, my husband and I have been subsisting on pasta.  Yesterday we ran out of pasta sauce, so I can still eat it, but it's so bland and I'm getting tired of it.  Plus, I still breastfeed my son, otherwise I would deal with the blandness, but when my diet tanks, my supply tanks.  (We are in Indianapolis)  Thanks for reading, let me know if I need to give any more information.  **EDIT** [mr-smor is a lifesaver!!](http://i.imgur.com/VLRyn.jpg)
0	Need some delicious pizza to go with the massive amounts of alcohol I'll definitely be drinking.
0	Umm, pizza god? Hi, its me, chemo. My little brother and I have no money for food, and our fridge is completely empty save for some frozen corn. Were trying to save that for the weekend. I will try to do any stunt you can think of for pizza. Jump off my roof? I'll do it. Ask a stranger for a ride around the block? I'll do it. Smoke peppercorns? You bet your sweet bippy. I will post a video of the stunt, and post it here. We live in north Texas, in the dfw area. Thanks for listening!
0	bought some drinks for my me and my friends last night and now im broke and hungry
0	Yeah title pretty much says it all.
0	We had an emergency that left us with one dollar in our bank account today, I would love to treat my 2 year old and 4 year old to a pizza for being so understanding the past week about how tight money has been. I will pay it forward tomorrow by getting a pizza for someone on here! Thanks for reading! (I am also verified (?) )  
1	I'm not in College, or a starving artist or anything like that. I've just been a bit unlucky lately. I'm a 36 year old single guy with a job. But rent, and other bills killed me this month. I thought I had enough funds in my account to at least keep me set with Mr. Noodles, I forgot about my monthly banking fee.  I had a small bag of chips Wednesday afternoon, and I get paid Monday, so I'll be fine then.. It's just really painful at this point and food is something I'm constantly thinking about.  I've got a few bucks to get on the bus to work on Saturday, so I can't really use that.  I'm really embarrassed to even be asking like this and I'm not sure how it works, so please be patient with me.  I guess that covers it. Thank you in advance.  Cheers folks.
1	I've been down on my luck lately. I have a job but I just can't get hours :&lt; (I'm trying to get a different job right now) not to mention that they didn't even pay me for my work last week (I've talked to them about it and I'm waiting for my paycheck but who knows when that will show up).  I did get a check to help pay for food from a non profit group my mom deals with but I was stupid and didn't cash it but deposited it. So I may be able to use it Tuesday or so but I'm running out of food. Overall I would love a pizza to nibble on for the next couple of days. I also do plan on helping people out here once my financial situation is all settled :3
0	It has been dark,dank and cold for the past few days and its been bumming me out. Could really use a pizza to help me warm up a little if anybody is feeling generous. Sorry for the repost it's my first time posting on this subreddit and was asked to include a general area.
0	Hi all! The past few days I've been getting pretty creative putting meals together but it's getting tough. And my older girl's having a hard time adjusting to 1st grade so it'd be a nice surprise for her tonight. If anyone could help that'd be awesome and I'll pay it forward right after I restock the fridge! Thanks!
0	Any help would rule.
0	Long term boyfriend dumped me when he came back from a month+ long trip in Europe, and I'm feeling really depressed. I've been really craving pizza and I'm sure pizza and tears go well together...
0	Unfortunately I'm broke until payday, so I thought I'd give this a shot!  I'm in Arkansas and can pay back whoever can help me out tonight on Friday. 
0	Eat all the pizza!
0	Im going home for the holidays tommorow, but im completely out of food! I would have to walk 25 minutes to buy one meal. A pizza would make my night awesome! Thanks  I live in Quebec, sherbrooke!
0	My school is opened these last two days (Monday and Tuesday) for finals even though a lot of people had most of theirs last week. My friend and I have an exam on Tuesday, so we haven't been able to go home early. But what I don't get is why all the food shut down without a prior notice. I've been living on meal swipes this semester, but now their useless and I'm broke, so no going out to eat. I just need a pizzaaaa.
1	It's ten here, but we're going to be up for some time and even if we don't finish it off tonight, we'll *definitely* eat it for breakfast because we're champions like that.   So yeah, keeping it short but can anyone help us out? It would make this weekend perfect. 
0	Exactly what the title says. She had about 20$ that needs to go to gas and we don't have any food for dinner tonight.
0	im working at a factory and we all havnt eaten yet today all hungry and payday isn't until tomorrow.....we are here for another 7 hours please someone feed us
1	Like a big pizza pie, that's amore!  Mmm Pizza Mia?
1	Hello,  I am a father and husband that has been looking for employment after being laid off for some time now.  There has not been much success and my wife has been carrying all the weight.  It has definitely been a struggle to see her work so hard without being able to help.   We have literally ran out of food today and must wait for her pay day to come on Thursday.  She remains positive that we will be okay even when I feel we are about to crumble.   Looking for help to say thank you to her with a pizza for dinner.   Please help.    Thank you so much!
0	Broke college kids would love to surprise my girl with a pizza tonight.
0	That's pretty much it. I'll be playing The Walking Dead: 400 Days all evening  Henderson, NV
0	I (Rachel) and my friends (Liz and Dylan) do not get paid for multiple days and are pretty much subsisting off of PB&amp;J, noodles with butter, and the last little bit of a bottle of tequila. It is nice tequila though. My point is, we are hungry and broke until further notice and we would love nothing more than a pizza at this very moment. Help a sister out and we'll hit you back, pay it forward, either or both. Much obliged   :)
1	Hey guys,  I posted [this](http://redd.it/i4s6l) over at r/Assistance a couple of days ago, and things are still pretty grim. I haven't had a warm, substantial meal in about a week or so, and I have absolutely no funds to speak of. A delicious pizza would go a long way towards brightening my day, and I'd be more than happy to pay it forward when I get on my feet again. I don't have any sort of preference, but I think both Pizza Hut and Domino's deliver to my house. Thanks for reading guys, and I want to say that this subreddit consistently amazes me. Y'all are awesome.
0	Self explanatory. Sending all money home, have used this months allowance for work stuff. My next day off is Tuesday. Let's hang out at the Pizza Hut and share a pizza (that you bought)!
1	I'm sure there are needier people on this subreddit, but I had to borrow 30 bucks to pay the rest of my share of rent yesterday and now I'm broke until next friday.  Pizza for me and my housemate that lent me the 30 bucks would be much appreciated for dinner.  Thanks in advance, it's subreddits like this that make Reddit such an awesome place. EDIT:CayucosKid got me covered, 2 pizzas, breadsticks, and a 2 liter of coke to boot!  I'll be eating good for days!  Thanks again.  (=
1	Hey all,  I'm the youth mission group leader at my Church, and they've spent the last two weeks working with Habitat for Humanity and other groups around the area to help out the community, and I would love to surprise them tonight with a nice tasty treat.  Anyone willing to help out some kids who were just giving back to their community?  Thanks and god bless 
1	I broke my leg racing my dirtbike in hare scrambles. Been laid up flat broke without insurance since the 15th. A pizza that there's no way I could afford at this point would totally blow my mind. I fully intend to pay this favor forward once I can provide for myself again.  *edit* Forgot to include location, I live in Minnesota  *edit2* request fulfilled by throwawayporksalad
0	Would be a huge lifesaver tonight......
0	So I started working at a small law firm and I haven't been paid since I started at the beginning of January. I am running low on funds after traveling across Texas (Lubbock to Austin to College Station to Kingwood and back to Lubbock) for an interview and to support my brother's pregnant girlfriend after she received some scary news. Would love to have a pie when I get home tonight. I promise to pay it forward when I can.
1	~~I've been lurking here for a while, but never had the need to request or the money to offer.~~  ~~I'm scraping the bottom of my cupboards and it's only the 22nd. This month has been really tight and I've been eating nothing but peanut butter jelly sandwiches and ramen for the past week because that's all there is left. I just got hired into a fast food job, so I'll be able to pay it forward next month for sure.~~  ~~I'm in the US.. anything more specific I'd be happy to tell you over PM!~~  Edit: Just in case you don't read into the comments, I was not referred here by [Wired or their article.](http://i.imgur.com/uYhdVT9.jpg) I've been on Reddit for 2 1/2 years and knew about RAoP long before that article was printed.  Edit2: Thank you for the pizza, ChairmanW! You're awesome!
0	I have been trying to make life happier for my children, since my wife went into rehab. They know that their mother is away, but I've had a hard time sitting them down and trying to explain where she is. When they ask I tell them that mommy was sick but she is getting better. Every pay day she would disappear for weeks at a time. I would drive around until I either found her somewhere, or she would come home with no money and "no clue" as to what happened with her paycheck. Supporting a household on my own was not something I was prepared for. I try to juggle my bills so that the most important bills get paid. I offered the power company half, but they would not accept it. I had to make a choice between getting food and having my kids stay in a home without power. We are down to 3 cans of tuna. We can eat on one pizza for today and tomorrow, as I get paid on Monday. I have a 5 year old and an 8 year old. Please help us.  
0	I'm not poor or in dire need, but I would  love to calm my stomach down.   
0	Broke and hungry...its that simple, no catch.  Believe it or not, I do not have an iTunes account but I have this iTunes gift card that I got for Christmas and will never use.  I will inbox you the card info for your verification and a pizza!  Thanks kindly in advance.  pics of gc here: http://imgur.com/a/bIDXW

0	I wanted to get some pizza for my wife and I, we've had a ruff work week and I wanted to get this coming week started right.   Thanks  Verification: OvbIeg5FlQ6A
0	Parents have been out of town for 5 days, left me meager supplies which i've gone through, and no money to get more food. So I could use some delicious pizza courtesy of reddit.  
0	I don't even think it could work, but I would be really thankful because I'm starving, penniless and sick of eating whole grain bread. As far as I know, the only way to get pizza here is over the phone. We have pizza hut, Domino's, Papa John's and some other local things. 1 dollar is about 500 Chilean Pesos. If we don't make it, at least we could have fun trying to figure out a way!  ps. yep, i've posted it before, but I'm still poor and hungry!
0	Before making this post, I did read through several threads and the sidebar on the right. I heard about this site a few months back on ABC, but I did not think to sign up.   I don't have a sob story or any real need for a pizza other than it will brighten my day. Since I've been on the site for a few days, my request will more than likely be overlooked. I'm not complaining :D ! I realize this is all random and that there are others out there who may have a genuine story and need pizza tonight. To everyone that has donated, keep doing what you're doing :)
0	I have been suffering from pretty bad depression and social anxiety over the past 6 months. Ended up dropping out of my last semester of university and quit my job during this time. I just maxed out my credit card on a new prescription, and I am out of even credit now. The bottom line is I have no money to buy any food right now and only have a few cans of beans left. I would love to have a nice hot pizza to get me through the next few days. I am hoping this newest prescription works how it should and I am able to get out and find a job because I would love to play it forward and help out a fellow Redditor in need. I verified my email and also have another account which has a bunch of karma, I just have a few friends on that account and would be too embarrassed for them to find out about my current situation. Thanks in advance for anyone that has taken the time to read this and hope someone can help out.   Some of the local pizza places are Pizza Pizza, Ginos Pizza, Pizza Hut, Domino's Pizza. Pizza Pizza being the closest. 
0	If anyone can get a pizza ordered to czech republic, I'd be very grateful. It'd be much cooler than eating porridge for the last 3 days!
0	To be completely honest, I just don't want to get out of my chair to go order myself a pizza. If anyone is feeling unreasonably philanthropic tonight, well that would be cool.
0	Unemployment check went to rent and utilities which were paid in full. I'm told I don't qualify for emergency expedited food stamps and that the process will take several more weeks. Can you help a guy out?
0	Totally understand I'm not as down in the dumps as some people who post here, but I'm in between jobs, finally leaving the retail environment and would love to celebrate.  Unfortunatly I'm between paydays and can't really do anything.    Hoping to get a pizza or two and invite some friends over,  I will reimburse you with a DOTA 2 key for each pizza, max of two!
1	I would like to request pizza this evening. A friend of mine is coming over to drop off Dexter Season 1 and she is not bringing me any food. I would like to wwtch this show with my young teens and enjoy some Papa Johns or similar. If anyone can help, thanks in advance.
0	Title is a pretty good TL;DR. Boss needed a scapegoat, I was handy. Had planned to make pasta but pizza sounds so delicious. Now that I'm income-less, pizza ordering will be eliminated. I'll draw you a picture as a thank you :) 
0	Hey, all.  I'm down to $5 in my checking account.  $10 to Dominos would allow me and my roommate to eat tonight.  We're both good guys, just have more bills than pay this week.  Hours got cut and rent is due.  Tomorrow we get to hit up the food pantry, but something tonight would be wonderful, if anyone can swing it.  Thanks.
0	my uncle and best friend just died in the past week all of my money is going to medical bills helppppppp pleasssssseeeeeeee  
0	Hey reddit,   My fiance and I recently sold everything we own and bought an rv so that we at least had a place to live. unfortunately that left us with no funds for anything else, and just like a champ our RV broke down. So, we are currently on the side of the road, in front of a friend's house. It would be really awesome to have a pizza to eat ourselves, but I would really like to have something to offer the household. We don't get our food stamps until the 9th, and just though that maybe reddit could come through in a pinch.   Thanks everyone!   P.S. I'm using my dad's old account so that i wouldn't be on a *new one     
0	I really love the idea of this "Random Acts of Pizza"  I'm kinda short on cash or else I'd be glad to send out of some pizza love.  I accidentally screwed up my wife's laptop the other day and I'm hoping to surprise her with some kick ass pizza.  Screwed it up soo bad she's making me buy her a brand new one...  and it was an apple macbook...  bla... Anyone from the Kansas City area want to pay it forward?  
1	Before I begin with why I'd like a pizza, I just want to say that all of you are wonderful human beings for the generosity you show. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. This isn't a sob story, I hope it doesn't come off that way. I understand life gets people down sometimes and mine has been especially hard to me lately. I'm just trying to explain my situation.  I recently got released from the hospital due to a bad bout of pneumonia. My insurance company wanted a deposit of 300 dollars. I'm a student and have my own apartment and support myself completely on my own, so this was a HUGE hit to me. I also just paid rent, my phone bill, internet bill, and some of my tuition for this coming semester, and BARELY scraped by, even though I had been saving all of my money other than that and some groceries.  I'm currently unemployed as well. I had a bicycle but I had to sell it in order to pay my deposit. My disability check does not come until the 3rd of July and I currently have 20 dollars in cash on me to last until then. I'm going to go buy some ramen noodles and soup mix once it cools down outside. My lungs are bad and it's stressful for me to walk in this kind of heat.  If anyone would like to donate a pizza to me, it would feed me for 3 or 4 days (I'm not a big eater). I only ever eat pizza when my friends have it, so it would not only feed me, but be a real treat for me as well!  I just have to tell you I am allergic to any kind of mushrooms. Anything other than that, I'm not picky at all.  Thank you so much for reading this, and I hope that soon I am in the position to donate a pizza to somebody else.
0	Like I said, he has been working towards this for quite awhile now, and after getting through by the skin of his teeth he is now a teacher in southern ontario. He has been working at the honda plant for quite a while but he couldn't quit because we always needed the money to get by. Now I'm moved away and wanted to congratulate him with his favorite food... pizza! :)
0	I have been living of top ramen for the past two weeks is there any way anybody could get me a domino pizza i have forgotten what real food tastes like.
0	My ex wife got married yesterday.  It hasn't even been a year since we divorced.  I always believed we'd work things out.  I made lot of desperate attempts in the last month as the wedding got closer topping it off by pouring my heart out and basically begging her not to go through with it.  You can imagine how far any of that got me.  I actually spent yesterday believing I'd get word that she called it off.  I stayed up all night checking her facebook page to see if it happened.  At 8am I finally crashed.  A few hours later I woke up and there was the wedding picture, front and center.  A little bit after that she had her name changed on there, and that was that.    The last thing I had to eat was a granola bar for breakfast yesterday.  I've got no food in the house, and quite honestly, I've started drinking and driving wouldn't be the best idea.  And you know what?  I'm going to keep drinking.  Part of me knows that I should eat though, or it's going to be that much worse tomorrow.  I've got no money though, no food, but plenty of drink.  I'm going to continue torturing myself tonight, and tomorrow will be a new day.  Tonight I wallow though.  It hurts.  Cheers!  P.S.  Am I the only one who thinks that the first wedding your kids are in shouldn't be one of their parents?
1	First timer!  I saw the post from that guy saying he was leaving because of all the sad stories. I think the "half-full or half-empty" rule applies here. You can see sad stories, or joy from getting help from a stranger!  Also, I will try my luck! It is not in the intention of feeding kids. I'm just a random guy that just moved to Montréal, QC. My delicious "flour-water-salt" pancakes got the job done for a few days. But now I think i need some fat in my belly :\   It will be paid forward before the holidays!   I will now leave you with this:   * 3 billion pizzas are sold annually, that's 46 slices each for every man, woman and child in the country.  Do you eat 46 slices every year ?    EDIT: Typo
0	I wil draw you something for a pizza.  I will sing.    I will try and make you laugh.  Help you on a homework question.      (Im horrible at all of these things.)
0	http://i42.tinypic.com/ngr32v.jpg  tell me that didnt make you laugh!   this is so relevant right now hahaha  i really want to order a pizza pepperonis, green peppers, onions, ham, and extra cheese  all the toppings needed to make the pizza i am fantasizing about  omgggggg   ):  my heart will be yours, completely if you blessed me with some 'za &lt;3 
1	Hey reddit,  I've really hit some hard times recently, lost my job, kicked out of my apartment, car broke down. Pretty much anything bad you could imagine going bad in one's life, it has happened to me.  All my family is in Colorado, so moving out there is pretty much out of the questions. So right now I'm crashing on my buddies couch, but I'm not sure how long that will last or how long until he loses his mind and kicks me out.  I would love to be able to pay him back someway or another, and pizza popped into my mind. Being as it is a Friday night, and I don't have the fund to do much anything but breathe and drink free water, I'm not going out tonight. Anyone have it in their heart to help out a fellow human being whose life has hit the skids? 
0	Okay guys so I'm kind of in the mood for some pizza, but I'd rather buy one for someone else! And I'm in an extra good mood today so I want to give two Redditors down on their luck some pizza today, and would also like some for myself. So if some lovely person would like to give me a pie, I will give two redditors of their choice a pie!  Edit: I'm all used up for my offers for now. But I'm still taking an offer for some pizza myself if some kind soul would oblige:)
1	So it's finals week and I haven't eaten all day... I just payed off the last of my housing and I've let my mom borrow around $400, so I don't have much money to get food this week. I would love a pizza, and would love to offer one as soon as I get my money paid back.  Thanks for this subreddit. I think you are all amazing people. :)  Edit:Forgot to say I live in Texas USA. :)
0	Dear fellow redditors , I had to pay for a ID card so i could register my self for a loan. But this left me with no money to survive the weekend please help! (Breda , Noord-brabant - The netherlands)

0	If you can help I would greatly appreciate it. If not, I appreciate you reading this. Thanks!
0	Please pm me for my address. I'll be up all night and all day tomorrow. I don't think I'll be sleeping well for a few nights.
0	I have been going on a downward cycle lately. I've recently lost my mother to cancer. Without me knowing about the loan my mother had taken out a few years ago, my family ended up losing our store. My grandparents put everything they had into that store and it makes me sick to know that it's gone. Depression has kept me away from many things and this includes the day to day business and just knowing how far in the red we were.  I have tried very hard to be a contributing member of society, but after 6 months of no work I am quickly losing hope. The one thing I have wanted for so long involves a tall glass of soda and a thick slice of pepperoni pizza. No matter how I dress up these minute noodles, the taste cannot compare to a delicious slice of pizza. I'm hoping some kind soul out there would be nice enough to treat me to some pizza please. I don't know exactly how this works, but I've been reading and I'm intrigued. Some pizza could definitely cheer me up. Thank you.
0	Well were having a lan party but our pizza guy is out of town so can some one help some fellow gamers out?
0	They are being fussy about it, Won't get sorted till August 12th at least.  I would normally be paid on a week to week basis but well not at the momment...  Requesting Thursday nights dinner.
0	A pizza would brighten my day, but really anything nice you could say would bring cheer
0	It's the first all nighter of the quarter and we are starting to get hungry! Unfortunately, too much money spent on project supplies and not enough left over for pizza. Thanks!
0	Cause Hungry, tired of noodles in a cup, and payday is friday.
0	I spent all of my food money to pay the last of my hospital bills from a surgery I had several months ago (my colon was removed). Pay day is tomorrow, but I have nothing to eat tonight.  I was also threatened with losing my job today because I pointed out several labor law violations at work this morning, and a pizza would sure help me out/cheer me up.  Edit: I live in Berkeley, CA btw.
0	So, tonight I'm staying in and writing a term paper for the next few days. It's on N. Scott Momaday's "House Made of Dawn" if you're curious. I would appreciate some brain food. :)   EDIT: And to make it fun, how about we make it one pepperoni and one with any combination of toppings. Your choice! (Except please no pineapple or fish.)
0	It would also provide an opportunity for our 11-year old daughter to recognize the good in the world, as of right now she can be a little selfish. Promise to Pay it forward!
1	EDIT: TAKEN CARE OF YAY.  Hello lovely Pizza Givers,  I'm a young gal living in Brooklyn, and I just moved from my cozy apartment into a basement room. I'm very sad to have left what was my home, my cat won't come out from under the couch, and moving down four flights of narrow stairs really made my tummy rumble. After paying for a U-haul and a huge load of cleaning supplies, I'm out of disposable income until my next paycheck, but goodness would I love a delicious, cheesy, pipin' hot pizza.   Thanks to all the kind souls who are putting faith in humanity back into the aether.  LOVE, T.  Edit: P.S. I know this is a blankish account. I'm a lurking sort of lady. If you'd like any further verification from me, I can do that. Also, I'll draw anyone a sketch who asks for one, just for shits and giggles.  P.P.S. OHMYGLOB. The amazing pizzamom gifted me a pizza and I am so very pleased. Expect photos shortly.
1	There's not much more to add than that. I'm unemployed and my mum kindly takes care of me however she can. Unfortunately she's only able to get part time retail hours, so money is always pretty tight. This month, there's been dramatically less overtime available, which in our house unfortunately means dramatically smaller/fewer meals.  It would be nice to surprise her with something nice for once!
0	Last week and a half hasn't been to good, car got totaled on Thursday n found out that the driver has no insurance, found out one of my family members has been commiting identity fraud past 5 years. N yesterday lost my wallet and food stamp card. Asking for a little help until Friday, will definitely be appreciated n once things settle down I will definitley give back.
0	So it's the end of the month, and my room mate and I are beyond broke. We have no food left, and no friends/family to borrow food off of. Pizza would be amazing...actually any food would be amazing. Thanks so much!!! :3
0	I've been feeling pretty crummy all weekend.. 8 of my friends left on a trip to Japan, and the weather here hasn't been at all great. I just got a job, but I work from home, and now that it's summer, everyone at my house is gone but me. I'm definitely not used to being alone so much. Needless to say, it's all brought my mood down.  I've never done anything like this pizza act before, but it would definitely make my week if someone would send over a cheese and pesto pizza or something.
1	So here's the deal:  I didn't know my college had shortened dinner hours on Sunday (only been here a week!) and was so busy catching up on work for my Comp Sci class that I missed eating.  Every place to eat on campus is closed early and I'm on a campus just far enough from town to make walking for food slightly dangerous.  I'm going to be up late programming and I'm starting to get really, really hungry...    In exchange I can offer an Android app in which you draw doodles on a cat face. [Screenshot](http://imgur.com/zuURi)  I'm in MA, by the way :) 
0	So today I've had the worst day ever basically. This morning me and my girlfriend got into a huge fight, and she left me for who knows how long. Not to mention I lost my job a week ago or so. I just ran out of trees (yes i am an ent) and the entire town is dry at the moment (I live in orlando). I'm also running really low on money, and don't have any income coming in any time soon, seeing as I just lost my job. On top of all of this, my two bestfriends have been total douchebags lately, and we were supposed to go get cici's pizza later today (it's only 5 bucks) but they both bailed on me. This has been the 5th time in the past few weeks that they've ditched me, for no reason at all. Anyways, if any of you redditors would be kind enough to send a guy a pizza now, I would really appreciate it
1	The husband and I don't get paid until Friday, and we don't have anything to cook up for dinner tonight. We would greatly appreciate some pizza. The only place we have out here is Pizza Hut.   Edit: I'm assuming that my request will go unnoticed. That's okay though. It didn't hurt to try.
0	(Los Angeles)  Hey all, I'm running low on food and money until my payday next week and I could really use a pizza to help tide me over. July is tough for getting work but August is supposed to be better for me, I'd like to return the favor when I can.  Closest Pizza place is a Dominos  Thanks
0	Is anyone out there kind enough to help me out? I started a new job Monday (in this day and age, I consider this a win) but won't get paid until the 15th. Spent all my graduation money on the deposit for my apartment near work. I am hungry and can show my pathetic empty fridge and equally pathetic bank account with $1.97 in it. Just throwing this out there if anyone has the heart to help a dude out. If so, I promise to help out another in need on the 15th when I receive my paycheck. Thanks for reading anyway.
1	Okay, so I'm going to try to keep this short, and stay with me because it really is a series of slightly unrelated events that landed me in my situation. Sometime on Sunday, my Xbox Live account was stolen, and almost $140 dollars worth of Xbox Live points were charged to my debit card. I called Xbox and got help getting a claim filed as soon as I realized. THEY said it would take 25 days, and I should contact my bank if I want a speedier return of my precious monies. They also said my Xbox live account would remain suspended until their investigation was complete.  Today after work, I did so, getting another fraud case opened by my bank. The banker said, or so I thought, that my card would be closed **in** 5-7 days. Mission accomplished, I head to the grocery story to buy something for dinner.     I had my food items rounded up and checked out, when BAM! My card was declined. Okay... maybe they went ahead and turned it off for purchases. No worries, my bank is across the street, and while they may be closed, they have an ATM.    Maybe you see where this is going...    OM NOM NOM went the ATM, gobbling my debit card and spitting out a mere slip of paper in its stead- in essence it said "this is **our** card now, criminal."    So that's it. No entertainment (by way of online video games), no food (by way of the cancelled card), and not even a way to get money (by way of the gluttonous automatic teller machine) until sometime tomorrow when I can physically walk into my bank and withdraw the cash from their electronic grasp. 
0	North Georgia Area here! Car was hit by a lady that ran a red light. Her husband was a cop.. Knew the cop at the scene... No witnesses stopped and i was out of luck. Im still trying to get in touch with someone that saw the wreck. Till then, i am for all intents and purposes broke till i know if i need to buy a whole new car or not...  
0	Yeah no sob stories haha, it's just my birthday and there's nothing better than being bought drinks than being bought drinks AFTER EATING FREE PIZZA!   Hahaha, anyway, I hope all of us have a good weekend and anyone who's down on their luck, I hope things get better!
1	Help any others that NEED pizza first, but I am hardcore craving a 'za and it would make my week. I will be paying it forward with my paycheck next week as well :D Thanks for your consideration!~
1	So my family has been running on pretty much 99 cent meals for the past few months due to being a few months behind on our mortgage.   I doubt I'm the only one here sick of the grind of ramen and Chef Boyardee grind, and I would love to surprise these guys with a pizza tonight :) Anyone willing to help out?  We're in central MA :D
0	So, I'm a fool and forgot my wallet. I'm alone at the office terminating Cat5e cable for the next (at least) 8 hours, and I'm hungry!  Anyone willing to help out? I promise to pay it back at least twice when I get get home tonight, and if its too late, tomorrow during the day!
0	Very hungry, very poor. Will pay forward next week after being paid. Charleston SC, 29424 300 Meeting Street, apt. 2a. 
0	I'm In Toronto,On. Looking for pizza from pizza pizza. Peace&amp;Love.
0	Broke until Sunday, no food, no money, (all of what we did have went to our babies! [dogs, cat, snake...]) sitting at work and hungry as fuuuuh. We are broke as hell and craving some 'zaa. If someone would be kind enough to get us a pizza from Papa Johns or Dominos or Pizza Hut, (our favourites!!!) or anywhere really! we would be forever indebted to RAOP and on Sunday, when we get paid, we would totally pay back the favor to another in need!!! Thanks so much!! 
0	I don't want to water fast for a week. My stomach hurts and I'm not going to have any money for at least a week. I work hard as a freelance writer every day but wages are 1-2 pennies a word. When rent is $600 and I earn $1,000 in a month, that doesn't pan out for insurance, food and the other responsibilities of life. I have no insurance now, nor do I have my car inspected. Poor is an understatement. I'm days away from being homeless.
0	My wife and I are having our 2nd anniversry and we've been eating Ramon for the last week. A pizza sure would make things aLOT better. 
0	We have an abundance of beer and we have starcraft but we dont have pizza so if we continue to drink at this rate we will surely pass out and stop playing starcraft, if we get pizza we will be able to continue playing starcraft :) 
0	We've been sick for a few days, and am pretty tired of eating soup, and kind of want to spoil ourselves
0	Hi, I had surgery three months ago to reconstruct my acl and meniscus. Because of the physical nature of my job I have been unable to work for the past three months although I have started back up this week past week so hooray for that. We do have insurance to pay much of the bills for which I am thankful, but the bills we have had to pay have wiped us out and put us in debt. No money in the bank account until Friday when my husband gets paid and in the meantime no food in the pantry but rice and beans which we've been eating every single night this week. I've never asked for assistance before and feel slightly unworthy when there are people with no food in their pantry out there. Still, if anyone can spare us a pizza tonight we'd be very grateful. We're vegetarians so please no meat. I will be happy to pay the pizza forward next month when I get my first paycheck. Thank you.
1	Since this is the interwebs and my sincere story could be nothing more than a grand facade to gain free grinds, I can offer nothing more than the hopeful ideation on your part that I am indeed in need of some savory cheesy, saucy laden goodness. I will save my sad-story for my own self when i cry myself to sleep tonight.  It will keep my recently low-spirits to rejuvenate in the fact that the world is not in fact filled with greedy corporate douche-bags who seek to crush me under their boot. Tomorrow is another day, but tonight a pizza will bring me temporary shelter from the bastards who seek to bring me down. or something.  In the hope of oven-baked goodness, I offer these haiku:  &gt; Stomach growling loud   &gt; Oh, Random Acts of Pizza   &gt; Deliver me hope    &gt; ~~Hearken~~ my pizza prayer.   &gt; Praise be to pepperoni!    &gt; Never anchovy!    ps. i'm in Honolulu and Pizza Hut is open late! :)  pss. it appears im a shitty haiku writer. dammit. :(  EDIT: Pizza received! 
0	The girlfriend and I were sitting at home and after repeatedly checking the cabinets she decided she'd rather be hungry than eat any more Ramen. Personally I could eat the stuff every day for another couple of months, but she's a little more high maintenance than I am. We're in between checks and had a ticket (10 over) recently that got rid of nearly all my disposable income. She'd deeply appreciate the gooey cheesy deliciousness and I really wouldn't mind myself! 
1	Long story short, got laid off, having to move back in with my parents this weekend (shitty situation, but at least they have food in the house). Only been eating ~4-5 meals a week lately, but having finished my last pack of saltine crackers, I'm clean out of food in my apartment. My paltry funds in my bank account have to go towards gas. A good large pizza could last me until I'm back at my parent's place with some food in 4 days. Figured I'd try this as a last resort. Thanks for reading.
0	Pretty much what what the title says. Grandpa was espically great to me, always gave until it hurt. Cannot afford dinner out for him so I would love to surprise him. 
0	Pizza-grantors of Reddit: my dad has made himself sick again by working all night long (typical) and my mom (the usual bringer of comfort food in times of trial) is away. I could make some half-assed trader joe's frozen stir fry, but he really loves a good, greasy pizza - which, coincidentally, we can only enjoy in the absence of the matriarch. Repayment will be in the form of one Spenserian Sonnet on the topic of your choice - Spenserian Sonnets being much more complicated and interesting than the boring Shakespeare variety. I am damn good at sonnets, by the way, in case you were wondering. Bonus love for breadsticks. 
0	I don't normally do this but my husband and I are in a bit of a financial pickle. I currently do not have a job, but I am looking. We're struggling  quite a bit, at the moment we genuinely only have $19.00 in our checking and $0.75 in our savings. We have to make that last for the next week until he gets paid. I haven't told him that I made this request, I think that it would really cheer him up if a kind person randomly pizzaed us. 
0	I've been filming my first short film/documentary all week and I finally just hit editing stage. I got so wrapped up in filming that now I have to edit 60+ minutes of footage in around 10. I'm dedicated into making this as good as possible.   Oh and the short documentary is about people's reaction to the word dick and their views on masculinity. If you guys are interested in seeing the finished product I will definitely post it up. 
1	It's just me tonight.. my kiddos are gone for the night and i would really like to enjoy a pizza i haven't been on in awhile due to very rude people so i'm just asking if you are not gonna say anything nice and you only want to talk negative then pass this up and don't post because you are wasting your time being negative. no sob story or nothing just hungry with a night to myself. thanks RAOP!! :)
0	I can't say that I've seen this before, but the moderators of /r/nfl have done a fantastic job for a long time.  They've kept the peace, created a subreddit that has gotten nothing but compliments on how it looks (one of the Reddit Admins swung by to give compliments) and have given an incredible amount of time and energy into the community and updating it.  I'm not sure if their are any regulars over there, but if there are I'm sure you know what a great job these guys have done.  I think offering these guys a pizza would be a great way to show thanks.  http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/about/moderators  There is a list of moderators.  I know off the top of my head that /u/napoleonBonerparts has had a huge role in making the sub looking the way it does, but there are many others that have done a fantastic job.  /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza I ask of you fine people to offer these moderators a pizza.  If you're not sure who to send one to, just ask or send a message, I'm sure they'll gladly direct you to a deserving moderator.  Thanks for your time, and if this is unorthodox, well, it is Random, isn't it?
1	Hello :)  My adorable puppy (pic - http://i.imgur.com/n8OC9.jpg ) and I kindly ask that someone please hook us up with a pizza today.  I'm broke, hungry, and I get paid tomorrow.    I will most certainly buy you or another redditor(your choice) a pizza tomorrow .  A pizza and a Dr. Pepper would totally rock my world, but a pizza alone would be just as wonderful.   In the time it has taken me to write this post, she's become much more demanding: http://i.imgur.com/2pY2v.jpg &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;   Please save me from her wrath and send us a Pizza!

We are getting back to stability, but hit a snag this weekend. Won't have grocery money till Tuesday at the earliest. The pantry is dangerously low on supplies and we won't be able to eat much tonight other than a few old tortillas.  Her and I would greatly appreciate your kindness and a hot meal. We are the type of people to pay such kindness forward. We don't need much, a pepperoni from Dominos would be like hitting the lottery right about now.  Thanks for any consideration you may give to our situation.   [BONUS CAT PIC AS A THANK YOU](http://imgur.com/7kf9avG) These are our two cats, Setzer and Reyes. We've also got a stray kitten that come to our back porch that we've been helping out by feeding and giving fresh water to her. We are planning on getting her shots and taking her in as one of our own as soon as we get back on our feet financially. 
0	Hi Reddit, My daughter and her friends spent the night after halloween. I would like to get them some pizza but I am out of a job and a single mother living at home. I know I just joined but It would be much appreciated if someone could gift me some pizza. I live in California, Thank You.

I live in Thomaston, CT (I'll give the rest in a personal message xP) I can't do much to thank you, I can try drawing a pokemon for you :D hmm...can't think of a way to express the please well enough so I'll just leave [this](http://images.intomobile.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/cat-please-pic.jpg) :3
0	Dear /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza  I come before you now as a humble man. I would like to think I am an honest man so I shall tell you an honest tale.   My name is Dave and I currently am working at a Homeless shelter for homeless youth in Seattle called ROOTS. I love working at ROOTS, I can sleep easily in the mornings (since I work throughout the nights) knowing that I am helping keeping 30 homeless youth off the streets and away from SNOWzilla's wrath as he stomps through Seattle.   SNOWzilla has ruined things here in Seattle. Because of the nature of the place I work at, someone MUST be on staff every night, and I have to work throughout the weekend and since the buses are closed? I must walk 5 miles in ice and snow to get to work.   Sadly though, I don't get paid very much. [(Bank Statement)](http://imgur.com/DvEeh) But that is the way of the world working for a homeless shelter. I haven't eaten in the last day and a half because of there being nothing in my kitchen [My fridge](http://imgur.com/05ffR) and stores being closed.  So I am asking you all, if you are willing, would be able to show a snowed-in man with no money some kindness? Even under these difficult times, and even if whether or not my ask for some kindness has no results, know that I have fun even when times are grim [I did it all for you, Reddit!](http://imgur.com/bhnxu)  I hope you can all find it in your hearts to give some kindness my way. I hope you all have a SAFE time as snowzilla causes havoc in everyone's regions and I live you with one last picture.  [Will you be my angel tonight??](http://imgur.com/vBBNm)
0	Just looking for a pizza. If anybody would be kind enough I'd appreciate it.. (: I'm in Eastern NC. You could use dominoes to order for me, it's right up my street(  Thanks in advance!
0	I am only a freshman in college in Georgia. I don't have a job so I don't have any money to buy pizza. I am applying to three places. If I am pizza'd or not I will either just give or PIF. 
1	My roommate and I are going to be up pretty late studying and working on homework.  She has to write a paper and I have an online exam tonight and two more later this week.  We both are strapped for cash and our dining court is closed on Sunday nights.   Thanks for reading, love you all RAoP!
1	Hi, I'm a new redditor(?). I'm sitting at my friend's house enjoying his A/C, and none of us have any money or food until Friday. He told me about this forum and said he never had any luck, but I think I'm luckier. I don't have a sad story or anything, we're just hungry and poor!  And I'll draw you an epic stick-figure battle if you get us some pizza!
0	AMAA, first time.
1	Starting a personalized songwriting business. It's going to turn into a community for songwriters and listeners to interact and coordinate the creation of a personalized song. Ideally, it's going to forever close the gap between the songwriter and listener, and give struggling, talented songwriters an opportunity to bring happiness to anyone in need of a song, for anything; but I've got a lot of work to do before then.  I probably won't have enough for rent this month, but my landlord's anniversary is coming up and I'm writing a song for his wife, in exchange for letting me be a week late. This leaves the unfortunate angle of food. I'm all out of bread.  Instead of just asking for a pizza, let's make this a symbiotic relationship. I will write a song about whatever you want. (Literally.) It will be catchy, awesome, and recorded in the form of a high quality mp3, in exchange for a delicious ham and pineapple pizza. I'll even submit it to you before you send a pizza, if you're wary about the deal.  If you're interested in hearing about my business, I'm funding Step 1 through kickstarter.com. [Here's the link to that](http://kck.st/pgKaih) Back me, or send it to a friend you think might be interested in a personalized song.   Otherwise, pizza for a song. Savvy?  If you want to hear some samples of what I do, check www.soundcloud.com/thallett (not sure why it's not linking...) out.  Thanks!  EDIT: **Thank you Czhunc for the pizza! It was fantastic. The offer is still open to anyone that wants it. I can always use a pizza. ** 
0	I'm skint have had to spend all my money on bills and really fancy pizza but cannot afford it. Instead of just plain out begging I thought i'd offer my drawing skills not saying they're any good though. Or i'll attempt to fullfill any other random things that I could possibly do?
0	Proof [Here] (http://imgur.com/JYsNU).  It's been a rough month honestly- I have my girlfriend in from out of town and literally have nothing but noodles to make for dinner (and as fantastic as garlic butter noodles go- they get old very VERY quickly). I'd love it if someone could get us a pizza- I don't have any cash coming in until late next week and it would be an excellent birthday present. 
0	I'm in San Ramon, California!   (I'm also vegetarian so a regular cheese pizza would be ok!)
0	when we found out our roomate wasnt paying the bills we gave her money for, we asked her to leave, she stole every dime we had. sold stuff and bills are all paid, but its ramen for a cpl weeks. coud really use a reminder there are good helpfull people in the world
1	Today is our 4th wedding anniversary! We don't get paid until next Friday and the money we had set aside for a nice dinner tonight begrudgingly went to various bills and gas in the last few days. She thought this subreddit was an awesome idea when I told her about it and I'd love to surprise her with pizza as opposed to the now planned spaghetti. We're in Florida, btw.  edit: [Pizza received!](http://i.imgur.com/5dcGb.jpg) My wife went from confused to angry to amazed hilariously fast. Thanks to MsFit for making our anniversary dinner delicious and awesome.
1	I've been staying with my cousin for a few days. I'm broke and have been running off the very minimum. I would feel wrong about taking from his cupboard, as it is nearly empty as well. Perhaps we could both appreciate some pizza.
0	Im 20 years old and living on my own in Texas. i work a crappy job for crappy pay. i finally saved just enough for this class so i can take it and make something of myself, because living like this is making me depressed to the point of mental breakdown. I live on ramen breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I gave my girlfriend my last pack this morning for her lunch at college. If there is anyone kind enough to help out I Promise that friday when i get that paycheck i will return the favor. i never ask anything from anyone unless i really need it but when i do, i always repay my debts.
0	I'm in the middle of moving and have one more day before finals week starts. It's safe to say I'm going a little stir crazy. But mostly I would just really love a simple old pepperoni pizza. I've responded to a few offers and haven't had any responses. I PROMISE to pay it forward when I get moved in back home! Any one want to help a girl out? I would be forever in your debt! I cannot tell you how much it would mean to me.
0	First time caller, long time listener. Hurricane Irene laid down some serious butt-hurt in good old colonial Williamsburg: A tree fell on our friends house, our basement flooded, and best of all, we've been without power since Saturday, and the electric company says it'll probably be back on... by Friday. So we basically had to cook all our room temperature meat that was in the freezer and hand it out to friends. Now we have no food, no power, and can't afford to eat out for every meal. We're just some poor college guys in a shitty situation, and could really use a RAoP.
0	My best friend broke his ankle, and i would like to see if anyone out there cares to help me get him dinner, as he is using all of his cash on medical expenses, and He cannot work, due to not being able to stand. If needed, i can give a picture as proof. To anyone that reads this, this is NOT for me, and i would really appreciate the help :]  EDIT: North Texas. Sorry :]
0	Just an average engineering student doing the full load summer class thing. My food stores have been reduced to a few cans of vegetables, oatmeal, and coffee. I've had a pretty rough week and could use some pizza + faith in humanity to help me power through finals this week. If anyone out there is kind enough to indulge me I would be very grateful. :)  Oh yeah, I'm in northern Minnesota
0	[Any kind] Still broke sadly start work on Monday, want to Celebrate =]
0	We just moved to the area, and as a result of putting down a huge deposit on our new home and getting in a recent accident, and my wife starting a new job that turned out to be the opposite of what she was told, we are broke and stressed. She just texted me and said she really would like some pizza and wine for dinner tonight just to relax her nerves, but we don't have enough right now to afford either.   I really want to give her a break tonight, she does so much for us and she really deserves something to make her feel better after a long and stressful week. Thanks!  EDIT: We have a Pizza Hut nearby, so feel free to use a Pizza Hut ecard: https://pizzahut.cashstar.com/gift-card/buy/?ref=ph1 
0	I was kicked out of my house a week ago and my girlfriend broke up with me a few nights ago. I'm sitting in my friend's house with not much to do and would love to go on a walk to pick up a pizza for us to eat tonight.
0	Hello there! My family and I have kind of hit on hard times, though things will be looking up next week. And a pizza would really be awesome, considering we've been on a diet of ramen for a couple of days now.   More than willing to pay it forward next week when we get some money coming in. 
0	I've been struggling financially since I got out of school and so long story short, I don't get to eat as often as I probably should and someone I know pointed me to this page. It'd be lovely and much appreciated if someone could help me out with a pizza tonight.   Thanks (:
0	Every day I wake up and think, "It's a new day!!" My positivity makes it to the office. I sit down, start working on optimizing our IT environment, check in with a colleague or supervisor, then remember, "NO ONE GIVES A FUCK." The day proceeds to beat that sentiment into me, as well as "nothing you do matters because it will never see the light of day." I waste more and more time on reddit, facebook, forums, whatever as the day goes by. Every time I manage to convince myself to work on something, I just get reminded by someone or some process that it's all fucking pointless busy work to distract me from the fact that this is not the job I interviewed for. By the time 5:00 rolls around, all I can do is shuffle home with that -_- look on my face and fall into yet another chair until it's time to sleep and repeat the same scenario the next day.  I would love something happy and unexpected to happen to me, but as we all know "no one gives a fuck."  Location: Texas
0	In addition to getting my wallet stolen over the weekend, I miss living somewhere I can afford to eat a pizza. It would be really super if there was a generous heart out there! :)
0	hey guys:  I love this sub. I think it's great. (Except the sob stories. I miss when this place was fun!) Anywho, I've given a pizza out before so thought I would try my luck at getting one. My friend, who lives an hour away and our schedules do not let us see each other too much, decided to come down and visit me for the night! I would love to be able to be a good host and order her a pizza to go with some beer!  Again, no sob story. Just looking to share a pizza with an old friend :)
1	I am a 22 year old man with a job that doesn't pay extremely well and does not offer insurance.  A full hospital visit is not an option for me financially, so my only options are walk in clinics.  I recently started feeling some severe abdominal pain and ended up going to the clinic two times before it was determined I had a blockage.  I am happy to be feeling much better, but that broke me and I have officially run out of money for food.  I would appreciate a pizza today more than you know.  I would be happy to buy someone in need a pizza this Friday once I get my paycheck.  Thank you 
0	Hey there guys I was just flicking through random subreddits and I stumbled on this! Well you probably get starving students all the time I guess. I'm a second year at Otago uni but I'm still only 17, meaning I live on the unsupported child benefit instead of the Student Allowance. After rent and power I have 70$ per week to live on (that's NZD too); the thing is I brought two 16$ posters for my room in my new flat (kinda a mistake) and now I'm kinda starving. Been eating nothing but noodles and these cheap (disgusting) beef patties all week.   So yeah I'd appreciate a pizza SO MUCH! I'd be willing to post a funny pic or whatever if that's what people usually do here? cheers guys!
0	I'm not going to come up with some sob story, I'm not going to make you feel bad for me.  I'm a guy at work, hungry for pizza, and have no cash. I packed a lunch, but I dropped it on the floor and now am underfed. Not like I'm starving or anything, I had a few snacks. I would just really like a small pizza.   Any takers for an honest hungry guy?
0	I am a broke ass college student (senior at Kennesaw State) and I won't be getting any money until the end of January. I'll probably be eating at the local shelter for the rest of the month. Would really just enjoy some good hot food tonight so that 2012 doesn't have to go out miserably in hunger. Thanks. Happy New Year! I hope 2013 brings great things to all you wonderful people.
1	Howdy r/RAOP! Just recently moved down to Saint Petersburg here in Florida; job hunting has been pretty rough, and I can think of nothing else but a pizza to really cheer me up and do the trick :)  I promise with my first paycheck to pass the favor on!
0	Is there any chance someone could help me out with dinner tonight? I am a broke college kid working on a chunk of my thesis as well as two other assignments for midterm week from now until like...at least the next 8 hours. I would be forever grateful, thanks! 
0	Tautological nom.
0	just having hard times, really want a cheese pizza.
0	Just started my first semester of college after living on my own for the fall, and man, have I gotten some perspective. I have money in the bank but no atm card (and it's sunday, oops) - had to borrow money yesterday for the first time since moving out, but I spent it on other necessities. Wasn't thinking about food for the rest of the weekend. :( Anyway, I'm going to be moving back in with my parents within the next few weeks, at which point I'll have much less financial obligation and would love to participate in a Random Act of Pizza. :) If this reaches anybody willing to help out, I'd be much obliged. If not, I'll see you guys around... keep up the great work!

1	I picked the lights.  I've had some unforeseen costs pop up and I have $20 to my name until next Friday.  There is a Pizza Hut and a Dominos close to me.  If anyone could help I'm starving and I'll pay it forward in a week.  Thanks ^__^
0	My whole life is going wrong and there is nothing I can do to make it better. There is way too many bad things going on right now ad I can't stop it. Would someone be so kind as to raise my hopes up a little and gift me a pizza? I will gladly repay the favor when I get some money next week. Thank you for reading this and god bless you. I live in Katy, Texas
0	All of our small money went to textbooks and rent. All we ask is a small pizza advance and we'd gladly give back on Friday. $10 could go a long way for us!
0	Hi all, I am a broke uni student studying for exams. I have a buy one get one free code (so I have lunch and dinner for tomorrow) for domino's as well. I will pay it back when I Get the chance. Thanks!
0	I've toyed with asking for a pizza, but i've had some help from friends and family these past weeks, but going on 2 interviews and not landing the job has really kicked me down a notch.  I also worried about tipping the driver, how does that work if someone donates a card? I wouldn't want a pizza if it meant stiffing the delivery guy...
1	As the title says. I am broke until Thursday night. If you can help awesome if not no biggie. Look out I will be buying pizza on Thursday anyway!
0	Hey, i'm new to this but my friend just told me about this site. I have just moved to Centralia and got my apartment. I spent all my money for rent and have no money until the 12th. It'd be highly appreciated if someone would be able buy me a Large Pepperoni Pizza from Dominos and I will be able to pay you back. Please and thank you.
0	I'm 9 months pregnant, very tired, and very uncomfortable.  I'm craving a pizza really badly tonight, but am broke at the moment.  If anyone's feeling generous tonight I would appreciate it so much!  Thanks! http://i.imgur.com/E8mad.jpg
0	Buy me a cheese pizza?
1	I'm not starving - I'm just hungry, and ramen's no longer cutting it (meat would be great, y'know?).  Direct deposit goes through at midnight, but by then, everything is closed in the area (Pizza Hut, Papa Johns and Donato's). Anyone feel like helping a couple of people out?  
0	Just spent my last $10 on food for my fish, and only have $1.92 in my bank account until Friday at midnight. If anyone can spare a pizza pie today, I will gladly pie it forward on Friday when I get paid. 
0	Scumbag Jackson Hewitt was supposed to have our tax return back for us already but they don't. we are hungry and would enjoy some tasty pizza!
0	Dear Sir,    Please to you very much this fine day, blessed be your Niel Degrass Tyson, I am very sick and in the hospital for many weeks. I need you to send me a pizza immediately this day to cure and pay for my many necissary surgjeris. Please do act now! Please include the full name, the 16 digit credit card information, expiration. Many thanks to you and the midnight pork whales and your god sagan. Thanks you and please hurry
0	I just lost my job last week and my bank account is negative, my wife took the kids and went to visit her mom in a different state and I would really love a sausage pizza right about now. I can trade someone Civilization 4 on steam for it if that's what you want.
0	Would adore a pizza this evening, haven't had any lunch and I do not think I can face plain pasta or rice for the 4th day in a row.  I have exactly enough money for bus fare to work tomorrow and Wednesday and that it, all my spending for the past 2 weeks has been calculated exactly so obviously no frivolous pizza buying! Would love a pizza whilst I pack up my room tonight ready to move back home at the weekend. (End of university)  I've wanted to buy someone on here a pizza for a while and I would love to do so (UK) on Thursday night! 
0	Just down on my luck, couple of rough things happened including losing my job.
0	Boyfriend broke up with me and There is nothing to eat at my house.
0	My gf of 4 years and I just broke up and i'm trying to do any random thing that might help slowly fill the void. Unfortunately I was unprepared for this and it has cost me quite a bit already. If someone could get me even just a small pizza to munch on while I continue to pack up her things from my room, i'd be eternally grateful and return the favor to either you or some other unlucky pizza redditor come pay day.
0	Been eating ramen the past few days seeing if this would work, would truly be appreciated.   
0	I love you guys.  This is one the coolest thing I have ever heard of.
0	We still want pizza same as yesterday..we weren't successful yesterday..managed to get a few laughs, but that was it...pizza only this time, no drama, thx   EDIT: Thank you for your votes, I appreciate them, food stamps come in on Sunday, just trying to supplement what food we have left, can only eat Mac &amp; Cheese and Ramen so many days before getting sick of it.

1	The government screwed up and now we have to wait over a month for them to refile and reestablish my claim.  There is no way to expedite this at all, in spite of the fact that it is their mistake.  We have 2 girls (9 and 7) and 3 boys (5,3, 2months).  My wife had to be taken by ambulance to the hospital last week for emergency gall bladder removal surgery and we are feeling a bit beat on at the moment.  This would be a humungous pick-us-up.  I am happy to provide any verification you need.  Thanks in advance.  **EDIT: http://imgur.com/4FXXT Thank you so much Gama-Go!**
0	Just moved into a new apartment with my GF and we've spent all our monies on the moving truck, ridiculous deposits, down payments, and other 'security' fees. Payday is a few days away but we're really craving a good pizza. Can Reddit help us settle in tonight?
0	Just finished up the last of my classes and running low on funds. Looking for full time employment now that summer started to support myself.  In the mean time I am getting a bit hungry and could use a pizza,  anything would do. I made a throw away so my friends/family don't know my financial situation at the moment because I really hate asking for handouts. Im willing to provide my actual account via pm and repay the favor to you or set uo my own offer once I'm working full time.  Thank you for your timw
0	I am grateful for what I do have but eating bologna for 2 months gets to a person. I have copd and have trouble getting around. If anyone is kind enough to help out I would appreciate it. I am a widow and live alone with my pup.
1	Just found out I got a job I just interviewed for but I don't get paid for another 2 weeks. My wife and I have been on brown rice and dry cereal for a while now. Anyone willing to get us a medium or large pepperoni pizza would be appreciated. Once I get my first check I will kindly repay the favor.   Edit: Pizza already received and currently being enjoyed. Many thanks godbless this fucking site. I love you guys.
1	I'm a full time student that also works full time, which means I never get time off! I'm enjoying the first day off I've had in over 3 months, but I have no food in the fridge and I don't get paid til wed! I'd be so grateful for a pizza right now &lt;3&lt;3
0	Out of cash, out of food. No fun. Remembered my buddy mentioning this RAoP thing, figured I'd give it a shot.
0	Wages were supposed to be in my bank account this morning, they weren't. I am very hungry. I am happy to pay it back or forward when I get paid. Proof: http://i.imgur.com/UtcSy.jpg
0	I'm off work and uni with glandular fever which has caused badly swollen glands and is making me look like the elephant woman (can prove with pictures) :( I'm craving a pizza and just can't afford one right now, got no food in the house and too tired to get out of bed to walk and get something to eat.  Edit: Will try pay it forward when I can!
1	I'm at the library right (sigh) now and probably will be all night until my final at 8:45am tomorrow. I barely have money to buy food from my college, but a pizza would go a long way in helping me concentrate for this final. I will pay it back once I have get money it to my account.   Edit: Just looked at my title *nods in shame* 
0	Long story short: six fish sticks and less than half a head of iceberg between the two of us (my brother and I) in the fridge until friday morning. Ends are being met, but food is at the bottom of the list. lil help? I can't say I can offer anything in return, other than mounds of appreciation...well no wait, if you can think of something i can do in return, ill try my best to fulfill. more than willing to pay it forward, but if you can think of something else i can do, let me know. thanks :)
1	my family and i have no food for tonight i was wondering if anyone would be willing to offer
1	I don't even know if this is allowed, because I technically don't want pizza. I do want chocolate lava cake from dominos.   I was due with my husband and I's daughter last Friday. The same day, I had to take my husband to the airport for a week of training. We tried so hard to get out of it, but that's the life in the military.  I honestly could get up and bake some cookies or something, but I am trying to stay in a reclined position. I'm trying to get my contractions to slow down until my husband gets home tomorrow night.  
1	Hello Reddit.  I lost my job a couple weeks ago and my girlfriend and I are getting tired of Ramen Noodles.  We could REALLY go for a pizza...and as the title says...I'll draw you a thank you comic!  Thank you for your kindness and possible blessing of pizza.
0	My brother is home from college and we would appreciate it. 
0	i got fired from my job around 2 months ago and now im really broke and trying to get some food.  im a new redditor in kansas city metro (technically in prairie village) im watching my moms house and she bought no food and would love for a friendly person to provide pizza.  will reciprocate for pizza provider at some future date :D 
0	I made a request yesterday someone was willing to help me out but it required driving which I do not own a car, If someone is able to help someone else I will return the favor in few days (Thurs) roommate bailed leaving me to cover the whole rent and utilities (ran me broke and had to even borrow money) thanks redditors 
0	Financial Aid ran out a few month's back, been borrowing money and selling everything I own just to make ends meet. Not trying to give you a sob story cause life isn't all that bad, I mean hey I graduate next month and Im healthy so im pretty happy about that. I just wish I could afford something to eat, let alone a pizza. Thank you for listening 
0	I recently graduated from college, moved to a new city then had my bank account hacked by some motherfucker in England. I have literally no money and I don't know what to do. I owe a bunch but I have nothing. I'm looking for a job and I was expecting to find something more than minimum wage after getting a BA but lo and behold that has not happened. Anyways, I'm hungry and cold and homeless. I'm couch surfing and I'd love some food. Here's the difficult part, I'm vegan. I hate to be a beggar and a chooser, but I'd prefer a vegan pizza. The upshot of that is that I'm around Berkeley, California. That said, I'm willing to take whatever, I'm getting hungry enough that my morals are fading. PM me if you're willing to help. Thanks!
0	my recently ex boyfriend stole my purse from my apartment. seeing as i live paycheck to paycheck and i don't get paid for another week and a half, i have no way to pay for anything. i have nothing in the bank, and until i get new credit cards (i reported them stolen), i can't even buy groceries this week.   when i get paid, i can be sure to pay back/pay forward any kind of help anyone here could help me with. thanks for reading and thank all of you for what you do.  zoe
0	So I got laid off from my job 2 weeks ago and thought I would find something by now. I've had some interviews, but still waiting to hear from some places i've had very good interviews with. I'm totally broke. I think I might just have exactly $15 in my bank account. I'm hungry and ramen is killing me now. What money I had went to my cat's fancy food (One has a urinary problem thus both have to eat the same food because the one is a food lurker)  If anyone could help supply me with a couple days worth of any awesome pizza, me love you long time
0	My German teacher told me about this site yesterday and it took some time to actually find it. I am 17 and want to show my 'rents I appreciate them. My mom is great, but this is mostly for my step dad who is like a real father to me. I just found out that he has been making payments so i can go on a trip to germany with my class this Summer. We don't have that kind of money. i don't have a job 'cause my mom wants me to just worry about school and keeping my grades up. I would love to give them pizza for dinner. If anyone wants to help, i would be greatful. I read everything and if someone can just make sure i do the verification thing right, i would appreciate it. We have 4 ppl in my house, my 'rents and me and 11 year old sister. thanks.
0	This morning for breakfast, I consumed essentially what was left of my actual food. I had some cheese, bacon, a hamburger bun, and a salad. Currently, I'm training for my new job and am finding it hard to focus without bringing lunch for my very full day. If I had a nice, hot, gooey pizza for dinner and lunch tomorrow, I'd be set. Pizza Hut has nice deals going on. Buy me a pizza and I will trade you a body/hygiene/cosmetic product from my future store (You can message me if you want to know what store that is, but it is a really awesome one). Thank you.
1	Fulfilled! Thank you Paisley8827! From the bottom of our hearts (and bellies)!  The money: We've got a negative bank account, my wife is due two payments from her company (she's a freelancer for a subsidiary of Penguin Books), and both of our parents have already helped us financially. We've got a 2nd account with about 30 bucks in it to last us until Tuesday.   If it were just she and I, we could scrounge. We've both been hungry before. But it isn't just us, we've got an eternally hungry 7year old, and a 1 year old who might be the worlds largest importer of milk.  I know it reads like a sob story, but it isn't. Normally things are good, and they'll be good again soon, but right now the stress of how to feed everyone is very, very taxing. Hell, starting Monday I'll be making my twice-a-week trips to the local Talecris Plasma center for the extra cash.  So, all that being said, would someone be willing to help us out tonight?  edit: We're in Pensacola, Fl for what it's worth.
0	Back at school, but both school and my job don't start for another week. Not enough money for heat, so I've been  crashing at my friend's girlfriend's house. I would love a hot meal, if someone felt like sharing.   EDIT: I have been generously taken care of by the enigmatic jetboyterp. If you were thinking about helping, please send your money to another redditor in need!
0	I'm just looking for a pizza tonight since it's the one night I worked a day shift instead of closing, and I decided to stay in so that I could get some decent sleep. Thanks!
1	I'm at an internship right now and not only do I get paid diddly squat, but I don't get paid till next week. I have no money and no food until next week. I would much appreciate a little kindness and as soon as I get paid, it's pizza for everyone! well maybe not everyone...  I hate asking for favors, but I need a little help here...
1	Hello Reddit, Title is pretty self explanatory, My wife just gave birth to a future Redditor We are stuck in the Hospital and she is hungry for some pie.   [Say hello to Anah!](http://i302.photobucket.com/albums/nn91/potebarski/New%20baby/DSC05975.jpg)
0	My day off this week, feeling hungry and a little strange. I would love a pizza   While I clean my house and think about my future. 
1	No pizza in the wilderness. I'd love one before I left. I'm from CNY. 
0	i dunno how to beg for pizza. my brother and i are sitting inside, i have some work to do in a couple hours which i will be getting a check for, but i can't cash it. tomorrow I should have worked enough to get my bank account up to zero dollars. i don't have a credit card, so the only way I could really pay it forward is by feeding the local vagrants. not having credit sucks, and mom doesn't get paid til friday. it's sad, but i'll have you know the reason i'm sitting here hungry is because I do favors for people and not all of them are able to express their gratitude in the form of money. totally missed out on the free artisan pizza, that would have been epic.   i'm in New Orleans area. my skitzo brother will likely record a rap for you which you can post if u like it. and i'll upvote it.   edit: http://slickdeals.net/forums/showthread.php?t=3350702  also, have a $10 iTunes giftcard for you as well, in the spirit of randomness i'll just post it here in a little while.    XXTSPXBMBTQ3S32M   that's the iTunes code, I'm not hungry I had a booger and fingernail pasta. my bro could still use the pizza and maybe a pack of cigs. I'll delete this post later today... gotta head back over to this lady's house I think she has a rootkit. fml.
1	**Miami, FL**  I've never tried this RaoP before, but I thought I'd give it a shot. I've had a shitty week at work, burnt myself trying to cook, and in the end I couldn't really eat it. Here's some [proof](http://i.imgur.com/TeGji0E.jpg).  A small pan pizza from Domino's sounds amazing right now, but I won't be picky! I'll even pick up at the store to save on the delivery fee.  Thanks in advance!  --- DJ
0	EDIT: Before pics are [here](http://imgur.com/a/DHvJ4).
0	Her name is Chinadoll and she apparently had an enormous hairball stuck in her intestines.  We had taken her to the emergency vet clinic and they did a bunch of tests on her and all of them were really expensive, and then they told us that she would need surgery (which was $2000).  She is home and getting back to being her usual rambunctious self, but of course she should be lying down and recuperating.  We're all dead tired due to sleepless nights of waiting around at the clinic and worrying about her, of course, and could really go for some pizza.  As for the story behind Chinadoll, she is a huge, fluffy, grey cat.  She is sometimes very sweet and loving but usually cruel, stubborn, and dominating.  She is always far smarter than us, very energetic, and very beautiful.  She has been described as a "probability cloud of evil".  As a kitten, she was rescued from being hanged by some young assholes.  My SO and I love our four cats as our children, and the other two people in our house see them as family, too.  If you want to treat us to pizza, there are four people here and we like Cottage Inn.  Other pizza places would be fine, though.  An e-gift card would be the best for this, I think.  Here are some photos of Chinadoll: http://imgur.com/a/AMKC6  Thank you for reading, kind Redditors!  
1	I've been unemployed but working odd jobs. I worked a job yesterday which I thought paid up front - it did not. Now I'm sitting at home dreaming of pizza (literally, I took a nap and dreamt there was pizza in my fridge, but woke up to nothing but leftover pasta). Will pay forward when I get a chance!
0	I'm kind of curious to see if someone does respond. I have less that $20 in my bank account, and I'm stuck at work until Midnight. Anything would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!
0	Due to shitty circumstances and misinformation I missed dinner at the dining hall tonight.  The express option was not available due to "spring cleaning".  Me and twelve other unhappy campers got shafted.....  Also, it was wing night at the express dinner.....  Double wut-ze-fuck....  Anywho, I realized that I also have like $3.83 in my bank account until tomo, so if someone would like help me out that would be amazing!! :)))))
0	UK - I don't want to sound like i'm begging but i live in the uk and there is a few days now before i can go home. I have ran out of food and i am living off bread. After the exams i am just fed up and want to go home. I do not even need a full pizza, a kebab would even be most appreciated right now. Thanks anyone if you can help.  As a side note: i did not know whether to put this worldwide or not. I have never done this before and if i paid for it then i can pay with paypal. If others do then i guess it would be uk only.
0	Just passed the last check ride in order to get my License next week, Big day! anyway it's all paid for through the military, so I don't have a job/money to by my own Pizza. if your in Bend or want to come to Bend I will give you a ride in a helicopter, for free.
0	I'm very hungry right at the moment and I have nothing to eat in the refrigerator but ice and I need some pizza to eat. I'm not like "homeless starving" but I'm just damn hungry. So can someone here mind giving me some pizza? 
0	Mwaahhh thanks. (WA)
0	I am a legit redditor with a few jobs and a good set of morals and values. This last couple weeks have been very tough...all the money I made went to pay bills, rent, getting my driver's license back and the  state government took money from my account to repay for past due state taxes. I am very hungry and desperate please help. No family here in the US to help me and I feel bad asking friends for food money. Please help me and I will replay as soon as I get my money right. 
0	Need a pizza me my husband and our 4 year old are hungry no money till pay day nor any food in the house please help opps forgot to put clintonville wisconsin
1	Hi there! It's one of those super cold, super crappy, super lazy days where all you want to do is curl up and watch a movie. My car is awful in the snow (which has already turned to slush, which will probably freeze soon...) so going to the supermarket is out. I seem to be running low on supplies so a pizza would be absolutely fantastic. No sad story, no dilemma, just a cold lady who would like to indulge. 
1	hey guys! my friend and i are probably going to be up all night working on the final papers for our summer class and we'd love a study break. we're both the first people in our families to go to college (our parents are all immigrants) and we're at an Ivy League university on very, very generous financial aid. help us out, school is hard. ease our pain with pizza!
0	Hey all,   I come on here not really expecting anything but thought it might be worth a shot. I am currently so broke that there is no food in my house and I am at work for nine hours today with no food. I would kill for a pizza. If you want to help me out, let me know. :) 
0	Trying to save up money to go to make-up school and its been 6months since I have eaten a pizza. If I keep to my strict saving I will be able to enter my school by January!! Would love to taste the lovely stuff again. If anyone would like to help a Londoner out I would be very grateful. If I make it in the make-up world I will give you a free make over :)   
1	my moms monthly check doesnt come till tomorrow and theres no food to make at my house other than rice or toast, ive been makin watever i could find these last few days. i hav a nice family and were usually doin good on our own, but the bills this month were more than expected so we had to buy less food.
0	I don't really have a sad story or anything to tell, I'm just exhausted and forgot to get groceries.  I've been working my retail job for the last few days straight.  I got off my shift today and made the mistake of getting comfy.  I completely forgot to grab food before heading home.  Other than toasted bread and tap water, my options for dinner are moot.  If someone would be willing to save this tired man a trip out and order some Pizza in my place, you will have firmly restored the faith in humanity that being a retail servant has taken from me.
0	So I just lost my job after four weeks for 'not meeting sales targets.' I had hardly any training, and the boss fired me knowing full well I have a mortgage and kittens to look after. My car has a STOP light showing (Peugeot 207, fucking French shit.) and I have no money in my bank. I'm at my wits end. Please, help me.  Throwaway account.
0	I will be your friend. forever. and ever.  &lt;3
0	Blender is toast and I need to wallow in sorrow for a bit. Pizza would help with this.
1	After working my dead end job for two years I finally got separated because my boss did not want to work with me so I could go back to college. Much appreciated.
0	It would be much appreciated.
0	It's been hell these last two weeks, and prepping for finals has been kicking my ass. Due to the stress, I've been losing so much weight, I feel like I'm see through! I'm honestly willing to take anything you might want to throw at me, I just really want to wind down and take advantage of my last weekend before finals are slammed right into my face...which would rather be stuffed with pizza. 
1	Hey RAoP, first time post, I'm feeling desperate.  Money is really tight with me these past few months because I just moved to a new apartment just south of Bellevue. Which has managed to milk me dry with its first months rent and deposit, came out to about 1100 bucks.  (barely make 1k a month) I am, as a result, flat broke, and also haven't been able to eat for about 36 hours. My next paycheck also wont be here until next wednesday Dec, 6. If any good people are willing to spring for a pizza which would last me a few days, I would be entirely grateful!
0	Hey everyone, I'm about 2 months pregnant and im starving tonight. I dont get paid until the 1st in a couple days but I have zero food for tonight, not even some ramen noodles or bread. I'm literally out of everything. I was gonna go to a local church tomorrow to see if they could give me a couple of days worth of food but for tonight I have nothing to eat. If anyone could help me out with 1 hot pizza for tonight I'd be so happy, ty so much! 
0	My parents and I are on a gluten free diet (no flour/wheat - no pizza crust) and scraping toppings off just ain't my thing. Domino's is the only place in the area with a Gluten-free option, and it's pretty expensive. We would buy it ourselves, but our household is in a bit of a financial pickle. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks so much in advance!
1	Hello, I was informed about this site through someone. Both my roommate and I share funds and our bank account is at 4 dollars till Friday. We thought we would just be able to go without food till then but our rumbling tummies tell us other wise. If anyone would be kind enough to send a pizza our way we would greatly send someone a pizza once we get paid even tough our pay will be cut short being my roommate had taken a week off due to being sick . Thank you to anyone who is willing to help.
1	Okey Dokey... I requested a Pizza yesterday on account of being out of food. I did ask kind of late and did not get said pizza, my bad. I did not, however, go to bed hungry. It dawned on me that I had all the stuff for vegan fudge, I'm not vegan, or vegetarian, but I am pretty clever. Here's what I had for dinner.       3 cups sugar      1 1/2 cups water (use coconut, almond, or regular milk if you've got it)      2/3 cups of coco What you wanna do is boil the shit out of these 3 ingredients until they pass the "hard ball" test... What's that you ask? you just drizzle a little bit of the mixture into a bowl of cold water and if you can reach in and form a ball your mixture passed (Test frequently until you have the hang of making fudge)... Once your fudge passes the test turn off the heat and toss in a TSP of Vanilla and a Half a stick of butter if you've got it (I made mine with just sugar water and cocoa last night and it was still good). At this point you can toss stuff in your chocolate goo... Nuts, Raisins, those little cranberry raisin thingies... Ya know whatever, I like to dump a load of peanut butter in there when I have it. Super easy!      Anyway, I would like to eat real food tonight so if you can help out shoot me an email. Otherwise I'm eating fudge again. Could be worse... THANKS GUYS!
1	Today is my wife and my anniversary. While we have had a great day together and have enjoyed it, unfortunately there has been a little something missing. We haven't had a chance to treat ourselves today, (or this week, month, year) due to financial reasons. While we do have the 20 bucks for a pizza, it's literally our last and we can't justify spending it regardless of the day. The usual long list of financial, employment and medical hardships have gotten us where we are but that's not what we're here for. We're here to hopefully CELEBRATE our second wedding anniversary with the help from fellow redditors.  Oh ya, and my wife is 7 months pregnant so you know she's ready for a pizza! Pics and evidence [here](http://imgur.com/a/9SQRB) Our local (AND ONLY) pizza place that delivers to us can be found at [this](http://www.foxspizza.com/locations/stores.ep.html?STATE=Virginia&amp;x=10&amp;y=6) link (Ours is the Berryville location) 
0	Hey out there in pizza land.  We are a family of 6 with a 3 week old.  It is 100 degrees and we have no AC.  The baby has been crying because it is just too hot for him.  I can't possibly turn the stove on tonight, if we could get out of this house and go grab a pizza somewhere, all the kids would really appreciate it tremendously.  Thanks to all who inhabit this site!
0	I am a long time lurker, I enjoy reading and laughing at all the crazy posts on here. The reason for this request is my check still has not cleared and I got paid Friday, I can't do anything until tomorrow so for the night I have nothing to feed my children. I do my best and work my butt of for my little munchkins and I am real aggravated by this situation. I feel terrible, but I need help.
0	We could just really go for some pizza right now. Obviously, we are super broke. Although it's irrelevant, it's 23 degrees outside.  
0	I live in The Sacramento Area in California. My husband decided now is the time to cheat which is wonderful as I am pregnant so I have been reading this and it has made me both cry and smile as people are so kind here. I hate to ask but figure it is worth a try. Nothing to lose by taking the time to fill out a simple message, but I admit I am new to this. I have been lurking now for a year and finally broke down and made an account for advice.  So I will just put it out there, I am in the foothills so it is a half hour to get pizza but I will gladly make the drive if someone would help with the pie. I will be getting some financial help from my folks hopefully in the next few weeks and will pay it forward as soon as I can. If anyone can help me we have Round Table and Domino's or Mountain Mikes. I am not choosy :) Thank you for any help. I do have a verification code if that is helpful.  edit; Tried to edit for spacing it would not allow. My apologies. EDIT; Spaced correctly after being told how to do correctly! Thanks Nolanoscopy.

1	Hi folks. Can't believe I'm actually asking here.  I was let go 3 weeks ago (southern California), and my old employer still hasn't given me my final check. I'm fighting, but as a person without credit cards I'm finding eating difficult. The wife and I are being as frugal as possible, but we have barely eaten since Friday.  I always made great money, but I was let go after sinking my entire savings into moving across the country for this new job.  I'm just begging for a meaty pizza mostly for my wife (/u/curiouslittlealice). She is anemic, so although supplements are helping she's still having a lot of trouble with a diet of rice and ramen.  Thanks everyone. I feel so horrible asking but I just don't have any money to get her anything more iron heavy right now.
0	We're both broke. Her mom is out of town, my mom is someone I would rather not ever see again in life, all others are with their fams today. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
1	I've got a movie date tomorrow night (Wednesday 2/1) and he's ordering the movie I want to see via onDemand. I'd like to order us a big ol' pizza to snack on after a long day of class/work/meetings *but* I only have $4 in my account.  **I get paid on Friday and will offer 2 separate pizzas asap to pay it forward!**  I'm in the US and there's a Domino's only a block from his place. Any offers would be immensely appreciated and many good vibes and thanks will be sent!!  [edit] I also have great coupons for my area!! So I'd only need a small donation :)
0	If anyone's willing to hear me out, I'd love to surprise my kids tonight with a meal that will light up their faces. I'm a hard working single dad that cares a lot for his kids. I hope you can understand. Thanks in advance.
0	Unfortunately I don't get paid until Friday, but I have under a dollar in my bank account, no cash, and an empty fridge. I'm off to work until 7PM ET, but I just thought I'd throw this out there. Thanks for your time RAOP &lt;3

Will provide proof and something else (including but not limited to):  * Pictures of me enjoying said pizza.  - A hug/spoon if you are within hugging/spooning distance.  - I will draw anything you desire.  - I write radio commercials for an internship, will write one advertising your generous self.  &lt;3
0	I have posted in the food pantry to try and get some help for my mom and brothers, but I am asking if anyone could get them a pizza or two, they ran out of the food I gave them to eat while on a bus back to El Paso, yes, it wasn't much, but I was able to get them each a protein bar and a water for the trip, but money is so tight I am struggling myself but this is not for me just them please, they are my only concern. Mom and my brothers are good people but they fell on hard times and I didn't have the money to come home with them yet I know a pizza by itself won't solve their problems, but after a 24 hour bus trip from my home in California back to moms home in Texas, it would be a blessing and I am trying so hard to find a way to help them, I miss them so damn much. Well it is most likely too late to get a pizza for them this evening, but I still have faith, i talked to them and that made me happy, just wish i could do more right now. Please help me if you can. Nicole
0	Yea, there's nothing too it. I'm honestly just hungry and pizza is my favorite food in the world.  will be sure to return the favor asap  Maple ridge, BC, Canada
0	Hello Reddit,   I won't be getting any money until Wednesday and our fridge is bare. My wife and I would really appreciate a pizza if possible. I know others might need it more, but if possible we would really appreciate it. As soon as I land a job (2 prospects in the works) I would love to pay it forward of course. Anything to get a slice next to my name :P jk  Thanks Reddit and Redditors for all the laughs.   Edit:1 Thank you Gingaskunk! I will pay it forward as soon as I can!

1	Just spent almost $1600 on my car to get it through emissions in order to renew the registration, which expired yesterday and also replace the waterpump which went at the same time. Still need to wait until my next paycheck in order to afford to pay this year's car taxes and the renewal fee. I had to borrow money and use all of my check in order to cover it so far.  But the good news is, not only did I get a promotion at my full time job, I was also hired as a freelance on call artist for MAC Cosmetics, which pays MUCH more than what I earn at my full time job. Hopefully within the next two or three months I'll be in a place where I don't feel like I have to ask the internet for food and I can give away pizza like woah.  So this is kind of a desperately hungry/celebration pizza!  There's a Pizza Hut and Dominos that both deliver near me. I'd seriously be grateful. Thanks!

0	I have zero groceries anywhere in my house and I've been craving pizza for a week now.
0	Hey, guys i am at my girlfriends house and i wanna suprise her with a large pie. I would buy it but, currently we are saving up to move to Colorado in two months(so money is tight). Wondering if anyone could help us out?
0	I was referred here by a redditor I am good friends with on IRC. I am currently starting my own business, so I've been living paycheck to paycheck due to new expenses. I don't have any checks coming in until next week. I spent the last of my money to buy a bag of food for my dog so he doesn't go hungry. Any help would make the next couple days much less miserable.
0	My name is Victoria I reside in Great Lakes IL I currently have $1.19 in my account for me and my daughter until Tuesday morning, a counselor on base pointed me to this site, anything would definetly help me and my daughter. I definitely plan on paying it back to someone on Tuesday.
0	* 17 years old with Type 1 Diabetes  * Mom and her boyfriend are on potato diet  * Nothing but potatoes for a teenager to eat for dinner * Doesn't want another ounce of potato * Car in shop getting fixed * Can't leave   That's basically the jist of it. I've recently spoken to my mother about no longer participating in the diet, but she agreed that I must now cook for myself. Only problem is that there is nothing but potatoes, beets and carrots available for consumption for now.

0	I don't want a pity pizza, so I'll just list one awesome thing that's happened to me today and try and have an awesome moment pizza.  Loads of bad shit happening, deportation, ect. Really sad. Find a wallet on the street. Look inside. 800$+ dollars. Decide to steal it. Few minutes later, reconsider and take it to the bus station. Lady there looks inside and see's the $800, looks at me surprised, and gives me a smile. She asks for my name, and I say "Your friendly neighborhood Normalman." She laughs and wishes me a good day.  In Quebec, Canada, so I don't know how international pizza orders work, if it can't happen, no worries. Good day c:
0	I'm feeling pretty weak and hungry right now from donating blood at my school drive. A pizza would be AWWWWWESOME.
0	No sob stories, just college apps kicking my ass. Procrastination is my best friend, we have a lot of fun then I remember all the stuff (COLLEGE APPS) I SHOULD have been doing. So, now that I'm pulling an all nighter a snack, preferably a pizza would be sick! :] IN CA. 
1	I don't know if anyone will read this, or if there's anyone who will care. But, I've gotten to a point where I can't do anything but ask for help. My family and I are in dire need, and I just don't know what to do anymore. I've been homeless before, and had to do without, but I'm struggling at my last wits to hold on this time.   I just can't let my children go through that, and by the grace of God, a blessing will come. You see, I've spent my last just so my kids could eat something; no cash, no savings, no credit, nothing. I've applied for food stamps, but it will be nearly a week before we receive them. So, in the meantime, I don't know what we're going to do. I don't have a car or any transportation, for that matter, so I can't get to a food bank or pantry. Believe me, I've thought about it, but I'm literally stranded. We have no family out here.   My husband is out of work due to injury, and I've been out of work due to my health. We have been trying to make it by doing work for people online, like building websites, writing articles, building backlinks, and so on. It's been tough, however, because for every legit job we get, it seems someone else tries to get over on us. For the sake of our children, though, we push on.   I don't want to go into all the details publicly, but it's really hard for us these days. We're barely scraping by. We're just a day or two away from homelessness (you can PM for more info), and what's worse is that we can't get any help. We've tried, and been turned away. It's sad. When you need help, I mean really need it, you can't get it.   For the past couple of days, we've only had enough food for the kids to eat, so we've gone without. As long as they have what they need, we will be okay. They are what matters most to us, and so, we sacrifice for them. We don't get much sleep for worrying and trying to make enough money just to get by. Between the stress and worry, I'm surprised that we can even hold a thought.   I cry sometimes, a lot actually, and I wonder, if our efforts are in vain. It seems like everything is working against us, no matter how hard we push forward, we just can't stay ahead. It's wearing me down, that's for sure, but I know that our breakthrough is coming. Somehow, and someway, we are going to make it.   It's just so tiring to try, and try, and try, and not get anywhere. And what I've told you here is not the half of it. If anyone can help, I will give you the info (verification) that you need of our situation.   I'm just hoping, that at least tonight, someone can help us out. Pizza isn't much, but it's something. And I'll be thankful for it. It will help us to get through another tough night, just a little easier.     ---family of 7 from Irving, Texas (just after 8PM)   (had to repost to include -request- in the title, just following the rules)
0	To start things off, my birthday was March 7th. Last year i spent my birthday with my exgirlfriend. She brought me to a beach, then to a bar in seaside for food. We fought all day. This year i spent my whole birthday working in a sheet metal factory from 7-6pm. One friend smoked me up, then the rest of the night i spent smoking up all of my other "friends." My best friend didn't hit me up till 3am the next morning.  Now that i'm done being a little girl, heres what really sucks. i got laid off at the factory two days later because my boss's twin daughters were hospitalized for something. Last week my car exploded on the parkway while on my way to secure a new job at a dispatch company working on ambulances. Water pump exploded, lighting my alternator on fire.  AND NOW. My droid 2 was stolen from me at a party last saturday. NOT TO MENTION THE BRAND NEW ITOUCH I GOT FOR MY BIRTHDAY FELL OUT OF MY HANDS WHILE FUMBLING WITH MY KEYS THE NIGHT I GOT IT.  TL;DR broken itouch, got laid off, car broke, phone stolen, lost career opportunity could really use a pizza.
0	Long story short, due to rampant summertime flu circulating throughout the house, our paychecks were short last week, resulting in a momentary budget crisis. Electricity comes before food. We'll be fine on Friday, but we'd absolutely LOVE a pizza tonight. We'll definitely pay it forward. 
0	I'd love to celebrate via pizza lol (ky)
1	i recently lost my job and i havent been able to find work recently my car broke down and ive had to walk everywhere my money has run out a couple weeks ago and im out of food i havent eaten in a couple days and i really need some help. anything is appreciated god bless

Will update with happy pizza photos if donated! Will also love forever!   No address technically, but I can give an address and wait outside. It's that worth it to me.   Here's to pizza and awesome people!    Edit: To top off the sob story, I have two interviews next week on Tuesday, one at the same time the food bank opens =(    Edit2: I'll circle around the Internet area one more time tonight. Deliveries for probably 3 more hours. Tomorrow, the next day, or any day will be just as nice.   It will be about two weeks until I can buy my own deliciousnesses.

0	Hey guys, my summer campus job just ended and I'm going to be broke until my new one starts in a week. Pretty hungry and I won't be able to buy food on campus until the semester starts on the 31st. Save me from ramen! Haha
0	19-year old college student here, I have a grand total of 4 dollars in my bank account at the moment, and just ran out of all my food. Can somebody help me out here? I'm getting paid this week sometime and will definitely return the favor. Thanks in advance if anybody can save me here.
0	Not into sob stories, but I AM into honesty and NOT being hungryas we all should be). Im unemployed at the moment. My roomie/best friend is out of town and has been for a week. Ive sustained off the groceries we had but the fridge is going bare. I've got really good friends coming over tonight and I want to show them I care. Help me out? I can eat the ramen noodles.. I jus dont want that to be what I offer my friends... u kno? Its appreciated!! &lt;3&lt;3

0	hey raoh i was hoping someone could hook me up with a celebritory pizza for finding out today i got a job after 9 grueling months of being outta work. naturally i wont have any money til i get paid so a pizza  would be double as great! oh and u better believe it will be paid forward with first check!
1	Sup RAoP?  I'm chilling in my room, listening to some music and browsing Reddit. Suddenly I get hungry, and go to the campus pub for a meatball sub and some fries. Unfortunately, due to the lower quantity of students on campus this weekend (we have a four-day weekend this week and almost everyone has gone home,) the pub's hours are different, and when I got there they were already closed. Goddamnit.  Anyway, the first thing that popped into my mind, of course, was "REDDIT," and getting back to my room, the first thing I do is jump onto my computer and go right to RAoP. Now, I'm sitting here, pretty damn hungry, listening to Ensiferum and wondering what I can do to get some delicious pizza in my belly. So here's my offer. I am willing to provide a custom funny drawing of the giver's choice in exchange for a pizza. I'm not looking for anything extravagant as far as the pizza goes, and we have a cheap local place that delivers until midnight. In exchange for said pizza, you receive said drawing. The only other food I have right now is Martin's Salt and Vinegar potato chips, and while they are delicious, they simply aren't much of a meal. Please help this broke sophomore get himself some 'zza?  Help me Random Acts of Pizza, you're my only hope!  EDIT: ANARCHYREIGNS, YOU ROCK! Thanks for the pizza!  EDIT #2: Here's the picture, as promised: http://i.imgur.com/X7Koz.jpg

0	On sunday, my boss called me saying that he just received a letter from the city stating that he does not have the right building permits to do deliveries (public bathroom, tables, etc). So I got laid off. He offered my job but it was during the times when I'm in school so I couldn't take it.  Afterwards I was glad I had another 2 other jobs to fall back on at school. The next day I went and talked to both teachers about the jobs, both hired me for another semester. The I go to the work study off and it turns out that wasn't the case. I had lost my work study job due to my school's budget being cut.   At least school was paid off with some money leftover for me to live off of along with the money I saved up from working. I know it will be hard for me to find a job since I am in school full time. Some free pizza would at least put a smile on my face (and some of my unemployed friends' faces as well) after this, along with saving me some money.  If it helps, I have done the past 3 gift exchanges all with at least one rematch. Feel free to check that out. Maybe that will help my Karma for this one. http://redditgifts.com/profiles/view/Kaidenshiba/  location- St. Louis, MO, USA
0	Topperstix with pizza sauce from Toppers. I long for its taste.
0	I just want to say that hearing about this site today warms my heart.  I was laid off from my job and still trying to find a new one.  I'm only 3 months pregnant but not having any money that could be quite a scare. I'd like to say by the grace of God today there is food in the fridge thanks to food stamps.  But there were definitely times where a pizza would have lifted my spirits, and the fact that there are people here doing just that for others, you are all amazing.  If I had the funds right now to make an offer I would be doing so as well.  But let's just hope I don't need to make any requests anytime soon.  I just wanted to tell you all that you are great people.

0	Hi guys. My friend posted this is a link to our offer for a pizza in return for a free tshirt (pic in link). We are broke as hell and would love some kind stranger to buy a pizza for us. Even come party with us one night. Please reddit, show us some love.  http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPizza/comments/vuqnx/wroclaw_poland_4_irish_lads_working_for_a/
1	We are currently stressing out in our newsroom for various reasons to get content ready for the next day's paper. A pizza would make this all go down much easier and give our News editor moments of precious peace.
0	I just had the best night I've ever had in years. I've finally come out of my shell, opened up, and won over the most beautiful girl I've had the opportunity to have my arm around. I cannot express exactly how I'm feeling. I haven't stopped smiling, and my hearts still racing. I'm taking the chance to be close with someone again. And I figured I'd take the chance on a free pizza to enjoy while I feverishly tell my best friend what happened over Xbox live states away.   Oh, and if your a halo 4 fan.  RD DanDan
1	Well, the wife and I have been married a year tomorrow and we would LOVE to eat something other than Ramen on this special night but we are totally broke! God bless!
0	My friend forgot her wallet at home, and she has no way to get lunch. In general I think she has been having a bad day. I have no money until payday, but I don't want her to go hungry! I was hoping some kind soul would feed my friend!
1	Me and my housemate really want some pizza lovin'. But we're both low on funds, I lost my job last week, so she's been supporting me... I'm in Australia (Whittlesea area, VIC), 2 nearby pizza's places, the cheaper option is any Large pizza for 10 dollars... She will pose in any position (SFW) asked to the successful bidder with pizza and personalised love note... Other requests negotiable, no nudes etc  She does contracted modelling from time to time... I'm no photographer, but i'll try my best... Here's a sneak  http://i.imgur.com/1En8M.jpg http://i.imgur.com/DX0IE.jpg  And from today http://i.imgur.com/k73jw.jpg
1	I just recently moved out on my own and things are tough. I was laid off 2 weeks ago and now I am feeling the pain. I am going to be really behind on rent and I've had to cut costs. The biggest impact was groceries and gasoline. I can't afford to go anywhere. I haven't had meat and I am SUFFERING. I have been relying on rice and steamed vegetables for the past two weeks. Pizza would be a blessing right now.
0	My father just recently was a wealthy man with a high paying job at a bank, but because he took a loan from a client he got fired. My step-mom is jobless, filing for bankruptcy, and I work at McDonalds to have my own money. Unfortunately, I've been screwed over twice in the same day yesterday... My paycheck only clocked me for 8 hours where I deserved to be clocked 16, and the bank would absolutely not allow me to deposit or cash my check. So that leaves me without GTA V(which I had planned to buy yesterday), as well as without money in general. I had planned to buy a large pizza to share with my friends while we played GTA V but now none of that is possible. My friend brought his hard copy over to my house, and so now I request a random act of pizza be given to us. Note: This isn't a sob story, this is just a request so please don't feel guilty if you don't want to give us pizza. I have cereal.   TL;DR Wasn't able to get GTA V or pizza, so I'm asking for a random act of pizza. Much appreciated.
0	So, about a 2 months ago, I found a job. It took me three months of searching, and this one was part time and only paid about $650 a month- barely enough to get rent and food out of the way. The rest of my expenses have been coming out of my dwindling savings account for a while now.  I also got a stress fracture in my foot about a year ago. I was in and out of a walking boot for about 5 months altogether, and my doctor and I thought it was healed. I could walk 2-3 miles at a time and not encounter any pain and I thought I was in the clear.  And then I got this job, which required standing in one place for 8 hrs at a time. I did fine at the beginning, but then the pain started coming back. I guess my foot just couldn't take it. I got an ultrasound on it two days ago. Turns out the fracture has broken again, and I now also have arthritis in the surrounding area. I'm back in a walking boot. The one I have this time had to be a loaner from the doctor's office because insurance wouldn't pay for a new one. This one goes up to my knee and is a size too big, and it's hard to get around in it.  (I've also figured out that I can't really get worker's comp for it because it was a gradual injury, and in Virginia you're required to have a specific accident happen. It's also unlikely to happen because it happened previously not in the context of work.)   My boss got really snippy with me when I quit, and I just had to sit there crying for a while after I hung up the phone.  So, I'd love some pizza. I could make it last for a few days, and that'd be 3-4 meals that I wouldn't have to stand up to make. It'd be really helpful. As soon as I get a job where I'm not struggling to get rent, utilities, and food out of the way, I will definitely return the favor to someone else who needs it.  Sorry for the longwinded-ness, I'm just really not having a good time right now. :(  TL;DR: Broken foot causes me to lose shitty job that barely paid my expenses anyway. Would love pizza. Would also love to give pizza when I can afford it.
1	Hey everyone! When you're desperately trying to stay out of debt like I am bills often come before food and you find yourself with a roof over your head, but nothing in your stomach. I'm new here and am hoping to cash in some karma points to fill my belly. I will GLADLY post pictures of myself enjoying aforementioned delicious pizza. Help me internet! You're my only hope :) Thanks in advance
0	Hi we are a family of 6 and would love some pizza tonight . My husband has been out of work since october due to an auto accident , we get a check once a month towards lost wages but it doesn't go to far . We're hoping he can get back to work soon , but for now the roof over our head is more important than food in the fridge. we live in upstate NY , can provide proof . Thanks in advance.
0	So I'm desperate... I lost my job last week after my boss found out I was moving when the semester ends. Being an idiot, I didn't have very much money saved up. So now I'm really hungry, and have no food, or money. I'll pay it forward when I find work again.  Update: Chaosmosis came through and is just so many kinds of awesome!
1	Down to $.16 in a bank account and I have zero food in the house until payday eary next week. Haven't eaten all day and just got off a 11-hour shift. I'd really appreciate some pizza. This is a wonderful subreddit and I will be paying it forward as soon as my paycheck drops. Thank you kindly!
0	Hi, ROAP. I'm in a bit of a bind until Friday - I thought the money I was pulling from my savings/mutual fund for living expenses would be here by today but I just called USAA and they said it won't be available until Friday. I'm good on rent, utilities, and gas until then but I have two apples to my name and only have $38 (soon to be $13 after I go to the doctor's tomorrow). Living on a pizza and probably some more fruit that I pick up tomorrow won't be super healthy, but it'll get me to Friday =)  Verification code available, other pics available on request. Thank you vm in advance.  [Monies proof](http://imgur.com/OvbsY)
1	So, I [wrote](http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/lsqto/i_would_like_to_take_a_moment_to_rant_about/) a week or so ago about the problems I was having getting the student finance company to get my loan to me, and it still hasn't been resolved and I've reached the end of my overdraft (they'll only give me a £200 overdraft until my loan comes through). I tried to go to my university to get some emergency funds and the lady I spoke to said I could only get a £50 bridging loan which seeing as I'd have to pay back in 4 weeks she didn't want to give me. And after arguing with her for quite a while about how I needed the money to buy food she said that it didn't matter because the lady who could've given me the money left at 2pm (I went in at 1:30pm, she was just arguing with me for that long).   I then went into my bank to try and get my overdraft extended and they told me I needed to do it over the phone, went home and called them up and apparently I needed to go back to my branch and do it. And it would be shut by the time I went in again today....   So could anyone possibly send me a pizza or like... any other food? I haven't eaten all day :( 
0	So yeah... employer just told me to be packed up and out of here in two weeks this past Friday.  I'm backed up on my finances because of kidney stones that were so painful that I couldn't work a full 40 for a few weeks.  My job has no benefits and I couldn't afford to go to the doctor, so I manned up and gritted my teeth through it without awesome drugs...      Now my power, internet(which I'm downgrading soon) and TV service(i'm cutting the cord as soon as this stupid contract is gone), cell phone bills(on contract so nothing I can do here) are all late.  I've been late on my car payment twice in the past 5 months.  I can't afford to pay any of them right now because my rent is coming due, and if I don't pay that on time they charge a $50 late fee plus $10 for every additional day late.  I also need gas, and my car insurance is going to be due in full soon.  And I have a huge student loan in my mother's name with myself co-signed that I haven't been able to make the payment on for a few months... so I'm just hurting her.    I live alone and haven't really made many friends since I moved to this state.  I've been begging for part time jobs for over a year and no one is hiring me.  Now I'm close to being unemployed and my employer(staffing firm) hasn't found me a replacement yet.      I'm subsisting on Ramen, buttered pasta, the cheapest hot dogs I can find, and any other sale items I can find for less than $1 per dinner, around .50-.75 for lunch, and I don't even eat breakfast.      Before the troubles started I loved that new Dominos pan pizza.  I'm a cynical, pissed off, "hates everything" manic depressive who doesn't like to smile.  But that stuff always puts a smile on my face.         I'm going to join this sub, and as soon as I can I will return the gesture if someone can help me feel good again for a little bit before I start looking for stuff in my apartment to sell to pay these stupid bills.      If you live in the area I would be happy to try to help you with any technology issues that you may be having in return.
0	So I have never done this before, but i'm pretty desperate.  I am at school today with no money until tomorrow.  I have class in like 2 hours and i need to eat something.  I haven't had anything all day unfortunately.  there was nothing at my apartment to eat when I left for school either.  If there is anyone on here who can help, i will promise to return the favor to someone else in need.  thanks again for reading this, and hopefully helping me out. :)
0	Don't forget to request that the pizza place draw a unicorn on the box...
1	I don't have a sob story. I just have no money and would like to eat something other than ramen tonight. If someone could find it in their hearts to send some pizza love, I will send internet love back to you.
1	Hello fellow pizza enthusiasts, it's been a rough couple months. I've been subsisting on instant pancakes and rice for quite a while now since the opening for the store I'm supposed to work at keeps getting pushed back. Suffice to say I have never wanted a pizza more in my life. I've got 6 bucks left to my name and really just want a dang pizza
0	I'm 18 years old and I graduate this summer from high school. After a heated conversation with my parents I told them that I was an atheist. Being super religious, this did not go over well with them. Instead of loving their child unconditionally, they decided to kick me out of the house. (Thinking back on everything, I probably should have waited till I was in my college dorm later this year).   Anyway, I've been staying in an extra room at a friends house. They're gone for a week and I thought at least try here. A pizza can hold me over for a few days till I can get my small part time job pay check.
0	It would be super dope!! And I am sure my roommates would appreciate as well.
0	Elkin, NC
0	Seriously, I want pizza. It blows my mind that I can enjoy a free pizza from someone randomly on the internet. I am at work and would love to eat a pizza in front of everyone:-) Maybe I'll share, it's up to you!
0	I submit the following as a description of my situation, not a sob story.  I am out of work and freelancing, I wont get paid for another week at least. A pizza would be my first meal in 2 days, I have been sufficing myself on 25c bags of chips and water.   Well the chips are done, and I hope you can help.  I am the type who generally helps others, and will certainly pay this forward.  Thanks everyone.
0	Greetings, my generous redditors! I just got done with working three consecutive 12 hour shifts at Big Box retail store in IT for Tax Free Weekend.   I'm now in my first day off after the ordeal but 'lo by account is not large enough to bring forth to me a delicious pizza to melt away the sorrows of the weekend until Friday! If anyone would like to help in this ordeal please let me know!  Located in Tennessee.
0	So this is my roommate and my last night living together, we will both be going home which is about 3-4 hours apart. We've been friends since middle school and probably wont be able to hang out anymore (at least for a long time). We both recently left our jobs (I helped him get one on campus where I work). I worked their for 2 years and he worked there for a year. It would be nice to commemorate our final night of living together.
0	My 17yo son has 4 friends over (since last night), and the wife, trying to keep the costs of feeding this many noisy LAN gamers/Magic players under control, builds a monster meat loaf in our 11x17 Pyrex pan for our Sunday meal.  Cold meat, cold pan, cold oven - safe right?  She assembles the load, puts it into the oven at 325.  10 minutes later, we hear a muffled wet crack in the kitchen - and she finds that we now have a hot mega-mess in our oven.  No way to filter glass out - shattering pyrex could launch chips into the meat - and no way to use the oven until all the chips and fragments and gibs are collected off the bottom - ugh...  I'm starting to think these Pyrex pans shouldn't be trusted once they pass 8 years old!  http://www.flickr.com/photos/87675548@N02/9440810218/in/set-72157634936382098  Thanks in advance, Redditors!
0	Cafeteria's closed, can't deposit my first check from work until tomorrow (the ATM at the bank was out of envelopes!!!), got nothin in the way of snacks or frozen food. A hot pie would be extremely appreciated on a gloomy Sunday night like tonight. 
1	It's my Dalmatian's birthday. He's 13 years old, and loooooves pizza bones (crust). Would anyone like to make his birthday pizzariffic?  Edited to add:  Who can say no to this face?  http://i.imgur.com/Mepk60f.jpg
1	I just made my first down payment for college, I couldn't pass up a great deal on a laptop for classes, I have more down payments to make and a truck to fix in the coming weeks.   When the dust settles and my account isn't being sucked dry, I will gladly pay it forward :)
0	Long story short my work hasn't paid me for a fortnights worth of 12hour shifts (12 days on 2 off... It's been painful), I'm a little over $800 in the red freaking out about my car repayments, rent and everything else in between... I could really use a pizza to check off where the hell food for the day will come from, and come pay day (if it ever comes) will most definitely send on the pizza.  More than happy to verify anything, happy if nothing happens as at least I've finally used my reddit account.
0	I know, no one likes a sob story, but any offers would be appreciated by us. [Here's a picture of our dogs expressing gratitude.](http://i.imgur.com/YdimK.jpg) I followed all the instructions on the side bar so, I guess I'm verified.  I don't know if this helps but I haven't put on any clothes yet (been applying for jobs *online* all morning), and my wife says "do you think being nude asking for pizza will make you more successful?" what do you think reddit? will it? (i hope it doesn't do the opposite.)  Edit: I'm located in Southern California. I just saw the reminder to include location, i missed that.  Edit #2: Pizza has been received! thank you rorrim180! i was naked up until about 15 minutes before the pie arrived. i think it worked.
0	if you can i will really appreciate it. i have looked and saw that only Pizza Hut has a way to buy pizza with online payment. if you can buy me a Vegetarian Pizza i will be happy.   Thanks.
0	I have chronic pain due to osteoarthritis primarily in my left hip and all over my body because of my insurance being useless at letting my doctors actually do anything. This past week has been an extremely high pain week and I'm hoping a pizza will help with my really low morale and depression. Thanks for reading.
1	So pretty much your average run of the mill request. Me and my GF split up about a week ago, she is leaving and I am stuck with a lease I can't afford on my own, and have spent all my money paying for bills and gas to get to work. I don't get paid tell Friday and I have eaten through all the left over roman in the house. Could use a pizza to cheer me up and eat on for a few days. I'm not usually a requester and I am not horribly hard up, so if there is someone more deserving please choose them over me. Thanks for considering my request and happy pizza giving and what not. 
0	hungry couple in greater portland oregon area. no SSD $ til friday. nearest place is pizza hut. we will pay it forward when we're able. God bless! 
0	I just want to say, "thank you," in advanced to all you kind souls.  I'm at a breaking point today and I really, REALLY *despise* asking for handouts but I've had a couple nervous breakdowns since this AM.  **Here's my situation:** I'm beyond broke.  A couple of medical bills from the end of last year have put me WAY off my budget and I'm trying desperately to catch up. I'm behind on my mortgage, car and lights. On top of that I got stopped yesterday by the police while travelling from one job to the next and found out my license has been suspended from an old fine I forgot to pay.  So this morning I had to get my license straight, which costed $275 that I didn't have.  The best part was finding out on the way home this AM that my water got cut off.  That costed me another $180 that I didn't have.  I've never been so desperate in my life.  I need help, more help than a single pizza, I know, but one meal would mean the world for me right now.  I've got nothing in the cupboards to cook tonight and the money I was planning to buy dinner with is GONE.  I get paid tomorrow so a little kindness tonight would go such a long way.    I have three children and they are the real reason I'm asking for this tonight. I have a daughter, 9YOA, and twin boys, 2YOA.  One of my sons has a congenital heart defect and has been through three surgeries.  I'm a paramedic and I'm working as hard as I can to provide for my kids and allow my wife to finish school.    I can provide proof if needed through PMs.  Please, someone, find it in your heart to assist me this one time.  I don't ever ask anybody for anything, I'm usually the one helping others.
0	Alright, this isn't me, but my friend. He's a pre-law student trying to get into rapping. He's written about a dozen songs now about political issues/social issues/weed etc. and is about to go into a recording studio tomorrow to get his first demo recorded. He's completely baked right now and is aching for a pizza. Any redditor wanna wish him good luck tomorrow with a pizza and a drink?
0	EDIT: Location - Ypsilanti, MI  I get paid biweekly and the beginning of the month drained my accounts (rent etc.) Though I don't want this to become some sappy story. I'm just really hungry and would love if anyone from reddit could help.  I can assure you I'll buy someone a pizza once my next paycheck comes in.
0	Hello fellow Redittors,  I'm a long time reddit lurker (started last summer with the keanu meme) with one favor to ask one kind redittor.  Last night I found out that the pasta box in the counter was empty so I ate my last sandwich and I don't have anything for tonight's dinner.  I would be extremely grateful if one of you generous redittors offered to help me with dinner tonight.  Any type of help is appreciated.
0	We've been getting food from the local pantry (a little less than 1 bag of groceries a week) and aren't starving, but having to serve  pasta again is taking an emotional toll.   Thanks for considering us... Lee
1	(Forgot to mention that I live in Central TX)   Long shot, but here goes.  I'm unemployed and going through a divorce. Aside from cheating on me she spent all my money and what little I had left went straight to the divorce. I'm down to my last $35.00-----period. This is AFTER selling everything I have that I don't still owe money on. I literally own nothing else but clothes, computer, car, and a dryer. My friends and family have already helped far too much and I'd hate to ask for more favors. I'm ALL out of groceries and won't begin to collect unemployment for another week or two. I didn't eat at all yesterday.   I was wondering if there was someone out there who would be kind enough to feed me today. I don't care what size or whats on it, I just need something to eat. 
0	Ive been eating nothing but rice and when im lucky ramen for almost 4 months now since being laid off from my computer repair gig. I live in Alaska where the economy and culture is about 4-5 years delayed from the rest of the US so the recession is only now starting to really take hold here, as such Ive been unable to find any regular work even at any of the typical franchised fast food joints. BUT I can make music, so if there is any kind of song you have ever wanted to hear or have made for yourself, a loved one, a personal project, or perhaps a video or web-series of yours; tell me about it and I will make it happen for a pizza. Preferably a pizza with meat on it, I literally have dreams of meat and cheese these days.   I can do electronic, hip-hop, blues, rock, doom metal, black metal, world/ethnic, orchestral pieces, 80s synth pop, ambient, almost anything really. If desired, I could sing a name, tagline, or slogan and do it jingle style or even use crazy robot voice effects. I could also mimic a specific artists style. [Here are some examples of my production.](https://soundcloud.com/metacitizen)  TLDR: Will music for food
1	This hurts my pride to beg like this, but the position I am in leaves me with few options and hungry. I have my daughter with me and I'm flat broke with not much food in the house besides a couple cans of black beans and peanut butter; nothing I'd constitute as a meal. To anyone that is feeling generous enough to send a pizza my way it would be appreciated beyond words. I thought this would be worth a shot. 
0	Hello!  I'm down on my luck, and would love more than anything to have a pizza tonight so I can watch the Obama/Romney debate with some food in me! (Cause you know I will need it.)  Thanks :)
0	So here I am, stuck at home on vacation. I have no money because student loans suck. All I have until Friday is ramen, eggs, and a pickle.    I am hoping someone out there in internet-land will be kind and give me a hand. Thank you in advance  Edit: Forgot to mention I live In RI. And only have access to a Dominoes or a Papa Gino's.
1	We ran out of food and have none left, no money until monday, we must eat something!  We can offer a pic of us doing almost anything [sfw only].  And as a bonus, [here is a picture of me not being able to feed my horse or myself.](http://i.imgur.com/kpmTz.jpg)  *edit* Forgot to mention that our location is Flagstaff, AZ   *edit 2* SmoochyTheRhino gave us a pizza!      
1	I'm currently in the process of moving out today and I am literally dead broke, my parents are refusing to put any of my money into my bank account so I'd face overdrafting charges. Could someone possibly spare a pizza for me? :)
0	I can't believe I never found Reddit before today, I've been wasting my life on 4chan -_- Things are a lot more awesome here.  So I heard you can request pizza here, well I just bought $200 worth of groceries yesterday so I'm good. I wanna repay a favor to a friend I've known for a very short time, but he's done a lot for me in that time.  I lost my job a while back and started posting up my stuff for sale online. He's been a godsend to me, he's bought stuff from me on multiple occasions and helped me eat when I wouldn't have been able to otherwise. He lives an hour away and he travels down here to buy from me and even takes me to the grocery store so I don't have to waste money on a cab! I've known the guy less than 2 months and he's already been more awesome than anyone else has been to me in probably my whole life.  He's been sweating some bills due this week, but even though he was strapped he helped me out big time earlier this week. I had to notarize my I-9 for my new job and get my driver's license renewed. He spent 5 hours on Tuesday not only taking me to the DMV and the notary, but he did it with money out of his own pocket. I tried to pay him back yesterday but he wouldn't let me, he said he did it out of friendship. The mans struggling to pay his bills this week and he helped make sure I could get back on my feet at long last, now that's a friend.  He's got 2 kids under the age of 7 he's in his late fifties no less, so the man is definitely a warrior in my mind. I won't start getting paid for a few more weeks, but he's had it rough the past few days and still put me before himself. I wanna thank him but I had to buy three weeks worth of food yesterday in one sitting, plus pay for the cab ride, so I'm  fresh out of dough. It never even crossed my mind to send him a pizza until I wandered on here. He can't very well turn down dinner when it arrives at his door free of charge, so that's what I wanna do.  Anyone think they can spot me a gift card so I can send him some dinner tonight or tomorrow? He's been awesome to me these past few months, he even overpaid me for some of the things he bought because he knew I needed the money. This would be a small drop in the bucket but I wanna pay him back for some of his kindness at least. I don't mind coming back in three weeks and returning the favor, I'm gonna be set making 14 an hour at this job, but he could use this right now, I know he could. So pretty please, will someone help me make this man's day?  I don't have many friends, and finding a best friend at such a low point really saved my life. I can't ever repay him for all of it, just some of it, and this is how I wanna start.
0	Been looking for work for 2 weeks since moving back to my hometown.. Haven't had a paycheque for 2 months. Finally get a lead, two phone interviews, and an interview scheduled for today. I get in there, and the HR manager explains that they "Tried to reach me yesterday" to tell me not to come in. Unfortunately they did not email nor did I have a message on my phone from them, so I just wasted the entire last 24 hours scrambling around and spent the rest of my money getting prepped for an interview I showed up for and didn't even fucking get.  Pizza may in fact be the only thing that satisfies my vindictive rage at this point. Moreso I'm just really, really hungry and haven't been able to eat well lately. The friends I'm staying with give me a bite here and there, but they're very low income with 3 kids and I try to avoid it at all costs. Would seriously appreciate it, and pay it forward!
1	Hey guys, this week was the week my rent was due and because of that, I have about 20 dollars to last me for food/public transit to work every day this week until I get paid on Friday. A simple pizza would be appreciated, and in the future, I can try and get you a better pizza in return. Thank you, and I appreciate the help, if I get it.
0	Hiya, I apologize for not really being a part of the reddit community, but I browse from time to time. Please don't hold it against me. Anyways, here's the deal. It's Saturday, I have a little over $5 in my bank account, nothing but roommate chow at the apartment, a flat tire on my bike, and it's so windy and dusty out that the sky is pretty brown right now.   By trade, I am a freelance writer. Sometimes it pays fabulously, the last few months not so much. But I understand the give-and-take of economy and I'd much rather put something together for you than accept charity. So I'm thinking a page of whatever you want for a medium pizza. Haiku about Thundercats, a love poem for your girlfriend to smooth over the fact that you got really drunk last night, I can get you started on that paper you're putting off, or just the word butt as many times as I can fit on the page. And none of that copy-paste bull crap either, I promise to type each one of those butts individually and by hand.  Maybe you want more than one page. These things happen. And I happen to be able to put away far more pizza than is probably healthy for me. Or I might want mushrooms AND pepperoni. We can work it out.  Just about the only thing I won't write is a signed confession that I was the one who committed that murder the cops are getting closer to solving. Let them figure it out on their own.  If you order a pizza for me, I promise to not only write for you, but will also enjoy said pizza ravenously while playing the video game of your choice, assuming I have it in my collection (odds estimated at 1 in 15). Can provide photo proof of brown sky, flat tire on bike, or other reasonable requests if needed. Will gladly provide gratuitous photo proof of pizza enjoyment if desired.  Thanks RAoP!
1	Will draw a little torso sketch of you as a fantasy thing or your zodiac sign for pizza :-) Something along the lines of one of these (some I have done of/for friends):   http://imgur.com/a/S6lrO
0	Copy pasting my post I made in /r/RandomActsOfPizza before I realized there was this sub. Figure I'll have a better shot here based on subscriber totals.   &gt;Just used everything I have to pay off my overdue rent, as well as this months, and I'm left with nothing for groceries and like four uncooked burger patties and a small Tupperware container of rice left.  &gt;I'm waiting on a friend who is out of town to come back to give me money he owes me so I can go grocery shopping, but... I've no idea when that'll be. I could really use some pizza when said burgers and rice runs out to help stave off hunger for a while. It'd be very, very much appreciated.
0	I feel like shit to even have to ask. i've been out of a job for a while (too long) and we live off of a single disability cheque for 2 ppl (940 a month or so) most of the time we can make it work, this month due to some unforeseen expenses we're about a week short, We're not gonna starve because we've basically rationed what we have, but we couple prob stretch a single pizza into a couple days of meals. Figured worst case this post gets ignored so may as well try, thanks to all you wonderful people either way!
0	I'd love to get a pizza for my dad, it'd have been my moms birthday tomorrow and hes taking it pretty rough.. he's visiting me tonight and I can't afford to get one myself right now, buy will pay it forwards asap, promise ! (toronto, ontario, canada)
0	Haven't ate anything but a bowl of cereal for breakfast at 7am this morning before class, and now my laptop is making a very loud screeching sound - probably the fan. Some random pizza would be greatly appreciated to fill an empty stomach.
0	I got a new job that started earlier this month, and they only pay monthly. So its either eat or not go to work for two days on the job i just started
1	Been having a very rough time with a few surprise expenses and I have incoming income but it won't be here for about a week. I'm not exactly at "ramen is all I have" status but potatoes, beans, rice, and cream o' wheat will only go so far and a pizza will hold me over for darn near 3 days before I actually finish it. Would anyone care to show me some pizza love?  Fair warning: I may decide to try to talk you out of it if you try to help... don't let me. It's something between pride and optimism... :)  **EDIT**: Request fulfilled. Thanks to dihydrogen_monoxide
0	My roommate and I have been studying for finals for awhile now and we realized that we are completely out of food and would love a pizza if you would be willing to send one our way. :)
0	I would enjoy if someone would order me a just a totally plain cheese pizza from papa johns. Uhm I'm just really hungry and don't get paid till tomorrow so I would like to eat today haha. I don't know what else to say this is my first time you know. Oh yeah you might want to know that I'm from Texas. You can just order online. :)
0	So I have 23 papa points on my papajohns.com account. If someone who plans to give a pizza today would be so kind as to spend $10 on my papa john's online account, I could get a free pizza care of papajohns.com. It's like a 2for1 gift!
0	I just got diagnosed with throbbing gristle disease. If you don't know what that is then you're defenatly better off.  Could really use a pizza tonight to take the depression away.  Philadelphia
0	We are sitting in the bottom of the library, hungry and none of us want to leave to get food because we might miss part of what we are studying. 300 question with short answer and essay questions suck. Located in Metro-Detroit area.
0	Would love some pizza and to pay it forward soon, my random kind pizza loving compatriots 
1	Just had to shell out most of my paycheck on 2 new tires for my car, and now I am very low on $ till I get paid on Friday. I have plenty of baby food for my son for the week, but I am 7 months pregnant and hungry :) If anyone could help out, I would really appreciate it! I can provide verification. Thanks!   Edit: Im in Northern VA
1	I'm in Kent, Ohio. I haven't had a meal in two days for financial reasons. I don't get off work until 5 so the bank will be closed. I'd appreciate a pizza. I will pay it forward.
0	I'm going into a residential rehab tomorrow for 6 months. It's finally time to get my life together once and for all. A pizza from a random redditor would be a great going away gesture. Thanks.
0	PizzaReceived see you in a few weeks RAoP And thank you so much ;)
0	Hoping for some pizza. No sob story, just feeling hungry, thanks :)
0	If you want to read more, this is the loan request in r/assistance: http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/13pexq/identity_got_stolen_share_and_share_draft/  I'm already going to assume that no one will give me a loan and I'm going to have to ride it out until next week. I could really use a pizza or something that has a high calorie and triglyceride content so Ican eat a slice before work and power through my shift loading trailers. All I have right now is a cup of parboiled rice and without cash and not knowing any of the cooks at local resturants, I need some help. 
1	My stomach is hurting and there is nothing in my fridge to eat unfortunately :-/ I will provide pics of said fridge lol. I would be forever grateful if someone could help out, and I would pay it forward in the future when i'm in a better situation.
0	Where's my pizza?
0	My husband &amp; I have been living with family until our new place was ready for us to move in. After NIPSCO, water, moving trucks, storage bill, we are completely tapped out. We sent our two year old to my dad's since we didn't have much in the way of food. I don't get know when the food pantry is open around here, or else I would be there! Not too proud for that. We were just laying around, listing what food would hit the spot!
1	I just want to start off by saying how wonderful this community is. I've been looking at some of these posts on here, and how helpful and giving those within the community have been, and it really warms my heart to know there are people like that out there in the world.  I'm wondering if there a chance someone would be willing to help me out as well. I'm a stay at home mom, raising my three little ones, Jason (6) and Michelle and Christina (both 3 1/2), while my husband works. Sadly, he lost his job about a year ago, and with this economy, he has only been able to pick up jobs here and there, and we're getting towards the end of our savings.  I would love to be able to sit down with a nice pizza dinner one night, and just be able to relax and enjoy the company of one another, that is, before the little ones start crying again. Pizza used to be a luxury purchase for us before, now it is almost impossible.  Anyone with a soft spot in their heart able to help out?  Thanks 
0	I thought I had enough to get some more ramen, but it turns out that I used my remaining quarters to do laundry. I do get paid Friday, but until then I'll be at the mercy of my hunger pangs. A little pizza would go a long way. Reddit, help a brother out!
0	So you can read my iama about the whole orphan thing. Basically i have nothing left, and its my last night staying at my friends house in turlock before i go back to palo alto, all ive been eating here is ramen, and i was hoping maybe reddit would be able to help me have one last good dinner, before i have to live in a shelter:). 
0	Not a dire situation, really, but there are certain times when a pie would hit the spot. This is one of those times. Thanks.
0	started a new job that's an hour+ away from me (after being unemployed for nearly 4 months). two weeks before my first check. about $6 in my bank account and everything else goes to gas and moving expenses so i don't have to drive so far for this job. maxing out credit card just paying for gas and rental deposit. bah.  i'm tired and hungry and just want a giant pizza and some soda.
0	My husband is an ice cream man making 25% commission. I'm currently jobless waiting to hear back from a temp service. My husband works his ass off for free pretty much, because he cannot find a job not even through the three temp services in our area. When he first started this job he was making amazing money. But things slowed down extremely. He went from bringing home $100-$200 a night to $15 or less a day. He also has to pay for gas which is $15 a day. So as you can see he's not making money at all right now.     The only reason why he is staying with this job, is because the owner is making him co-owner next year and also letting him stock vending machines so he'll be making two salaries. So my husband is trying to keep whats best for our future in mind.    However I'm in starvation mode, I've lost 4 pounds in one week due to not eating. I've been snacking around the pieces of moldy bread, hoping for my husband to have a good day and hoping I hear back from the temp service that is suppose to be contacting me back.. I just called my husband and he's only at $60 (he makes 25% of that, which will be used for gas ) and he's going to be heading back to the shop in 20 minutes. So it's another bad day. My stomach is killing me. It would mean everything if someone could help out.      I'm posting from an alternative account because I communicate with far away friends and I don't really want people to know how much we're failing right now. I wont hesitate to give proof, My username, pictures of my cabinets and refrigerator, Facebook name, etc. I'm just extremely hungry, it feels like everything is just crashing down and it sucks.
1	Hey, I don't have a lot of food around the house at the moment, and I probably won't be getting a paycheck for a few weeks at least, so I'm asking if one of you kind redditors would like to buy this bloke a pizza.  Many thanks in advance.
0	I am by no means starving, but i'm currently visiting my g/f in Berkeley (im from denver), and before i left, i lost my wallet (credit cards, debit cards, ID's, etc. luckily had my passport to get on the plane). But I ran outta cash and have no means of getting pizza (which happens to be my favorite food), and itd b real nice to get some pizza and not have to bum off her for one night. I will absolutely pay it forward when i get home and get sorted. If your are only able to give once though, plz help out someone more in need, im just a poor college student, but i only gotta take care of my self. Promise to take pics.  Be easy.
0	We haven't had food fo the weekend because of our school's awkward food service schedule. We're trying to celebrate the Earth Hour tonight at 8:30 - 9:30pm central time. Just trying to eat beforehand.
1	I will help someone anyone even it doesn't work.   Being hungry is the shittiest feeling of all time.  Update:  Mission Accomplished thanx to Sectorfour  http://i.imgur.com/a1AYp.jpg
0	hey im a 42 year old man and i never really ask for much and i never really try to. i grew up that way but lately times have just been well a little too stressful and i am really just not wanting to come off as a bad guy or a sad excuse for a man but my two boys they have been acting as if they dont like me as much i dont kno maybe its just cause they are teens but i just want to spend a little family time with them but i really cant spare any funds. i work everyday and still barely can keep a roof over our head but i try my damndest and i do alright. but i just need some family time with my wife and two boys. i just miss it is all. if you could help me out id really appretiate it. thank you all god bless
0	I do freelance work online, but it isn't nearly enough to cover the bills. I rely on a local food bank (diabetes makes this difficult), and the assistance of my family. I'm looking for reliable work, but I live in a small town and I don't own a car; it makes things somewhat difficult. I've lived off of water and rice mixes for the last eight days, and could really go for a small pepperoni pizza. Nothing fancy; I'm a die-hard pepperoni fan.  Please message me, if you're feeling generous. There's a Papa Johns and a Pizza Hut within delivery distance, and a couple of Mom &amp; Pop places within a short walking distance.
0	I just ran 7+ miles and would love a pizza, I have 0 dollars and am pretty hungry! (Everything I have takes hours to cook). Any size is fine! PM me for my address. Thank you in advance!
0	I havent had comercial pizza in a while and yes im just a guy in a blue chair in metro east St Louis if you proffer to my request ill send you a picture of my chair and you will know I truly am just a guy in a blue chair.

1	I'm starting a new job Sunday, don't have any money, and my internet and cellphone will probably be cut off within a week.  I'm going to school so I'll be getting my loan money within the month, but for now I'm cranky and hungry.  I'm an author, so I'll be willing to either pay you back by buying a pizza when my money comes in or including you as a cameo in my next book...  or even writing a short story based around any subject you'd like.  For an example of my writing: [My first published book!](http://www.amazon.com/Spliced-Bloodsoak-Chronicles-ebook/dp/B00795J83O/ref=sr_1_17?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359074784&amp;sr=8-17&amp;keywords=Spliced!)
0	I lost my job two and a half weeks ago and have been constantly on the hunt for a new job since then.  I've been living off of family leftovers, PB&amp;J and cereal since then.  I'd love nothing more than something nice and hot for dinner tonight (and the next few nights cause holla, leftovers!) and Papa John's has their buffalo chicken pizza on special today.  As soon as I am able, I would be more than happy to pay it forward if someone were so inclined to help me out.  Thanks!
0	Or it could be an attempt at induction into the order of pizza I guess. 
0	Just throwing this out there. Will pay it forward when possible. 
0	Yay college.   Also, I get payed this weekend so if you are kind enough to help us out, I will pass it forward to another Redditor of YOUR choice. 
1	Hey gents and ladies,  I am a very poor college student that has to work to pay for school, rent, and food because the rents refuse to help. Because I came down with the flu for a week and a half, I couldn't go in to work (its policy) and thus only have money for rent. I've been subsisting just about entirely on PB&amp;J sammiches. I just finished biking home from work, and would really appreciate a nice warm pizza tonight.   Ps-I am using a throwaway because my main is linked to several close friends that are also redditors, and I don't want them to know of my financial situation.  You guys are fantastic, and if anyone does respond, please know that you will make a poor UF girl really happy! &lt;3 :D  **Edit: it appears my title lost my location. I'm in Florida. :)
0	and I'm all out of bubblegum.
1	We all woke up this morning feeling absolutely horrible. The two kids especially the youngest just want to cuddle with me all day. My a/c is having trouble keeping the house cool below 80 and it would make it worse for me to use the oven to cook since they're running fevers. I'm having financial trouble at the time but I hope one day I can repay someone with a pizza too! Thanks!
0	So finally moved out and after paying first and last I'm kind of short on cash. Last of my money went on groceries which didn't last too long. Waiting on my next pay check (Friday).   Unfortunately didn't have much for saving because I went to summer school to get some extra credits.  I am willing to repay the favor Friday and provide my non throw away account :]. Normally I'd use my actual account but I don't want to let me friends or family know that I'm in a bit of a financial situation until my next pay check.   Thank you in advance :]
0	Background: Health insurance got cancelled because left old job, new job didn't start for a while, started in that magical time frame that allowed me to go way too long without a paycheck and COBRA wants 900 dollars so she can get her shots to continue to finish her education.   So, I'd really LOVE for her to fill up on a yummy pizza.  If this works, I love the internet. If it doesn't, I still love the internet!  We're just north of Philadelphia, PA  
0	I made the genius decision to avoid my drunk ex-boyfriend who usually is so wasted by 7pm on Fridays that he starts harassing me at the bar with "I know I just dumped you but maybe it was the worst decision I've ever made" by staying in tonight. I've also made the genius decision not to drink which would inevitably cause me to pathetically text him until he pays attention to me. I'm craving extra cheese pizza like whoa. If someone feels generous, help a bitter lady stay in and watch Star Trek. It would restore my faith in the fact that a lonely reddit life is absolutely better than the real world. EDIT...SO many likes...no pizza. :(
1	The title pretty much sums it up. I am stuck at work for a 15 hour shift and wasn't able to eat breakfast. I can't afford to get anything for myself due to recent bills. Any help would be greatly appreciated! I have a Domino's near me; I think that's everything I needed, thanks for reading.
1	Sorry, this is a throwaway, can provide my real UN if someone wants to help out.   It would be really awesome if someone could order my husband and I a pizza. We have no children or anything like that. Just broke until tomorrow. We usually plan our money well, but our car broke down 2 times in the past 3 days. First our fuel pump went out, we got that fixed now the battery went out (possibly the alternator which I hope not) . We just bought this car so it cut us short all around.. We don't have enough money to even get the /battery/ fixed until tomorrow as well. Anyways that's the reason why we are broke at the moment. We usually keep our refrigerator full but that didn't happen this week.   Also..some kind redditor helped us out awhile ago with pizza. I have 10$ in my amazon account I can order something for you in return.. We're just really hungry..  Sorry if this is kinda all over the place I have not slept in almost two days.   If you need any proof just ask, nothing to hide here.   
0	Hello my name is michael and my roomate is johnathon. We are hungry because are foster home doesnt get a food delivery untill monday and all we have to eat is shitty dry cereal and old freezer burned meat. I would love to have a pizza or two. I live in a foster home with 5 other boys. I live in SOS childrens village in coconut creek florida. If you need the adress let me know.
0	As the title suggests, I've got nothing in my home until tomorrow. My parents are out (small holiday like thing) and unfortunately my brother devoured all of the food in my house. This is a quick throwaway to avoid my friends whom all seem to stalk my history on Reddit. I'll be more than willing to provide my actual Reddit account in PM.   Appreciate you taking the time to read this
0	I just paid my rent and have no money left. I am a full time student and I work. I'm fresh out of food and don't get paid until Monday... This would make my night.
0	I'm going to keep this as short, but still have it make sense, as possible. I intended on moving to Pennsylvania from Nevada into my grandfathers house, was stated before I left that I'd already have a job at a local grocery store, and that everything was set for me to get there.  So I drive 2700 miles cross country in a car that shouldn't have made it, I spend practically all of my money in doing this. I get there and everything is fine for about a day. He decides that I cannot stay at the house when he's gone (I am almost 22), so two or three days after I get there, he has a funeral he has to be at, and me not comfortable going to a funeral of someone I didn't know, don't go. I drive around and drive by a little later and no ones there, so i get out of my car and say fuck it and lay in the front yard, get bored and leave again, 30 minutes later he's back and everythings fine.  The next morning he wakes me up at 10 asking me if I'm going to sleep all day, proceeds trying to get into an argument with me saying i tried to break into his house the day before while he's gone, accusing me of unlocking all his windows and says he knows I tried to break in because he has someone following me around taking pictures. Screaming at me that I'm a liar when I did nothing wrong, and he wants me to leave. So I gather all my shit up and call my uncle. He says I can stay in a run down trailer behind his friends house.   I'm 2700 miles away from anything or anyone I know staying in a run down trailer, with no money because I spent $300 driving across country, no job because I was lied to, and looking at selling my car to get back home. My uncles broke and can't help me, the people I'm staying at frequently eat out. I have no cash, my cars out of gas, and it basically feels like no one gives a shit. I came trusting my grandfather was trying to help me, and all he did was displace me, break me, lie to me, and insult me.   I'd just like something to get me through until I get the documents so I can scrap my car to a salvage company ( that I paid 1K for before I left) so I can get a bus ticket back to Nevada. Which should be monday or tuesday depending on how fast my mom gets to the DMV. And before you ask my mom is unemployed and unable to help. I don't like asking people for help but I love helping others. This will definitely be paid forward as soon as I can. I'm in the eastern PA area.  Thanks for any help any one can give, it won't be forgotten and will definitely be paid forward.  TL;DR Moved out to PA from NV, was told I had a job, didn't, grandfather went all schizo on me, now I'm staying in a run down trailer behind my uncles friends house, waiting for the paper work for my car so I can scrap it and go back home.  http://imgur.com/Hah9o
0	Made this account because I'm one of them lurker folk :P I broke my arm and didn't have insurance (couldn't afford) so now I'm in a bad boat :( Anything will be appreciated, even a gift card for like 5$ or something!
0	I've noticed that the acceptable custom in RAOP appears to be to post your desire for pizza along with a compelling story of trial and hardship which validates your worthiness to receive said gift.  I don't have such grand aspirations.  My desires are pure, transparent, and fly in the face of this custom.  I want a pizza.  I want someone else to pay for it.  In some cosmic way, doe this warrant an x-post in r/firstworldanarchists?
0	Good day kind folk of /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza;  As stated in the title, my class is holding a debate on the true nature of man, good or evil- myself and half of the class on the 'good' side, the other half on the 'evil' side. While myself and my peers discussed various properties of our assigned moral alignment, the concept of charity came up in discussion- and some of us being redditors, we immediately thought of this subreddit.  It would be greatly appreciated if someone could send us a pizza of any size and type (preferably something generic) around 8:35AM PST, October 13th, and hopefully inspire our pessimistic peers to see past the idiocy and greed omnipresent in our media and wall street and realize that there is such thing as pure human charity. **We remain committed to returning the favour to the subreddit as well, to an equal or greater value than the sent pizza :).**  Note: We do not intend on using any sent pizza as a bribe, if there is enough to share with our small class of 15 people (it's an alternative high school) we will. We believe we have a solid argument and the pizza will be delicious evidence :).  Thank you /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza for your time!

0	I don't know what else to say. Iv been cooking for myself for awhile now (crappy soup, sometimes Hamburger Helper, and lots of rice) and would really like something that tastes good. I can provide proof of..me I guess or whatever. Thanks for considering.   **Edit:** Oh and the pipes to my shower or something are leaking...
0	I'm pretty broke and have nothing to eat. Nor the ability cook something without giving my self food poisoning, so please give me some pizza! In return i can write a poem about anything you want, i'm no Carol Anne Duffy but i'll write it to the best of my ability. Please someone respond. I will be completely willing to return the favour as soon as i get some money. Thanks for taking a look.  Also i'm very sad, but a pizza would make me happy!
1	i've been out of work do to a broken wrist for the last couple months. money is really tight, as i don't qualify for shortterm disability. my live-in girlfriend is super supportive, but we are both really stressed out due to finances.   we haven't eaten out in months, and her favorite food is pizza. she has had to do most of the cooking and cleaning since my injury (hard as hell to scrub pots with one hand). i have spent all day cleaning the house, but to really make her evening, i'd like for her to have pizza.  **EDIT: bombtechdave rules.
1	Now, I'm not poor, per se. Yes, there's currently $5 in my bank account total, but I'm not wanting for food. I stocked up at the store and I have enough to eat.  That being said, I'm sick of it. Everything I have is based on sandwiches. Ham on wheat. Eggs on wheat. Peanut butter and jelly... on wheat.  I've got enough food and I don't have a particularly rough life, so I'd hate to argue for the front of the queue of this font of generosity, but...  ... if anyone wants to help me have a hot delicious meal as opposed to an acceptable room temperature meal... it'd lift my spirits.  Thank you very much for your consideration.
1	Okay so to keep things short, my fiancee has been having a really rough week and I'd like to surprise her with some pizza. The only problem is due to some recent financial obligations and trouble, I am low on funds and unable to buy it for her. So if anyone has any good coupons or deals, or would be willing to gift her some pizza I'd be really gratefully and will definitely gift it forward as soon as I can. She has Papa Johns and Dominos nearby, and we are located in Lynchburg, Virginia.  Thanks!!
0	I saw Random Acts Of Pizza on ABC news, and I have been lurking all day reading about all of the wonderful things this reddit has done. I just signed up today to be apart of this, and sad to say the first thing i will be doing is requesting. I haven't ate anything but a bagel in the last 3 days, and my paycheck comes in on friday, I am so hungry so if anyone would please help me out i will be sure to buy a pizza for someone in need when my check comes in  thank you reddit for listening
1	I'm a graduate filmmaking student at Montana State University in an MFA program. I'm currently working as an equipment technician on a series being produced for Discovery Channel. However, the company I actually work for is based out of the UK and getting my first paycheck has been quite a long time coming, as paperwork and such takes awhile to go back and forth. I'm currently down to $2.00 in my bank account.  I am expecting to get my first paycheck next week and will gladly re-visit this board to pay the pizza forward and buy one for someone else who needs it.   Thanks for listening. :)  EDIT: ReillyBoy helped me enjoy a delicious pizza from Dominoes and went even further. She has reminded me that generosity is alive and well in a time when selfishness seems to have run amok. 
0	I'm not getting any money until tmrw, I haven't eaten in a couple of days and then I had like ramen it obliterated my digestive tract. I would love some pizza
0	Very broke college student who's out of meals for the semester (living off pudding snack packs is awful!) I've been doing work for finals all weekend and would really, realllyyy appreciate some brain food :]]
0	Really need some cheering up and nothing would do that like a pizza pie. 
0	my necessary things like internet and good food are all gone all i have in the fridge is a single yogurt and some sauces, would help alot if anyone can grace me with a pizza.  I'm from Bath UK
0	Long story short, its a school holiday and all I have is ramen and water. Anything would be greatly appreciated. 
0	me and my mother have been having issues the last couple months, and normally I hate asking people for assistance, but we have no food, no refridgerator, and just barely a roof over our head, I haven't eaten in about 2 days. investing faith in humanity :)
0	I'm in summer school and I spent all my money on books and Webassign. ($200 just to access my homework...)  I have a minimum wage job that pays on a week delay and I won't see a nickel until June 11. [Here is all the food I have left.](http://imgur.com/7qK3D7o)  I would be sooooooo happy to have some pizza this evening.  Raleigh, NC  Edit: Do one of you know me? I just got an email for a free pizza from Papa Johns...
0	Title pretty much says it all. No sob story or anything, just willing to do a random act to get some pizza
1	Hello fellow redditors,  I lost my job earlier this month, and my pockets are near empty. I'm fortunate to have landed a decent job, but my stomach is grumbling and I'm almost out of bread. It isn't a completely desperate situation, but if anyone is willing to help me out I couldn't thank them enough. I could send you a small painting or sculpture when I'm able to cover shipping and all that, if that interests you.  Thanks for reading
0	Nothing more to really say, I have been clearing trees and brush for 6 hours and could really go for a pizza.
0	Location: Chicago  I'm a bit under the weather, and after having worked an 8 hour shift starting at 4:30am yesterday, my sleep schedule is a tad fucked. So I'm wide awake at one in the morning.   And I would adore a delivery of any hot food right about now. There's only so much canned split pea soup that one person can consume.  Love and luck to all my fellow service industry workers on St. Paddy's day weekend!
0	Me and my girlfriend have run out of food and the only money we have left is for our train tickets home tomorrow. We'll return a pizza back to community when we have christmas money!  http://i.imgur.com/1JUds.jpg
0	A series of unexpected expenses and some irresponsible account balancing has left me quite hungry.  It's days like this I wish I was a server!  Would be in serious debt to anyone willing to help out.
1	Thanks for taking the time to read this. I've been craving my favortie pizza (chicken and jalapeno with white sauce) for a while, but money just seems to go to bills or paying my mother back for money she lends me if things get too tight. Again thanks for even considering.
1	I guess I could just eat the cereal, but that's all I've eaten for days. It's pretty nauseating. I've actually been really down lately because I literally haven't hung out with people in ages. That aside, I don't have a job anymore, and my food supply has gone low. If someone could just buy a pizza for me today, I would honestly appreciate it and spread it out as long as possible. Hopefully things will pick up around late July/August as everyone goes back to school
0	I am on my 3rd day of the flu. I have no money or groceries.
0	Hi everyone. I want to first start off by saying this is a great subreddit and you guys help out a lot of people. This is my first time ever asking for something like this but here it goes.   I live with my sister and her bf in the so cal area. Lately they've been getting into a fights over financial issues. They have a 1 year old daughter that I watch for them everyday, and another baby on the way. I think a random act of pizza would really lift everyone's spirits.   Well, yeah. Thank you all for reading and take care. 
0	Walked around town about 4 times, did some squats and pushups. No money until next week for groceries. We have food but only bread and whatnot. A Pizza or 2 would make me and my family too happy! :D  zacknormandin@gmail.com
1	I'm really high right now and love some pizza.  Morning after edit because I couldn't edit on my phone: Thanks /u/unaspirateur for the delicious noms.
0	Title says it. Just a college lad trying to work my way through.  [This is all the charisma I can offer while at work.](http://www.imgur.com/q0xmV.jpeg)
0	Kicked out of my parent's house 3 years ago, living on my own. I've had to drop out of school this semester because I don't have anyone to cosign a loan for me, and I can't earn enough to pay for college. My job was far, and I had to wake up at 5am. I crashed my car falling asleep at the wheel three weeks ago. I lost my job because I couldn't come in the next day. Because I lost my job, I can't pay rent next month, and I don't know where I'll be. And today, I saw $5 in my bank account, and used $3 on fuel to make sure I don't run out of gas in the middle of the road. Sure I'm upset, but none of those things got to me. You know what did? 5 minutes ago I opened my fridge to see that all I have left is some mixed vegetables, and a slice of white bread.  There isn't much more to feel. Just defeat, I guess.  edit: redundancy
0	Recently had to pay my rent so now I have no pizza moneys. Assistance would be grearly appreciated :D
1	Hi RAOP, there are some great offers up right now but most don't seem to be drawing for a few days. That's nice but by tomorrow morning I'll actually be able to grab some bare essentials like milk, eggs, bread, and cereal. I was just wondering if somebody could help me out because my only option here is to heat a can of tomato puree.   EDIT: I'm in the northern suburbs of Chicago.
1	I have to survive somehow until next Friday, when I get paid, until then I have to survive day-to-day and eat anything I can find. On my way home from work, I remembered this sub-reddit, I'll be happy to pay it forward regardless if I get helped or not. This situation has made me realize what how difficult tough situations can be.
0	Rent is due, he was late, and we are all broke. A pizza will be great. A reason to shoot him will be Amazing. 
0	I am sooo high... I ate my last puppy on Wednesday and my last kitty yesterday. I  have a few more bowls to get through and dont have no fooooddds. I tried to catch my neighbors cat but it ran away. Id go have some Chinese food to match my love of cat and dog but I have no moneys. PLEASE PLEASE I need a pizza, Im seeing stars and rainbows and aint close to emptying this bag yet.   Edit: Forgots me location: Im in Bangme, Mars.
0	Just heard about this and rather than request a pizza for myself I thought how fun would it be for a surprise pizza to show up for the Adoption and Lifesaving staff at the animal control shelter I volunteer with several times a week.  Its a rainy and miserable day, the shelter is extremely overcrowded meaning the days are stressful and filled with tough decisions being made for space.  I wouldnt want them to know its from my request but just a random act of Pizza sent there way for all their hard work.   The staff are there until 8pm Eastern time.  Im actually headed over to walk some dogs this evening and would love to see them enjoying a surprise pizza :)    Even if we cant make it happen tonight..maybe another night/afternoon this week.   Pizza can always make a bad day a little better! 
0	Just as the title says.. I'm on contract right now, and only get paid once a month. Overspent a little last month, and now I'm stuck broke until my next check comes in.. Which might be tomorrow, or it could be late next week.  Will gladly offer a pie after I get paid.
0	We walk thru the woods in search of werewolves.  We walk thru the woods at night.  We aren't afraid of them at all,  unless they try to bite!  Alas our pockets be empty And we're quite in need of a munch But if you'd send us a pizza, We'll gladly eat it for lunch!  (Thanks for your consideration, any pizza store would do)
1	College student here, out of luck lately. Out of a job for a while, and just spent $300 on textbooks for summer classes. I've been living on rice and ramen lately, and would really appreciate a warm pizza for a change. I'll be sure to pay it forward the moment I get my next paycheck.
0	Hello RAoP,  Today I knew when I woke up I should just go back to sleep, but against my better judgement, I hopped right up and went to class.  I've been having car trouble for the past two weeks, but I got a new fuel pump put in last week and I was fine.  Until today.  I broke down at a red light on my way to work, where I was hoping to make tip money and eat. This was unsuccessful, as my car broke down again about a mile from my house on my way there.   I completely wiped out my bank account last week fixing it + the tow  today, so any help you guys can offer would be greatly appreciated!
1	This is my first time posting here after long lurking and it's kinda a long shot. I get paid on Tuesday but seeing how it's the first week of the month and all my payments are made I'm basically broke. If anyone can help that would be awesome.   Edit: I live in Miami, Florida
0	Requesting a pizza for a family of four in king george va to help celebrate our two kids doing so well and getting awards from school. I need a little help because I am not able to do so on my own.  If there is anyone who can help me, I would really appreciate it. Thanks for reading. 
0	Not real sure what to say here. I'm a single mom of 3, recently unemployed and trying to scrape by till I can get another job. I don't want to post a "sob story" type of thing so I'll keep it short. I'm broke, we are hungry, and a pizza would be awesome. Thanks. :)
1	My younger sister just moved into my apartment with me and we're a little tight on money until school starts (She works at the local university). If anyone feels it in their heart to order us a pizza or two I have a coupon code for Papa Johns that can be used for a one-topping large pizza for $5.99 at the local store. It's carry-out only but I can go pick it up :)
1	So my husband has gone to Michigan to be with his father who is dying from cancer. He is waiting until his first paycheck then getting our house and a u-haul and us lol. I am leaving my mother and sister behind, and am a bit nervous about it. So until I get there, everything is a bit limited! Would anyone like to spoil me and my two toddlers to a pizza dinner? =D  BTW, this is NOT a crises for food, we have plenty in the kitchen, just wanted something a bit more fun =D
0	i'm not really sure how to go about this, any advice welcome 
0	I'm 5 months pregnant with no food and i have a 3 and 5 year old. My husband worked through a temp agency and for the week of christmas his work slowed down so we are in a really tough bind with everything. we did get food stamps and i missed my review because i don't have a car. My kids are crying because they are hungry. so if someone could please help us out with a pizza it would really help thankyou and god bless.
1	Can you help make it a date night?  Here's the sitch (is that how you abbreviate it? I know how it's said, but I don't think I've seen it in writing....)  My girlfriend has been working hard to support us since I lost my job. Long hours, crappy boss, you know the drill.   About an hour ago I just got a short gig, so I can start to contribute again, but it will still be a while before we're back on our feet completely.  As I feel it is my boyfriendly duty, the least I can do for everything she does, I give her a lot of massages. Back, neck, arms, feet, I do it all baby! I'm rubbing those knots out like nobody's business.  But now my hands remind me of my grandpa's (except the skin doesn't look paper thin). Knuckles the size of cherries, stiff as a board. Ok so that's quite an exaggeration, they don't really hurt. But still.  I would love to be able to have a pizza tonight with her, as a sort of thank you type date thing, since we don't always get to eat together and it's never something you find on /r/FoodPorn  
0	So I had 100$ taken from my bank account by some fraudulent paypal scammer. Bank of America "investigated" twice and are now saying that the transaction was "authorized" setting me back a 100$ I don't have. A pizza would do wonders for my crappy, crappy mood right now. I'm located in Philadelphia.
1	i received once before from raop and i thank you, but i seem to have found myself at your mercy once again. up till Wednesday i had bout $30 to get me till payday. found out the hard way that businesses have up to a year to actually collect funds from a card purchase. it almost over-drafted my account but thankfully took some from my savings luckily saving me from a fee but also draining that as well. i am by no means probably the neediest person here, but today was another horrid day at my dead end job and some pizza love or hell even some kind words would help my mood. Again thank you all you everything you do here.  verification code available if anyone wants it.
0	If anyone feels like helping a sister out with a bit of pizza action, I'd *really*, truly appreciate it. Gave the last $20 I had till Wednesday to my boyfriend for gas money before he left for work....prrrrreeeetty hungry now with nothing in the kitchen. Thanks for any consideration.
0	hey, this is my birthday tonight, i'm looking for a friend, someone who can bring some happiness in my heart. what better way than a pizza ?  will food be my only friend tonight ?
0	We are having a muggy, pretty tame night &amp; we'd really like some pizza to jazz up our evening. Random nice things are pretty neat.
0	His business is not doing so hot (printing - just like from the show The Office hah.) and he hasn't been too happy about it. I know I could go out and get him a pizza but A) I don't have any money B) He would go completely crazy if he knew it was from reddit.   Thanks guys! This subreddit is amazing. I love you guys
0	Hoping to get a pizza before I just go to the library without eating anything today :)  love and pizza Dom 
0	Just moved to Iowa and have been looking for a job since the beginning of the month.  Had a really good job interview today and was wanting to celebrate with the wife.
1	I just paid my rent with the last of my financial aid money from last semester and Im sick and tired of eating canned meals. I feel like I'm a survivor of the apocalypse. Would a kind redditor help me out with a cheese pizza. More than willing to pay it forward when I'm in a better position.
0	my rent is due very soon so I need to save my money but its either this pizza or ramen (cliche I know)     If you are ever in the LA area I'll smoke you out one day! (If you like that)
0	I'm feeling adventurous. I'm also running low on cash until payday on the 10th. I'm in the spirit of giving, but would like to toss things up a bit- if you buy me a pizza tonight, I'll send you a surprise gift of equal value! 
0	Hey redditors,  I'll be upfront, this is a throwaway account.  I've got a little too much pride still to let people really know how bad of a situation I'm in.  To be blunt, my life sucks right now.  My wife left me about a year ago, the woman I've been seeing is now with one of my closest friends, I just lost my job 4 months ago, and the temp work just isn't out there.  The high point of my life right now is my little boy.  He's the best thing to come out of my marriage, I would do anything in the world for him.  This is why I'm coming to you Reddit.  My wife is bringing him back tomorrow, and I would love to be able to surprise him with some pizza.  The sad fact is though, I can't afford it.  Which is why I'm coming to you guys.    I've seen some amazing generosity on here in the past few days, and was wondering if I would be lucky enough to get some too.  
0	Hey redditors. I'm going to be hanging out with a couple of friends tonight and watching a movie. I've been off work sick for a while now and don't really have the spare cash for pizza currently. I'm not really struggling or starving. I just like pizza and haven't had any in a while. I would enjoy it greatly. 
1	Hey RAOP!  As a freelance writer and graphic designer, I'm always short on dough (both kinds...) I figured, why not have an exchange! I'll retouch 5 photos in photoshop in exchange for some cheesy goodness!   You'll get the finished JPG (and the PSD file on request!)  I live in Burbank, CA.  :)
1	The title pretty much sums it up.   I've recently moved back to the States from Italy. All my household items are on a large ship on their way over which means I don't have much to use for cooking in way of utensils.   I'm not scrimping for pennies but I am being frugal till I figure out my means here (especially since I'm on the hunt for a job) so if the Pizza Fairy is waiting for someone truly in need then wait for another post!   
0	http://www.reddit.com/r/Health/comments/11jtww/havent_eaten_in_6_days_feeling_dizzy_and_very/  Ignore the last comment, i feel like im dieing lol
0	Im currently in the roofing business, work extremely slow this month. My 7yr old daughter comes in town tomorrow morning money is bad right now and I wanted to get her her fav food this weekend. Haven't seen her since spring break she lives with her mother in Florida, looking to put a smile on her face this weekend. Thank You
0	[This sane family is going hungry because they refuse to murder their rape victim daughter.](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/ku0tg/pakistani_family_refuses_to_kill_daughter_who_was/)  "We go hungry many nights," said Kainat's older sister. That made me think of /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza. Are there some Pakistani Redditors that could help, or help us help this family?
0	Homeless man is a friend who just got kicked out of his house after getting out of rehab (kid has had a really rough year) and my roommates and I don't get paid till tomorrow and we have no food to eat tonight. This is my first post here so not sure what else I'm supposed to say, but if someone could help us out we would be extremely appreciative! Thanks!
1	[Request] Out of Saint Louis Missouri. (Specifically The Soulard Area)  So here is my story, Hopefully it will warrant delicious pizza..  For the past 5 months i have been an addict in recovery. At one point i realized i no longer wanted to keep living the way i was living.. Talked to my family and got help. I was addicted to Amphetamines and was starting to develop a bad heroin habit. I spend 42 days in rehab.. Came out with a new lease on life, and spent the next 3 - 4 months in a sober living facility. Just trying to remember how to live and enjoy life sober.. I got the best job i have ever had (Contracting for charter) and after a month i was promoted to be the south Saint Louis Market contractor. (Basically i managed all southern saint Louis contractors) Things were going great, With my new job i rented out a new apartment Set myself up a home office, and genuinely enjoyed day to day activities. Then one day, When i was heading back from a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, I got pulled over in Illinois (15 minutes from my apartment in Saint Louis) The Police Officer Informed me that i had an outstanding warrant in O-Fallon Missouri for Possession of a controlled substance. You see, I knew that this warrant was a possibility, But i had assumed they would let me know when they decided to issue the warrant! 6 months prior (Before Rehab) i had been arrested for Possesion and they had let me go, With no ticket, Not even a court date. Since that was my first serious charge ever i had assumed they would at least let me know if i had a warrant. Well. Long story short(er) I ended up spending 5 days in a holding cell in collinsville Illinois, 2 Days in Madison County, and 1 day in St Charles County. MY mother had got me a lawyer so that i could bond out (they didn't want to let me post 10% so without a lawyer my bond would have been 20,000) and ended up spending 5k just so i can hopefully keep my job.  She had hoped that by getting a lawyer and since this was my first offence, ever, We would be able to preserve my job. Well, No luck. I lost my job because of my 1 week absence and the fact that i had obtained a felony. Since i was a contractor i cannot collect unemployment.  So here i am. 1 month later. With barely Any food in my fridge, A carton of cigarettes, and an internet connection that will be shut off any day now. I have until the 30th of august before i get evicted, and am currently considering moving back into a half-way house. BUT i am STILL SOBER! Which i am proud of, Months ago i would have been wasted the second anything went wrong. So i come to you, knights of pizza, humbly asking to Make my evening tonight. I would LOVE to eat something other than macaroni and cheese.  I can prove any of it! i can provide pictures of: Graduation certificates, An empty fridge, a hungry dog, anything you can think of.. Thanks in advance.  TLDR; Living Life Like a boss, then old warrant came up, Lost everything because of bad decisions in the past.. pizza will help morale.
0	No sob story here. Just a little tight on cash until next Friday, and do not want to eat Ramen everyday until then. I make decent money for my age, but have to pay off college loans and other living expenses. I took some time off to do family stuff for the 4th of July and just didn't pull in the kind of money I'm used to these past pay checks. I'll be back to normal next Friday, but was just hoping I could have the indulgence of having a pizza before then. Hopefully I can repay the favor to another fellow redditor in need of some delicious cheesy goodness once I get my next pay check :)  (Northwest Florida Panhandle) if that needs to be clarified.
0	People owe me but are refusing to pay. I want to eat something real just one night. Sorry for the desperation.
0	kinda skint at the moment, no cigs, empty fridge and won't have any money until friday :( a pizza would really hit the spot and cheer me up :) I've been in this predicament before and have considered asking here but I've never found it easy asking for stuff, letting pride get in the way I suppose, will pay it back when I can.
0	Most of my money has been frozen online since April 15th and the rest of it is just about cleaned out from the past 2 months. I'm running out of things to eat for dinner and was wondering if any kind humans would like to help out for a night.
0	Can definitely use the verification system, I live in ohio and can give you a pizza place number if you want or the places in the area. I don't have any gas to pick it up and won't till I get paid. Thank you for any help!
1	Hi RAOP! I'm currently a grad student and I don't get paid until next week and really really hungry. If anyone could help out with the gift of pizza (trust me, I can make it last for at least a few days), I will buy someone a pizza the day I get my paycheck in (I think it's next Friday). Thank you :D
0	i'm a 22 year old part time college student (anthropology). alcoholic dad kicked me out last night. parents got divorced and can't stand my stepdad. this is so pathetic but my bank account is at zero and i have no cash. living off mcdonalds dollar menu for lunch.  quick edit: Hunger really makes you realize how much the world has to offer, and how little you have. got my verification code thing too.
0	I'm majorly fatigued right now with a headache and a sore throat, and I don't feel like cooking at all (and all I have is ramen to cook anyway.) It'd make my day if somebody could hook me up with a pizza. Thanks in advance :)
0	Both of us are college students and he's always hooked it up with a meal or some type of grub when I've been down on cash. Just looking to return the favor as we're both in the shit now. Have to use what little cash I do have left to get me to classes next week. :(
0	I am a college student, but I have no home. I've been sleeping on couches and making it by on very little food. I finally have a job that can support my living for a few months, but I'm extremely broke and its very far away. I have a bus ticket, but I'm down to ten dollars and I just don't know how I'm going to eat until I get a paycheck.  Thank you for reading if you made it this far. I know it would be very easy to ignore this. But a random act of generosity could sustain me in body and soul for a few days longer.
0	Today is my birthday! sadly there's nothing to do here at all. i have no money. neither does my family, who isn't here, so i'm alone on my birthday with no food really. i mean we have some bread and some milk and some rice i think in the fridge but i've been eating that for weeks. My girlfriend just broke up with me on friday too.. so i can't really do anything today.. also i'm being picked up at 6 for work so ya.. i could really use some pizza today for my birthday. there's a pizza place near me called new york pizza girl the number is (610) 681-4900, PM me for my information, if you'd like to give me a birthday present that is
1	My 6 year old autistic son, and my 4 year old daughter are finally back in our home after along battle with social services, the problem is that right now we have 5 more days until our food assistance kicks in for the month, and we don't have much of anything to eat. we could really use a helping hand for them, their mom, grandmother, and myself. I feel worse, because I turn 36 in 8 days, and haven't worked in a few years. between the out of work situation, and dealing with both kids disablilities, you can only imagine the stress. My entire family would be so grateful for any help we could get. thanx to anyone willing to help.
1	Work is horrendus. Not only that, but that stupid time between school ending and work picking up means i have zero cash. You guys seem kinda awesome. this'd be an interesting first reddit! X) Thanks even if you just read this X3
0	My team and I are working on a Thermal Systems Design project in the library. It's our senior year in Mechanical Engineering and the workload is really starting to pile on. We've been in here all day and haven't had a bite to eat yet. Some team pizzas would really boost team morale right about now so we can power through this project and get it done today! :D
0	I am an education major at West Virginia University. I have very lean means, and frankly, I am starving and would love some pizza. I promise to somehow pay it forward, I just really am hungry right now. 
0	I'm pretty hungry right now and jonesing to get my gaming on this uneventful Saturday night.  Any help would be great!  I'm in the Tucson, AZ area.
0	**EDIT: NEVER MIND! Since we couldn't hang out, my girlfriend made me and delivered dinner! Here's my sob story anyway**  I never really did this before so I'm not sure how it works, and from the looks of how many people are posting and asking for pizza, I probably wont get any, but it's worth a go. My grandfather has been in the hospital for a week and my mom just went in this morning because she has pneumonia. My dad, who is still in the middle of work, just drove my sister to her soccer game and is going to visit my grandpa, then to visit my mom in a different hospital, then going back to work. He came home for a half hour and he said I can't leave the house because I have SATs tomorrow morning and no one can come over because no one is home. When he left he told me we have nothing to eat and to buy my own food tonight and he'll pay me back. I just checked my wallet and I remembered I just spend my only $20 to buy a prepaid card to buy a game on Steam last night and I'm kind of regretting that now. Now I'm stuck here alone for two hours until my sister gets a ride home from her soccer game and who knows when my dad will be home. No matter what time he gets home, I still wont be able to eat. So all I'm asking for is a small pizza for one so I can eat tonight.  TL;DR: Grandpa and my mom are in the hospital. My dad drove my sister to her soccer game then has to visit two different hospitals before going back to work. Home alone. Can't buy pizza because I bought a game last night with the last of my money.
0	I have no pity story. I'm not poor (well...I make enough to survive), and I'm not starving. I'd just really like to celebrate. I think I did pretty damn well in the interview, nerves aside. If I get the job, I'll be able to actually make some pizza dreams come true.    I solemnly vow to randomly pay the random act of pizza forward. I'll probably buy somebody a pizza in the future anyway...but I'll make it my duty if a kind stranger were to hook me up. Hell, might even throw in some wings or breadsticks.
0	Long story short, Ramen diet for the past 2 weeks, roommates mad that rent hasn't been paid, not sure if I can even make it to work tomorrow, no cash until later in the week. My life is a fart. Thanks for reading.
0	Hey all.  Didn't get to eat much for dinner last night and I am not getting paid until tomorrow. Could really use a pie for lunch, I'll even share it with coworkers. *Pay it forward* right?  I'm not sure exactly how this system works, first timer. I did the verification code thing but it says not to post in thread.  There's a couple pizza places really close to my work where I can go pick it up on my lunch break (anywhere from noon to 1pm). I'm eastern time zone.   * Neighhood Pizza Company: 905.984.5555 * Boston Pizza: 905.688.0273   Thanks for looking!
0	Planning a cross-country move in a week (Davison, Michigan to Maine), but currently broke and living on ramen and occasionally my roommates' leftovers. I would seriously appreciate a break from that, even a small one. There's a Pizza Hut and a Hungry Howie's (Michigan chain) near me that both do online ordering, and they're about the same price but only Pizza Hut does gift cards, so I'm not quite sure how to go about it. I've only gotta feed myself, so I don't necessarily need much. I can try to pay you back, if you don't mind it possibly taking a while- I'm moving to look for a job.   P.S. If either of my roommates see this: Hey guys look, there's a subreddit for this!
1	I had to pay to get my car repaired this week, leaving me with little money until next Friday when I get paid again. Some pizza would be really amazing. I would definitely pay it forward when I get paid next week.
0	Here's the web you can order from: http://www.telepizza.es/  In the name you can put "indignados".  Barcelona address: plaza Catalunya s/n  Madrid address: plaza del Sol s/n
0	Hello RAOP'ers, I'm Galus and I'm from Clearwater, FL. I've been spending my time sitting around hungry for the past couple of days and broke for the last two months. My friend &amp; fellow redditor /user/stevenjohns/ told me about Random Acts of Pizza and I thought I might give this a shot, what can I lose, my pride? School is starting next week and I'm trying to stretch out the last of my money till my scholarships and grants come. Because I've been broke, i've been staying in doing nothing but coding and gaming. I don't know what much more to say other than this is me: http://mariuszgalus.com , in the past week i've been trying to help out my dad's business (not going well) by redo-ing his entire site http://bmhardwoodfloors.net AND my new site (cool css3 stuff! ) http://mariuszgalus.com/newsite which I can't wait to deploy. I also have been coding for 64labs.com but the CEO told me he had no money to pay me. I thought it was my big break to getting a job. In the end, i'm hungry. I just signed up for EBT/food stamps. -_-  Here's a picture of my bank account http://twitch.tv/saionjik  Have a good day guys
1	Lost my job in August. Was my own damn fault but still have not found anything.. Just feelin a little bummy and need some comfort food.
0	My mom's Gallbladder removal was supposed to be a routine procedure but ended up being twice the size of an ordinary one so removing it was a complicated procedure. Once it was out she was left with a giant scar and is now in a bunch of pain she even attempts to get up and walk around leaving me the responsibility to do everything around the house. It's been about a week and I've been able to magically make whatever we had left but now I'm running out of money and energy. So if you can please let me know, Thanks.
0	Out of work right now. Looking for a new job. Got home last night, ate lasagna, went to bed and woke up puking into my trashcan around 4 hours later. I've spent all day in bed feeling like shit instead of out applying at places. I only have 200 bucks in my account and I have no idea how long that'll have to last me. I'd be willing to repay the favor with my first paycheck.  Because I live in a guest house Dominos is a must. The pizza tracker tells me when to expect delivery and go to the main house, meaning I can wait in bed while it's cooking.
0	I have one cup of ramen left, and I don't get paid until next wednesday. Could really use some pizza to last. Will pay it forward in the future :)
1	My son has recieved his meal, thanks veritas27!  My son is in dire need, I'm from Central California, a mother of 5, and cash is really tight here at home. My oldest child joined the Army in December of 09, he had just turned 19 then, however during his training at Ft. Benning he substained a back injury and was medically released from the service in Aug. 2010. It happen 2 weeks before his graduation he was on his last phase, I had bought my non refundable airline tickets a few days before that had happened. He came home and literally had to be on his back for 6 months, we didnt have the money nor insurance for him to get proper treatment, nor was there any offered to him by the Army, he toughed it out but he fell into deep depression.. by Feb. this year, he started training himself in shape, and began looking for any work, unfortunately nothing came up, that only lead to him feeling more depressed, having to see his dad work long hours at a very labor job to support all of us, he couldnt bare it and decided to take a chance in another state, hes in Portland, OR. right now, with his cousin, still trying to establish himself there, he's been there for about a month struggling, he just got a mailing address and now he can get an Oregon ID, right now he just haves his military ID, he doesnt except any cash from me, cause he says he rather it go to the babies (his little sisters 5 and 6) I worry about him eating constintly, instead i dried some cheap beef to jerky, and boxed some ramens to him. My son is struggling to get something started, I pray that something good will happen for him, and I think that something like this, would lift his spirits, that someone was thinking of him..
1	Hi guys,  Normally I'm not one to ask for charity but I *really* need some help this time. I've been working a crappy, minimum wage job for the past year, and I finally got a new position working in a dental office (which is what my degree is actually in, but I haven't found a position until this past week), but I don't start there until mid-June. :(  My boyfriend, who I live with, got laid off this past March and applied for unemployment benefits shortly after, but of course, nothing has been solidified on that end yet. I'm sure it's to everyone's surprise that the unemployment office isn't super reliable, right?...  So, I am here asking for some kindness to be brought upon us, as these past few months have been particularly trying for us financially. I am also in the process of recovering from a bad car accident a few weeks ago, so I've also had to worry about finding a new car, as well as trying to find a new, cheap apartment since our lease is up in July. Sigh. Growing up sucks sometimes.  To anyone that even took the time to read this, thank you! And if anyone even considers doing this favor for us, I promise you will be repaid in some form or another! You have no idea how much it would mean to us to not have to worry about dinner tonight. We are genuine people, we have just fallen on some hard times.  **Thank you!**
1	I had applied for this job that would have been perfect for me.  My current job is so stressful it puts me in tears every other week, and with Christmas coming it is just bound to get worse.  I went in and interviewed and they said they would talk it over.  They hadn't expected to hire anyone but my application had skills on it that are just rare and they could use.  (i worked in an engraving/framing shop, and they have an engraving part to their store)  Turns out though that my available hours just aren't what they're looking for.  I can either compromise my study time for school to take this job, causing me school stress, or i can stay at my already shitty place but not have school stress.  Either way, stress.  So i'm bummed, and could really use a pizza.  Or better yet, subway, since i'm supposed to be on a diet/making a life change.  But today i just don't care as much about that as i should.  Between finding that out, and my desktop computer with all my awesomeness not turning on yesterday, my thanksgiving break has just been shit.     (No idea what's wrong with the computer.  it's getting power, but when it turns on it sounds like eight hundred fans turn on inside, and it never goes to a login screen.  I don't know enough about computers to fix it. That was usually the ex-husbands job)  long story short, my computer is broke, and i didn't get a job that would have made my life hella easier.  I'm bummed and want to eat comfort food.  fyi- would have to be for pickup.  I live too far out for delivery. 
0	Spent the last of my money on bread for soup this morning. Won't be getting money until Monday when banks open so it could be a rough weekend and I have exams starting Monday. Any help appreciated, thanks guys.
0	Hey reddit im really hungry and have no money left for food. this is my last resort for the day. if anyone is feeling generous it would be AMAZING.
0	We're 2 dog groomers in between paychecks, no one's been tipping and we don't have anything for dinner :(  We would really love some pizza right about now! If anyone's feeling generous we would be more than happy to pay it forward on our payday! :D Much Love, 2 Stoner Chicks
0	After rent, my portion of the utilities and a few groceries, I have less than a dollar in my checking account. I get paid every other Friday and this is an off week. I did grocery shop, so I won't starve, but there is only so much ramen (with egg and sricha!) that one can take . tonight is my night to hunker down and do all the homework. So if any kind soul wants to spot me for some pizza tonight, that'd be pretty awesome. :) 
0	Finally on the upswing and have regained my appetite so a pizza would be exceptional right now.
1	(A bit of background: I broke my foot in May and since I lived alone at the time and was unable to use the 3 flights of stairs to my apartment, I moved back in with my mum for assisted living, basically--until I can get back on my feet. **I'm still in a effing cast! UGH!**)  ANYWHO, we're leaving this evening to visit my grandma 12 hours away and mum's still running around trying to get everything ready for our trip and as much as she can for when I return home, seven days ahead of her. I'm trying to help where I can, but there isn't much I can do with a broken foot. Having a RAoP delivered (I broke my driving foot) would accomplish a number of things: **1.)**Resolve the issue for the last meal in town. **2.)**Not dirty any dishes for her to wash.  **3.)**Be a way I can "help"/show my appreciation. It's something nice for her and she totally deserves it.  We live in Tennessee and I would be happy to answer any and all questions anyone asked. :)  **EDIT** Request fulfilled!!!! mayquiri rocks my socks!  http://imgur.com/BOjTu
0	Just seeing if anyone feels like buying my uncle and I some pizza tonight! :)
0	Gonna be a long long night
1	Hello RAOP,  figured I'd give posting here a shot. I've been out of work for about six months now, applied literally everywhere in walking and bus distance. I still live at home, and on top of stretched funds, my mother's card recently got overcharged and left us with $15 for two weeks. She gets paid in a few days but I think instead of coming home and going straight to bed, a pizza might really lift both of our spirits. 
1	About two months ago, myself and three friends from high school moved into a cabin in North Western Indiana, that was built by one of my friends father.  We resorted to the cabin because we all work at McDonalds and could not afford anything else.  The place needed a lot of work as no one has lived in it for fifteen years prior to us.  Raccoons had torn out most of the dry wall and even got inside the cabin.  Nonetheless we were really excited about the whole rustic feel that the cabin gave off, ...... until it started getting cold.  We have only had a few frost nights so far, but Winter is Coming.  Our Cabin is not exactly "factory sealed" and doesn't exactly have a "heater".  So as Northern Indiana's harsh winter approaches we are feverishly (literally and figuratively) trying to figure out how to heat our cabin.  If someone would like to buy us a pizza to lift our spirits we would be greatly appreciative and we will pay it forward.
0	Hey RAoP!    We just downloaded the installation for Final Fantasy XIV and we didn't really plan on the process taking so long.  Time flew by, and now we're stuck here, hungry and unable to play the game! Wife is preggo and craving some pizza! Help us! =D  Thanks!!!
0	Hey all, I just had a root canal yesterday and I don't feel like cooking the left over veggies. With rent, I am zeroed to only 50 cents in the bank. I just started a new job which takes 4 weeks to receive my first pay check. I've been relying on free food at work, vegetables and potatoes (we have a farm share at work). If you can help that will be great. 
1	We have a week left here in Colorado, before moving back to Indiana to start completely from scratch. Tomorrow my son turns 7 and he's so excited. He hasn't decided what he would like for his "birthday" dinner as it's just him and I, but I know he is leaning towards pizza.  With the cost of the move, and the deposit I had to give. I am scrapped.   This is not a need, just a birthday wish for some yummy pizza tomorrow to celebrate his birthday!   Thanks for reading!  [This was his first birthday!](http://i.imgur.com/PRPUdFt.jpg)  [This is him on field day for school](http://i.imgur.com/f1QlQAT)
0	My wife just lost her job, and her medication is failing her bipolar. I've just gotten a crappy grade on yet another test in managerial accounting. Its days like these that keep kicking you in the balls. A pepperoni and sausage pizza would make life so much better.  EDIT: Just found out that students don't qualify for food stamps. Stupidest. rule. ever.
0	Starving college student who's eaten frozen fish-sticks for the past few days and just looking for a good meal!  In return, when money is available to me, I will buy the person a pizza.
1	I'm just your average everyday dude, but lately I've been having a little crave for a goood pizza. If you could please grant me my request mankind, I'll forever be in your debt and sill surely lend a hand before thought! :D
0	I am a single dad living with my son and sick mother. I recently had to quit my job to stay at home with them because she can't watch him by herself while I work.The last of my money just went on the rest of my bills and we have no money to get any food. If someone could help I would really appreciate it and would return the favor when I am back on my feet.
0	Hey, I just moved into my first apartment and am a little short on cash until next week. Would love some pizza, don't care where it comes from.
1	Pretty much what the title says. I was on my way out to find something cheap to eat when I found out my car's engine doesn't start, and so I turn to reddit for help in my time of hunger.  Thank you for the opportunity. :)
0	I had no idea this subreddit existed. Very cool stuff.  Anyway, I'm supposedly going to start working an on-campus gig for the University of Arizona soon, but the person responsible for the job has been dragging their feet hardcore. Bank account is in the shit, I don't own any credit cards, and the only thing I have in my house is a can of tuna. I don't even like tuna.  Probably not as deserving as a single mom, but college kids gotta eat, too! And if you're a local I will take you out for a drink once I start working :)
1	I like pizza, you like pizza. PIZZA? 
0	I just got back home a bit ago and there's not much to eat (besides ramen, which gets old) and I finally have a day off tomorrow, so I would really appreciate any form of pizza right now to unwind. (Plus pizza is my life.) I'll get paid on the 4th of July and would probably return the favor!
0	I havent had a contract for a while and have been slowly running out of money and would love to have a pizza instead of tomato soap over ramen. Right now im throwing around some ideas for a new porn site but im running out of motivation maybe a pizza would help!  thanks reddit i love you all
0	Hoping to pay it forward when I get some extra cash. Pretty awesome sub even if I don't get pizza.
1	My family is so nice and awesome I would love to surprise them with pizza. &lt;3 thanks -Tif
1	My husband and I are buying our first new car today.  We are not in dire straights by any means, but buying a new car is definitely putting a huge dent in our wallets.  I would like to surprise my husband tonight with a celebratory pizza that didn't put any extra strain on our bank account.  The car payments over the next 5 years will being doing enough of that.  Thank you!
0	First time on Random Acts of Pizza, my wallet was stolen out of my car today and I am in a very miserable mood.  I am hungry and if someone would be so kind to give me a random act of pizza I would be very grateful.  In the future when I am in a more financially stable position I will remember the generosity and pass on the good deeds. BTW I &lt;3 Dominos pizza. Thanks!
0	If you could give us a pie we'll pay it forward when we can EDIT: We're willing to do almost anything within reason on camera for a pie, just ask
0	my family and i could use a pizza tomorrow we are all sick and dont feel like cooking if someone could help it would be great we have a pizza hut thats all we have here
0	I've been going to school at the art institute of wisconsin for about a year now, and since I don't actually live in Milwaukee and I'm kinda awkward, its a little hard to make friends. what better way than to offer them some free pizza and have a nice chat? would be much appreciated.
1	My husband and I recently got married and moved into a new place, spent money on rent, furniture, groceries. I just recently found a job but I don't start until next weekend. My husband is in the military but don't let that fool you, they give us just enough to pay our bills and we've been eating rice for days. I would appreciate any redditor willing to help us out so we can enjoy our saturday night together once he comes home from work. I will definitely pay it forward as soon as I start work next weekend! 
0	It's my friends IRL cakeday and he is home alone and he is broke so I'd like to have some thing for us to eat together when I see him today
0	We'll just say a cold beer is not the same when it chases a hot piece of pizza
0	~~Hi you guys. First I would like to say this thread and the people who frequent it are amazing. I've always been nervous to post here as I am usually too broke to reciprocate. I'm still broke, but when I get my tax return I definitely will reciprocate.~~  ~~A little about me and why I'm posting: I live with my mom and work a minimum wage job in Southern California. (North County)~~  ~~We have a three bedroom house that the bank is trying to foreclose on. Although this isn't a new situation for us, the guy who offered to do the home loan modification took two-thousand dollars of my and my mother's money and bailed. My mom's transmission also failed around last month so we've been taking the bus.~~  ~~We have been able to manage lately, until recently when my sister and her husband declared they would not be paying my mom rent for staying here anymore, and I found out they had only been paying my mom seventy-five dollars each for the past four months. It has been a pretty big blow, albiet not surprising, and has now put an even greater strain on my mom and I.~~  ~~As of yesterday SDGE came through and shut off our electricity. (I am writing via phone.) The bill is just over six-hundred dollars past due (I just found out) and my mom has been calling around trying to find help. I know it is probably stupid to request a pizza in lieu of everything else but I thought it would be a nice change from everything else going on right now.~~  ~~I know sob stories are probably cliche here, and my apologies for that. Just figured I would give it a shot. If anyone is interested, I can also provide pictures of the SDGE notice on the meter, or whatever else.~~  ~~So yeah. That's it. Thanks.~~  Edit: Overdrew the bank account to get the electricity back on, as it was needed for my mom. I downvoted my post, but just struck-out what I wrote so not to just simply delete as this board has advised against that.   *Mods can remove this if they want.*
0	Folks I need your help. My co worker has a cousin that is having a setback with Financial Aid. Her cousin has not eaten in 3 days. I know for fact my co-worker would not lie to us, we are a very close-knit department part of a major company. I have already [sent](http://i.imgur.com/i11XkFu.png) a Pizza Hut Gift Card for $25 and a few of us have already donated. Anything you would like to share as well would be appreciated.   She does not know I am posting this here, nor does she know what reddit is. 
1	Me and my boyfriend live paycheck to paycheck and we have about $40 to our name for the next two weeks :/ A pizza would make our week as well as a few meals! Hoping to get back on our feet next paycheck, and will absolutely pay it forward :)
0	Broke, My company is going bankrupt and owes me three weeks pay, I would appreciate some Pizza for me and my two kids..  Thank you
1	I haven't eaten anything in about 24 hours due to what I think was food poisoning. I'm better now and am enjoying non-sick life once again.
0	My family and I moved to Houston in our RV. Its me my wife, son and daughter, and my sons fiance. We are looking for jobs but wating on calls. Until we find jobs we have no income except for our food stams which we spent. A pizza or two would be nice for a meal for my family.
0	Hello, let me give you the story. I was kicked out on sunday and spent two days with a friend. My girlfriend was coming in from canada to stay at a hotel room which was supposed to be booked at $280 dollars. When she got here, the hotel came out to 460$. The extra money came out from our food fund, and we had about $20 for food and it ran out. We have been eating the little bit of snacks we have and its starting to make us sick. If you could spare a pizza please do. &lt;3
1	Thank you for taking time to read my post all the money my family has at the moment has gone towards the things I need for college while I wait for my financial aid check. I really expected to get it today but I didn't so now my family And I have no money to eat. I can pay someone back or pay it forward or both as soon as I get my check.
0	Hey all, I found this subreddit the other day and I think it's both hilarious and awesome what goes on here, and I want to participate.   After months of searching, I received a conditional offer of employment today! I'm very excited to start, but I still have some hoops to get through before I do (the conditions being a background check and drug test, both of which are all clean, so I'm not worried).   Seeing as how I'm currently a broke college student, pizza is an awesome celebratory food, but I can't really afford it until I start the job. If someone would hook me up with a pizza now, then once I get my first paycheck I would gladly buy them a pizza, or I could pay it forward to someone else listing a request.  I'd also like to make this interesting. I request that the kind, obviously good looking person who does this for me get me their own personal favorite pizza. There are no pizzas I've tried that I don't like, so don't be afraid I won't enjoy it. I promise I will. Or just troll me with the craziest franken-pizza you can design. I think that would be fun too.  EDIT: I'm located in Central Florida
1	Hi this week i got a speeding ticket running late to work and almost lost my job since the companies insurance almost dropped me (I work for a car dealership as a porter). So i had to dig into my food money to pay it off and ive been bumming food for lunch all week and am all out of rice and bread (dinner of champions) so i was wondering if anyone would be willing to help me out since it's been a rough week.
0	A pizza tonight would be absolutely wonderful, but I'm on a beans and rice budget until I can finally find a new means of employment. I reside in Walnut, California. We have a local Pizza hut, and there's a Domino's and a Papa Johns just down the street from my place. I'll gladly accept absolutely anything, from anywhere. Even something as simple as plain cheese would be awesome. I'm a cheap date.   This is my first time posting here, so I'm not entirely sure how this works. I'll keep tabs on my post over the course of the next hour or two in the hope it's seen by anyone willing to help. In return I can either pay it forward when I can, or order a pizza for you down the road once I'm back on my feet. Thanks in advance  :)  *Edit - I know, I know....my choices aren't exactly ideal, but alas those are the three closest options. I'm not exactly in a position to be picky, so even Domino's sounds great right now. But I don't have a preference between the three. Whatever is the cheapest still works for me.   *Edit 2 - If you were planning on ordering a pie or two tonight and you're willing to share, I'd be happy to join you as long as it's a public setting. I'm still unsure how this all works....am I supposed to provide a phone number and an address to someone via PM?   *Edit 3 - Well, this isn't getting any attention and my stomach is gurgling all the same, so I'm just going to scrounge for the evening. Short of a miracle in the job department I'm still going to be nearly broke tomorrow and a little while beyond, so if anyone would like to help me out another day, that would still be great.  
0	It's rainy season here and Seattle, and I haven't yet mustered to courage to go outside. Let me (and the dog) stay inside, in my leotard (and in her bear outfit), and eat dinner! I will photograph and submit several images of myself eating said pizza while in a handstand and/or various acrobatic acts. All, of course, in the name of proper digestion.  Thank you!  
1	Hey, doods! I'm currently a rising sophomore studying for midterms coming up, hopefully some pizza could relieve some stress..., and some hunger. I would appreciate the help and return the offer someday when I get my paycheck.  Thank you!
1	I got pizza'd, thanks Lexically. 
1	[PIZZA RECIEVED] Thanks so much iweararubber. Got dinner and lunch for the next few days.  You're a life saver!  
0	Hey Reddit, I'm a 20 year old female, I'm currently starving or at least it feels that way. I haven't ate anything since yesterday morning. I tried to go to the pantry today but they aren't open until tomorrow and tomorrow I wont need help because I get my check. I work a full-time job and currently drained my savings for a car so I didn't have to ride the metro back and forth to work.  I've been on Reddit for over a year and helped a lot of people out in r/assistance, if someone could help me out it would mean a lot, I'm currently extremely dizzy and I think it's due to the lack of food. Please PM for proof and my real account name, I'd be glad to pay it back or pay it forward.   Edit: If someone would still like to help I'd appreciate it, I can't pick up my check until 5PM tomorrow so it would be awesome to wake up to something.   Thanks.
0	ok, so heres the sitch, i quit my job a month ago, i had money set aside for rent and such, but it took longer than i thought to find a job. i now have a job but wont get my first paycheck for about a week. i have no food and havent ate all day. if you read this and think i deserve a pizza let me know. thanks
0	If anyone could spare a papa john code or wanna trade for amazon lemme know.
0	perhaps too long of a title seeing how that covers it all pretty much. 
0	we have just goting out of food for a few days and my wife has been in and  out of the er for asthma attacks and stuff to do with her heart we have no money for food because of that and we wont love to have a hot meal to feed 7 of us tonight first time to this site so forgive me if i do something wrong.

If anyone can help me out today with a pizza for him I'll be glad to pay it back when i get some money or my first check. Thank you all so much.    PS. Sorry I;m in KY btw

0	Have officially used up all my gas trying to find a job as of today, and the only thing in my kitchen is a loaf of old bread. Paying forward pizza will be at the top of my to do list, but nothing is expected seeing all the help going out to Boston:]  &lt;3
0	Hellooo Redditors. I'm 22 years old and on my own for the first time, thousands and thousands miles away from anyone related to me, and my dog. I just got a new job, work 70 hours a week, make close to no money, and never have time to eat. Being so far from my family for the first time kinda blows, but I'm also proud to be doing it!  Pizza. Pizza is all I want. I just moved from a tiny town in Maine, where the closest real pizza was about 2 hours away. Besides craving pizza, I crave a filling meal, as I don't have the money or time to eat. (Rare day off)  EDIT: Totally forgot to put in that I live in Marietta, GA
0	Having a very bad week and I have no dinner to eat.   Thanks if you do!
0	Would love pizza for me and the family on Tuesday so I wouldn't have to heat up the kitchen making dinner! Having trouble with the wiring that runs the window A/C so can't run it during the day, it shuts down the breaker for the room; and while I was able to get out today and stay cool, tomorrow I will have to stay home &amp; cope. Thanks for reading!
0	College student and I've lived mostly off of rice, oatmeal and a starbucks gift card I found in my apartment for the past 2 days. I could really use something more substantial but true to undergraduate form I'm out of cash right now. A delicious meat and veggie topped pizza would really hit the spot. If I'm honest I could bum some sandwich money off a roommate and overall I'm hardly in dire straits but I'm sick of hitting my friends up for minor things. Just a college student with a stomach that's as empty as his wallet. I'd love a pizza to study with tonight and to eat cold for breakfast tomorrow morning.
1	Thanks yall!
0	Hiya Reddit! It's my wife's birthday today and I was hoping someone would be willing to part with a pizza to help her cope with being.... MID-20s (gasp, horror)
0	Shit ima get downvoted to hell. 
0	I'm having a major craving for stuffed crust pizza. Haven't had it for 5 years.   Edit: It's my first post here so let me know if I'm doing anything wrong.
0	Basically, my pregnant girlfriend and I have been getting screwed over by a friend that owes us money. He was supposed to pay us the day after last pay day, but didn't.       For the last week we've been stuck splitting a 6" Subway sub every day (She gets a free 6" for working there). A pizza would be very much so appreciated, by me, and I'm sure it'd make a craving packed soon to be mommy very happy as well.       Regardless of if anyone helps us out or not, I'll be sending a pizza someone's way when I get paid.    Thanks for reading guys.  -Shane
0	I'm gonna be home alone for a while, and I want food. Stupid reason, I know, but hungry men can only think stupid.
0	Studying for the bar exam is a nightmare. Care to brighten our day?
0	My parents are visiting my Uncle in Vermont have no service to provide me with money to order dinner for the night. My University ID was stolen from me and since I dont have money I cant get a new one, Pizza would help me get through this weekend until I can get a new one! Please Help 
0	I move soon but in the mean time, I'm saving everything for the deposit and furniture, since I have none. Anyone care to donate a pizza? I'm in Delray Beach, Florida.
0	I took an online calculus class (big mistake) followed by an online calculus 2 class (even huger mistake).  I'm taking the calc 2 final tonight and after getting A's on all of my assignments and studying for days, it's looking like it won't go good.  Pizza would really hit the spot.   ALSO - If someone does end up buying the pizza, you can watch me eat it on skype.
0	I'm just a poor college kid begging for hand-outs.  I've been out of a job for a month and a half and haven't had much luck yet (not for lack of trying or interviews).  To qualify for food stamps (which I was using) you must work 20 hrs. a week if you're in school, at least, so I didn't get that this month and I'm broke.  I would love something greasy and cheesy (and mushroomy?) that is not canned black beans and white rice.  I can offer silly drawings in paint, help build something in Minecraft, perhaps even your own song if you can wait a week... make that two weeks (I'm kinda sick and don't really have a singing voice right now)....  Anyway, I also need a tablet, but pretend it's a really good drawing of me and comparably pathetic to a sad puppy: http://i.imgur.com/7EqsN.png  Edit: I live in central Wisconsin, US.
0	We are a family of 3 wanting a dinner of pizza. We have barely any food left this month food-stamps dont come in till the 6th. My 3 year old loves plain pizza and bread sticks. We are a very low income family trying to make it until my boyfriend finds a job. 
0	No sob story. I am just hungry and would enjoy a pizza. I usually only eat organic, but, today I would like a pizza for lunch. I guess I should tell you  about myself! I am a 20 year old female in nursing school (I love it!) I am either going to be a flight nurse or psychiatric nurse. I also volunteer at the gift shop, at my local hospital, because I love to socialize and meet new people. If there is anything you would like to know about me, feel free to ask! 
0	I'm making a pit-stop in Denver right now and am staying at a friend's house, so delivery pizza is a possibility for me for the first time in about 2 months. Also yesterday was my 24th birthday and all I ate was ramen and a pack of oatmeal. If you buy me pizza it will be obvious to everyone that you are cooler than a pack of peas :D.
0	Hey guys today I worked for the first time in over a year and will do again tomorrow (Unfortunately this is only a one off Job and I may not get another for a while). However it feels great to have worked again and I'll be earning some cash in hand money tomorrow :D. Anyways I would love a pizza and would reciprocate as soon as possible (But seeing as I don't have a job and the money for this will go towards paying rent to my family -Recent college (high school) leaver it probably won't be for quite a while) cheers! TL;DR Worked first day in over a year one off thing would love an happy time pizza.
0	I could sure use a pizza.  I lost my job and have two Anatomy tests to study for.  I'm studying the digestive system so I am sure that eating pizza will help me pass my test as my own digestive system digests things.  There is a domino's a few blocks from me.
0	Hey, guys. I know it's going to sound like kind of a sob story, but it's more stressful than sad for me right now. My grandmother died a few months ago, and since then, my grandfather's health has deteriorated rapidly. After weeks of me and my mom alternating between staying with him both at his home and in the hospital and going to my half-time job (an hour away from his house/the hospital he's staying at most of the time), I've had very little opportunity to be able to be home, and tonight is one of the nights I have off. My bank account is in the negative, and nothing aside from some cheese slices and my mother's frozen TV dinners are in the refrigerator.  I'd be more than willing to do some digital artwork with my tablet, or a physical and mail it/scan it in to you for basically anything.  I attempted using the verification system in the sidebar, but I'm not sure if it worked. I think it did, but I dunno.  Thank you in advance - you guys are the best!  EDIT: sorry, forgot to put where I am. Raleigh, North Carolina, USA.
0	You know that quote from Pulp Fiction about pride? It only hurts, it never helps. I've been learning that lesson this last few months.  Our household's budget is very, very tight. Basically, even though I have a full time job, I can barely make all the payments on a pile of medical debt. (A recent tooth removal pushed us over the edge.)  Well, if there's someone that could help us out, it'd be greatly appreciated. Cheers!  Update: Received a gift card from Gadianton. Thank you. You have done a great thing.
0	I was an asshole. I accidentally made my best friend wait for me for 2 hours outside my house... while i was inside the whole time. Asleep. I BLAME THE TWO ALARM CLOCKS THAT DIDNT GO OFF. It was the first time we were going to see each other in like 6 months, and I was a butthole. She's awesome and decided to come back, so I want to be nice and get her her favorite food- Pizza Hut cheese pizza! But I'm broke. So pleease help me look like less of an asshole? :D
1	Central Missouri, USA.   The current temp is 105. On the upside I got a potential job offer today! It only took about three months, too! :p !!  I would love some pizza tonight to restore some semblance of normalcy to my life... and after a lot of walking today, the idea of turning on the stove top to make rice again seems depressing.  A haiku to commemorate the day:  Eggs on car hoods fry   Pavement seems a bit sticky   Worth it, job offer.
0	So after 3 weeks of living off of ramen like some walking stereotype, I am in desperate need of solid food. My buddies were supposed to celebrate the end of the semester with me tonight but instead have abandoned me for their "girlfriends."(Pfft) I'm just stuck here on a Thursday with my penis and a laptop. Please help me get a little pizza love to keep me warm tonight.
1	didn't really think out my budget. have money for books but no food. you could make a poor college student so happy.
1	I'll be honest, there are other people here who probably deserve a pizza more than I do, but at the moment, a pizza sounds really good. As background, I'm a college student living in Hesperia, CA (AKA: One of the most boring regions of California), who is currently composing a sonnet for his Creative Writing class. I've been craving pizza for the past few days, but I haven't been able to buy any because of the financial aid office holding out on student grants/loans. A recent switch to a college debit card system has pretty much put a lot of people's money in limbo for the time being. This has been annoying, to say the least, since I have books to buy, a gas tank to fill, and an oil leak to fix as well.  Right now, I would only have my gratitude to offer as thanks. Anything would be appreciated.
1	I am Yet Another Poor College Student attending school in Portland, OR and times are tough.  I have had rice and potatoes almost every night for the past week and I would kill for some variety (and some scurvy prevention). I just got hired for a new job today, but I don't begin until the next semester in January, which is kind of a long time.  I mostly stay in lurk mode on reddit but if I get a pizza I solemnly swear to pop back in here when I have spare cash and pay it forward to some people.  In conclusion, http://i.imgur.com/KSzts.jpg
0	I won't have any money until Thursday and even then it's only $300; $160 of which will go to bills which leaves me with $140 for groceries for the entire month of October. I just want some food when I get home after my 9-9 classes today :( 
0	Had to pay off a huge vet bill and I'm broke until Friday.  Could use some pizza to have for dinner and take leftovers for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks!
1	I'll do anything for pizza, a dare, sing a song, whatever you like. No NSFW stuff though obviously. 
0	My boyfriend doesn't get paid until Thursday, we can happily repay someone or something after then. We have a package of Ramen for today, so I would prefer to have any donated food for tomorrow when we will have literally nothing, except 72 cents for cat food... because I'm not about to let her starve!  Anyway, I don't know much about these reddits but I thought I would give it a chance... I can message with you if you want. Also, it doesn't need to be pizza... we just want something to eat... but we don't have any gas in the car. Please help... Thank you for at least looking :)  EDIT: I can offer something, I can draw you a picture of anything you want, I can make you a necklace, take a photo, or any other artsy thing! =)
0	I'm broke right now but in a few weeks will be able to pay this forward and buy pizza for someone else - anyone willing to help me out and satisfy my pizza lust?
0	I don't get my loan for 2 weeks, can't stand the sight of rice anymore. Can anyone gift me something with flavour for a change?  Edit: going to bed now, my rice was terrible.
0	Goes great with Jack Daniels! :)
0	For those of you so kind as to offer pizza for others, I ask that you perhaps consider sending a pizza to those at Occupy Wall Street. https://occupywallst.org/  If you click on DONATE it will take you to their donations page.  About halfway down you can donate a pizza to them.  I'll paste the instructions they provided here as well.  Order Us Food Liberatos pizza – order online – order the “Occu-pie” Please order vegan or non-meat pizzas  Other local business that deliver  Here is the link to Order Online http://www.seamless.com/food-delivery/Liberatos-Pizza-Parmigiana-New-York-City.2674.r
0	My Son and I are at home without any way out due to car issues.  Will be able to pay it forward at the end of the week, but would love to share a hot pizza with him tonight.
0	As the title says, I'm currently 17, and living with my Mom that recently kicked Cancer's ass (I am completely unsure what type of Cancer it was/is) but she's having a tough time keeping a job and we barely have any food to eat. I don't really know of a way to prove this for some of the people that may or may not believe me.  Just hoping someone would be kind enough to send a Pizza our way, this was kind of a last resort, to "ask" or "beg" for food.  Anyways, Thanks for taking the time into reading this.
0	Worst week of our lives. My husband and I have been struggling to make bills and feed ourselves for the few past months. This week in particular has gone extremely down hill. We've been sick, without air conditioning in 90 degree weather, power would have been shut off if it weren't for my mother and every little thing in between. Today is our two year anniversary, and we are out of food and money until tomorrow. It would be nice to have some pizza for dinner if someone could help out.  Also, we have no internet, so I'm using my phone. Sorry if I'm slow to respond. :/   Thank you in advance if anyone responds. We aren't the type of people who like asking for help, it just seemed like a special occasion.
0	I am completely broke right now and have no food to eat except an old can of corn. The last of the money I had from my last couple shifts had to go into my gas tank so I could actually go to work tomorrow. I would be happy with any kind of pizza whatsoever(I don't really like pineapple but beggars can't be choosers). I am not sure what I can offer in return I can take a picture of myself acting a fool or maybe my cat who has a split paw. If you can find it in your heart to help me I will be forever grateful.
0	I'm in Covington.  If anyone would give the gift of pizza, I'd be most most appreciative.  I'm a broke writer who only had ramen in his house.  Thanks!
0	Hey RaoP! I'm writing on behalf of my roommates (and myself!) in request for some pizza!  We're extremely low on cash at the moment due to rent and the last bit of money we did have, we can't access due to a stolen debit card :(  If anyone would be willing to give us some pizza, we'd be really grateful!  My roommate, [Foolgroove](http://www.reddit.com/user/Foolgroove) will even draw you a picture :)  Thanks,  [Saeka](http://www.reddit.com/user/Foolgroove)  [Foolgroove](http://www.reddit.com/user/Foolgroove)  [Zonku](http://www.reddit.com/user/Foolgroove)

0	Please let me know if you could help me out. Broke college student starving alive in his apartment.
1	Hey reddit,  I'm; not gonna bore everyone with my sob story, but it's been a long hard road to find and get a job in this economy, and I couldn't be happier,  Sadly, my food supplies have run out for the rest of the week, and wondered if someone had it in their soul to help a guy about to turn his life around.  I'll be back on here ASAP to pay it forward when I can.
0	I haven't slept in 2 weeks. I discovered those 5hr energy type drinks and well... I have a ton of work from work and a ton of free lance work. A pizza would cheer me up and I will gladly pay it forward at the end of the month when I get paid.
0	Unfortunately, chicken ramen doesn't hold a candle to a pizza. I could sure go for a pizza, will pay it forward as soon as possible. Thanks. 
0	Hey! Both of us havent got time to cook much, and yesterday, i made a realllllly shitty pizza, and spent all the flour i had left on it.  Thanks a lot! 
0	Hey everybody, I just found out about this subreddit and I am requesting a pizza pie. Simply put, my dad has been in the hospital for a long time and is awaiting a procedure for this upcoming week. My mom is always at work and the hospital with him and whenever I'm home I have to find something to cook. Any kind of help would be amazing. Thanks.
0	She always feeds me and her boyfriend, who is my roommate because we are both penniless students. I love her and I want to give back so a pizza would be loved, ate and appreciated!
0	hungry pre-vet student in chicago studying for midterms would love a small cheese pizza from papa john's.  it would make her and Chessums very happy.  http://a8.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc7/s720x720/377322_153562588077598_100002715727381_169060_1155192583_n.jpg 
0	Would really appreciate some help, all my friends/ housemates have gone home for the summer to their mum's cooking, whilst I'm still here at uni and haven't eaten in 56 hours. And whatsmore I'm completely broke! Please help me out if you can! [UK]
1	Exactly what it says. I've been sick for the last couple of days and would love a pizza seeing how there's no food in the house either.
0	Been sick for a few days and I'm starting to run low on food, been eating   chips, ramen and other similar food items. I'll probably have to venture out to the store at some point, but I'd like to avoid the embarrassment and health risk of throwing up on the drive there and at the store.
1	Hello, I've just really had a bad week.  To sum things up, I found out my wife cheated on me 9 days ago.  I've since moved, but my fridge is empty and I'm basically broke due to the move until the 17th.  If you want more details please just look at my post history, but I'd rather keep all of that out of this thread.       I really just want some warm pizza to eat while I watch a few movies with my dogs.  I know I'm posting this on a throwaway account, but I wanted to explain the situation and can't use my main account to protect my self and my (cheating) wife.     Thanks.
0	**edit:** nevermind.
0	Me and my husband are college students at Texas Lutheran University. We don't get paid until tomorrow and are starving. We would pawn something however we have already pawned our engagement rings and have nothing else of value. Would be awesome if we could get a little bit of help
0	I'm hungry and I'm really not feeling the whole cooking thing while trying to wrestle two kids. My husband is unemployed right now, but as soon as he starts working, I'll pay the pizza forward!
0	Long story short, I came to a retreat, and could not stay due to health problems. I am now stuck pretty far from home with no ride until tomorrow, and I spent what little money I had on a hotel. Im really in need of something to eat, and will gladly pay it forward when I get home and have the chance.
0	This isn't for me but I have a friend who is in need but isn't a redditor. (That I know of). He became unemployed a couple weeks ago and he has barely enough food to keep his weight up. I am broke as hell and can't help him at the moment. All I have to offer is I will help someone at some future date in need.
0	Hey all, my coworker and I are stuck in an empty office for the next four hours with nothing but hard candy and empty stomachs. We're getting close to payday but until then we're both broke as joke. Anyone want to help a couple of hungry Georgia Peaches?
0	Just want to see if this place works!  Some pizza sounds great!
0	I know y'all don't wanna sob story, but I am pending unemployment benefits and could really use some grub. Any luck?
0	I have a 7 year old son named Isaac and we dont have anything to eat until friday when i get my check. We only a tiny thing of old leftovers in the fridge right now, just trying to make it a couple more days. If anyone could help us out til then I'd be so happy to pay it forward in 2 days, thank you all so much! 
0	Obviously i'm having a real bad night. started drinking heavily after i stopped crying  i really dont know what else to say  i dont wanna see anyone or talk to anyone right now
1	My mom's disabled and I lost my job about 2 months ago now.  We live from my unemployment check at the moment. I'm very grateful to even get that much, but it doesn't go very far.  I'm job hunting like a mad man right now but no luck.  A pizza right now would seriously lift our spirits, it's been a hard few weeks and a few canned veggies to munch on until my next check a few days away is hard going.  I'll do whatever is needed to verify whatever you want.  Not sure I could stand on my head and take a pic or anything like that, not very physically fit. &lt;3  EDIT:  Pizza is here!! Thank you so much again!! http://imgur.com/A4z8I  Check out my mom's awesome house coat! :)  leftnewdigg made our entire week, thank you!!
1	My friend Kate is one of the most talented special education teachers I have ever met and is an expert on assistive technology (namely communication devices). She gives voices to many people and has made the lives of countless individuals and their families better through her dedication and relentless work as an educator. She also happens to be the unluckiest person I've ever met - she currently has a broken foot, a uterine tumor, diabetes, a broken car all on top of being broke from student loans and medical expenses.   She posted a status on facebook tonight that said "At home 3 days with a broken foot, a broken down car and the bank still hasn't sent me a new debit card. Anyone who wants to pay to order me a pizza is welcome to, I can't take anymore Ramen. On the upside I get new X-rays tomorrow and maybe they can figure out why it hurts so much. And my car should be fixed by noon tomorrow." and I immediately thought of you guys at r/R_A_O_P and hope you are willing to help me help her out and let her know that the world isn't always out to rain on her parade. She is located in Massachusetts and I can provide proof if necessary (I'm kind of new to how r/R_A_O_P works so forgive me if I'm doing this wrong)
0	Just this Monday (11/5/12), in fact had an interview with McDee that went no where and on Tuesday (11/6/12), gonna be going to Stater Brothers for their open interviews, I'm getting in a terrible head space about this.   I'd love some pizza to cheer me on or just maybe celebrate a new job at stater brothers.
1	I'm watching my grandparent's house for the next few days and I have absolutely NO money and there isn't any food in the house. I've eaten all the cereal and applesauce in the house and would really appreciate it if someone could help me out with a RAOP. I will gladly trade pictures of my cat and/or my nephew for your karma pleasure.   **Chaska/Chanhassen/Eden Prairie-Minnesota**  **EDIT** Once my grandparents pay me I promise to pay it forward/back.
0	I go to school in Mississippi and haven't had a vegetable in 5 days. Pizza is a vegetable now, right?  Edit: I will get a vegetable pizza and provide pictures to verify pizza's veggie goodness. I think this is a big step for America.  Edit2: Some upvotes but no offers yet. I will also post pics of me SHARING my veggie pizza with a close friend of mine, who is a vegetarian. One large pizza should do the trick between the two of us, so a $15 eGift card or something would work just fine. Also I have paypal linked to my reddit email.  Edit3: Actually, I just won the college drawdown from BOTW. So please don't bother actually sending me anything now :) Much thanks to him for feeding a hungry college student. 
0	Hello RAOP!  As the title says our company's contract was terminated on Monday leaving me without work.  I did not eat all day yesterday as I've been too busy.  I have never tried this before but I have a craving for some pizza and thought I would give it a shot.   Looking forward to paying it forward once I land another job.  That's part of the fun.   Well, anyway, thanks for listening to my story.
0	I'm recently graduated college with a BS in mathematics and there is nothing I can find with it. I have no money and my Link card has been shut down so I can't buy food. I have no money because I put everything I had into paying rent for october. At the end of October if I don't figure something out I'm toast. All I'm asking is for some pizza. I haven't eaten today and the last of my oatmeal ran out two days ago.   If it matters I'm active in r/learnmath where I try to answer math questions related to combinatorics, probability, analysis, and Calculus.   If anybody decides to respond I have a verification code I can e-mail and I feel I would owe you eternally.
1	Hate to lay the sad story down thick, but can if needed. Not much of an artist, but will send a pic of three little thumbs up if we get lucky enough!
1	[I am a miserable failure when it comes to making anything. Even heating up corn dogs.](http://i.imgur.com/IxgXi.jpg)  I was given this convection microwave. I guess i'm not sure how it works fully. But there went my dinner for tonight. I might try corndogs again tomorrow night, as it's the only thing I actually have to eat, but well, tonight i'm a little bit frustrated with the whole corn dog adventures and my microwave (and house) smells like the inside of mordor.  can provide a verification code if need be.  If no one feels the need to help out, no worries. I'll figure something out. My dad bought me a burger for lunch today so I can make it till tomorrow. :) This place is still awesome.  EDIT: Forgot to add that i'm in Utah.
0	My debit card overdrew last night, and there's very little to eat here besides rice and corn tortillas. I'll have money on Monday, but I'd like to just eat something with flavor tonight.  Edit: I should have specified, I was hoping for just a cheese pizza from pizza hut or dominos. If you're feeling especially generous, a stuffed crust would be magical.
0	No money for groceries this week. All I have is ramen. I'm in the final stretch of this semester and I am pulling my hair out trying to get all my work done. A pizza sounds like Heaven right now! I'm in Columbia, Mo. I prefer an e-gift card, please.
1	Not really a sob story, just paid bills so I can't afford pizza for my wife and I. Really craving one. Thanks if anyone finds it in their heart to help out. :-)
0	Due to a doctor's visit and meds pick-up for a flare-up of asthma, I find myself housesitting tonight with no food left and no extra fundage whatsoever to go get something.  I'm in Disputanta, Virginia (part of Prince George), would appreciate any help!
1	Just moved to Austin Tx this year and not having the greatest time. My work cut hours, its hot and doesn't feel like Christmas, my boyfriend and I keep fighting and its bumming me out. A pizza that I could give the pizza bones to my dog would make both of us very happy. 
1	Nothing in the pockets or the fridge. I'd love to have some pizza tonight.
0	Hi RAOP. I'm starving, I could seriously need some pizza :/ I live in Denmark though.
0	Hey RAoP!  Tomorrow (Sunday Sept 22) is my only day off of work for the next 3 weeks. I would really enjoy being lazy and not having to cook, and with the rainy day that its supposed to be a pizza would be fantastic.  Will use Verification System.  I'm off to sleep for now, have a good night everyone! 
0	Yeah, going to be living off a lot of ramen for the next two months so was hoping that a nice redditor could help me out with dinner tonight. I'll also upvote all of your links because that's the least way to say thanks.
0	broke for another week was wondering if anyone could help me out with a pizza I'm in Phoenix AZ
0	I'm a college student with a midterm worth 30% of my grade tomorrow morning as well as two papers due. It looks like I'll be spending the whole night in the library working, and I could really go for some pizza. I am located in Wisconsin (USA) and Papa Johns is located on campus. If anyone would be willing to donate a pizza, I'd really appreciate it! 
0	Im sitting at home talking to some people online and i have a friend over.  We all just craved some pizza. I told them we would try this site out because we have no money. We have a dominoes nearby and i dont want to give my parents address out on the internet so i would love a giftcard.
0	Me and my friend are in desperate need of some food this evening, and we can't afford one of our own. We're stuck at our computers working on finals and a pizza would really lift our spirits!
0	Hey, I'm currently kicking an IV oxy and heroin habit and going through withdrawals and have no money so could deal with a free pizza.  I've never actually done this before so it'd be cool if someone could walk me through.    Location:  Southern Oregon  Note: Papa John's is the only one that will deliver where I live and I'd really prefer a gift card so that I don't need to give out my address.  
1	*just to be clear: by CA, I mean California
0	So I posted this on my facebook today:  "Hi, I'd really love a pizza and a handful of sedatives. First chick to furnish both wins a date with me and a pillow covered in drool."  A friend responded with this link. Nothing special about my story, but here goes. A bit over a year ago, I bombed out of college. Hard. After that, I was unable to find a job, even in the pizza industry, where I have 3.5 years experience, 1.5 of those in management. Throughout the year I have been bouncing around between cities, going back to Eugene and Corvallis for a time, and eventually went to Texas because I wanted to meet a girl I'd been talking to online for a year and a half or so and was quite enamoured with. That journey was a complete disaster, and months after I wound up back in Portland, I still think about it everyday. I still can't find a job... I interviewed at Voodoo Donuts the day before yesterday, and by now I would have heard back if I'd gotten the job. I feel like I kicked ass at the interview, but most 'cool' jobs in Portland are always won by scrubby hipsters and overly-tatted indie/rocker chicks. I'm an electronic musician, an artist, and writer, and slowly over the last year I've been watching a lot of the stuff I use to do my work break or disappear. My speakers broke, so I can't properly make music, I ditched 80$ worth of art supplies while I was trying to hitchhike to Texas, as it was weighing me down. My laptop's hard drive fried out but I was lucky enough to trade a much smaller one for some computer repair work. I've been couch-surfing various places this whole time, right now I am staying at a nice rasta lady's house with her schizophrenic ex-boyfriend and his mother, who has alzheimers. I'm lucky in that I get to stay in a room that is half-filled with their storage stuff yet has a bed in it. But I can't remember the last time I had a good pizza. Nevertheless, there are certainly people worse off than myself and if I had stumbled upon this sub-reddit on my own, I would've though that it was awesome, but would likely not be requesting pizza on it. However, since it was suggested to me, I figure I might as well give it a go.  What can I offer you? Well, I can send you a bunch of mp3s of my music, mail you some drawings, or perhaps help with some editing work if you have any writing you need someone to look over, whether for school or for personal writing. I live in the St. Johns neighbourhood of North Portland. Hope I got everything I need here, lemme know any questions or otherwise. Thanks reddit.
1	She loves pizza, and I'm really low on cash. Would gladly pay it forward. Thanks
0	I have nothing in my bank account and im hoping one of these really great givers can help me out. I just want something to eat for lunch, actually I could stretch a pizza for the whle week till I get paid thursday night. I will do any kind of verification you need, I'm just really hungry. THanks
0	Located in Ottawa, Canada  Due to some issues with a previous employer my wifes EI was cut really short unexpectantly. Because of this funds have been extreemly tight around the house. This week has been the first week back at school for my son who is in Grade 4. My son suffers from Aspergers and was really nervous about going back to schoo due to diciplin issues in the past. The last 3 days he has tried really hard and after speaking with his teacher today (She mentions hes putting lots of effort in) I would love to reward him with some nice yummy pizza.  Want to say thanks in advance! And I honestly cant wait to be in a better situation to return the favor to the community
0	Don't get paid until Next week, would like to enjoy a pizza for the holiday weekend with the kids, i would truly appreciate anyhting.
0	I've been near broke since late May and for the past 2 weeks I've been scraping by on my loose change while I wait for the first paycheck from a new job. I was told I would be receiving direct deposit by midnight of last night and I woke up this morning to... nothing. Lately I've been eating rice, .50 loaves of day old Jimmy Johns bread, and $2 lunch specials from this really great Thai restaurant nearby. But those can get pretty tiring after repetition.    I have just enough change to take the CTA to and from work for today and tomorrow and if don't get my money by then, well fuck, that's my own problem. I have $5.90 left in my bank account, which I'm keeping there as a kind of emergency buffer. Here's screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/w1Rs7.png  Anyone there able to help a hungry redditor out?
1	Hey guys, Philly redditor here. I lost my job last week and I've been getting by with cups of noodles and tuna and rice for the past few days, I'd really appreciate a real meal. My roommate's gone this weekend so this would be able to feed me for the next couple days.   I'm sure people frequently say "Oooh get me pizza and I'll get you back sometime pinky promise" and then never cash in on that promise. Well I won't lie. I'm pretty broke, and until August when new job starts, I can't promise I'll get you guys back. So no empty promises for now. But I can tell you guys I'm hungry and broke, and it would be amazing if any of you could help me.   Thank You
1	anyone could please feed a starving girl from south florida. last time i asked i went to sleep to forget my hunger, so i dont know if anyone responded. Ill try and stay up this time.  thanks in advance
0	I'm not asking for pizza for myself (I'm vegan) but for my friend. He lives in LA (I live on the east coast) and has fallen on hard times. He's going to school and will graduate in December, but was laid off a couple of months ago and will soon be evicted. I don't really have any expendable income at the moment. Maybe some internet kindness can lift his spirits. Thank you. 
0	Have a craving for a sausage and mushroom pizza. Had a long day at work and just want to sit and eat and drink a beer. Hope everyone is having a great night! 
0	I will answer any questions you have.
0	I am a graphic artist (3rd year in college) and I will do a graphic of any kind (logo for your Facebook page, TV show themed graphic, graphic of your favorite thing, repair a picture with Photoshop)  Here are some examples of my work:  [One] (http://imgur.com/lxNCsuS) [Two]  (http://imgur.com/q3PEtwm) [Three](http://imgur.com/VGGzkbE) [Four] (http://imgur.com/ZLfaNi8) [Five] (http://i.imgur.com/5lGYNucs.jpg) [Six] (http://imgur.com/iNbLAMf) [Seven] (http://imgur.com/cdJ4mVe) [Eight] (http://imgur.com/gaKtm1V) [Nine] (http://imgur.com/9KjM4n3)   &lt;3
0	Hi, RAOP. First timer here.  Nothing terribly special... UK dweller (South East Coast represent) who lost my job last August, ekeing out a living for the last 6 months or so on my severance pay but nothing has come up yet.  I've held out for as long as I can without making a claim for any benefits (which I've just started on) and have been living super frugal for the last month or so. 39p pasta sauce and a can of tuna only gets you so far before you want to throw in the towel. Come Monday I can stock up on some more varied food stuffs again (and pick up those Skyrim PS3 DLCs that have been rubbing my nose in my shitty financials) but right now, I'm hankering for some comfort food.  If someone can help me out, I'll be paying this forward at a later, more  financially stable, time.  Peace out, fellow Dovah. Your love is appreciated.
0	Title kind of says it all, I haven't been able to make it to the grocery store in a while and I've been missing work due to illness so I'm a teensy tiny bit hella broke.  I will gladly trade a small custom embroidery for food, and/or pictures of my cat being a cat.
1	If you're willing to get me a large Ultimate Pepperoni Feast and a 2L of Coke from Dominos (I'll pick it up to spare you the delivery charge), I'll give you a shoutout in the next episode of my [YouTube series](http://youtube.com/samuraientertainment) in addition to the usual thanks.
0	As the title says, I recently lost my job do to contract cancellation. I would really appreciate a pepperoni pizza. I will repay the effort once I am back on my feet. I'm a bit hungry filling out all these job applications.
0	Ohhh that tense wait for blood test results, at first 6 months apart.  Brutal.  Even after being declared Cancer free, the nagging worry of a return just festers inside of you.  I finally made it to only having one test a year, and no more nightmarish CAT scans. Today was my first yearly result call.   You expect anything but good new, because you prep yourself for worst thing he could possibly say.  You brace yourself in defense of it, for weeks after they draw the blood from your veins.  It builds and builds up until that call.  And then it comes.  That intolerable small talk when the Doctor first gets on the line.  It's a pleasant exchange, though the entire time, you're mind is screaming "SAY IT, SAY IT DAMN YOU, WHAT DID THE BLOOD LOOK LIKE!?  YOU SAVED MY LIFE BUT I WILL LOSE IT IF WE TALK ABOUT MY COLLEGE OR THE WEATHER FOR ANOTHER MOMENT!".      "No changes, which is a good thing".  Deafening relief.  The world just somehow looks better after this call, it smells better, everything is vivid, clearer, more alive.  Please help me with a celebration meal worthy of this feeling.  My favorite pizza, I do not have the funds for it.  I can think of nothing else right now that I would enoy more than a simple Large Bacon Pineapple Pizza from Dominoes with BBQ sauce instead of marinara.  If it was a wild animal I would hunt it with my instincts and wits alone.  But alas.  If you see fit I thank you for any help you may give.
0	I feel absolutely horrible for asking here in light of the tragedy on the East Coast, but I am at my Wit's end. I've literally just had the tv classic "Well, it can't get any worse..." moment, and then literally within 5 minutes Storm clouds moved in and it started pouring down raining, and I am without shelter.   I was planning on walking downtown to a 24 hour cafe and trying to sort things out there. My only friend in the world is out of town all weekend. A nearby inn is letting me sit in their lobby, for now.   I was also going to stop by a store to grab a bite to eat (food stamps), but that's not possible anymore with this storm. I could really use a warm pick me up reddit. I'm cold, wet, and starving.   I will be glad to answer any questions of how I got into this predicament or provide any proof about my situation if you want, don't want to take up space or time. 
0	Just tried the 50% off any handmade pan pizza one while making an online order and it says it's not valid here. Was really hoping to get a cheap pizza cause even though we can't really afford it at half price, I could swing it. We *definitely* can't afford it at full price though.  Edit: Clarified wording.
1	I've been babysitting my youger siblings a lot recently and let's just say they're tired of Top Ramen. I feel bad for them and mom can't go grocery store just yet. I'm an avid watcher of this subreddit and send thanks to those who are generous to others. I get paid next week and would love to help out someone else who is need of food. I'd be much appriciative and will most definently return the favor. Thank you people of Reddit!
0	No sob story here i'm afraid folks and i'm a guy so no tales of how i'm on my own in bed wearing a tiny pair of pants (does that ever work?) I'm not really expecting anything to be honest  Just got my first car (Peugeot 106 1.1 liter!) which came to £450 and the insurance which came to £1500 for the year, i only passed my test a couple of days ago at the fourth attempt (so hang in there anyone still doing it.. So worth it!) basically i haven't got a penny to my name and i'm suffering a touch of buyers remorse but man i love driving   Hope everyone's having a good day! If anyone's in the UK, did you hear that thunder?! Awesomeeeeee 
0	Hash partay needs pizza what up
0	I just started college this week, it is my first time away from home.  Needless to say that things are not as easy as i thought they would be:(.  I have been bumming off friends for lunch this week. I would like to return a small favor to them after our test Monday. Someone please help me!
0	My girlfriend and I are living in a trailer with my brother while we go to school. If any of you have lived in a trailer, you should know that a little bit of heat goes a long way, especially when there is no AC (which is our case). Turning on the stove or oven raises the temperature to the point where my greatest fear becomes spontaneous combustion. I'd be glad to pay it forward when I can!
0	I'm an employed woman that lives alone, I make enough to take care of myself, but no extras. I am going to visit a friend who is celebrating her youngest's 5th birthday...I bought her a cake, because she spent all of her money on buying him a Yu-Gi-Oh set of cards and toys but I'd really like to show up at the door with dinner for them. I wont be ordering it this very minute, not for a few hours even but there is only a Domino's in our town. Please help and I'll try to send pics! :)  My email address is rainbowsmoothie_elaine@aol.com, I wont be able to check reddit but I should be able to check my email from my cell phone! Hope this works!
0	Just picked up a new job, payday is tomorrow! If someone pizzas me a half off dominos today, I will pizza two people dominos tomorrow. Go!   Located in CT, will pizza two people $20 each, and the half off promo 9143 is in full effect!
0	broke till i get paid next friday would really love some pizza right now
0	So I just lost my fantasy football match this week and that put me out of the playoffs... so now i would love to eat away my sorrows with a pizza.  Please....
1	Title says it. I'm bummed. I'm in the midst of an internship with disney (you would think I'd make money to live on). I had a seizure the other week so I've been out of work for awhile, my roommates have been awful, I've been dealing with security all day and I would love to just relax with a pizza and a movie and chill. I can't afford my own pizza right now. Bummer.   So does someone want to make my night? 
0	Got a few friends coming by tonight to watch the PPV we're all broke as s**t, and would like some pizza to fuel us through the night. (We're in the UK so the PPV is on at like 1am till 4am)
1	Hey guys, so as the title implies I'm a college student attending Florida State University. I'm currently studying in the library and could really use a pizza. Unfortunately I'm also broke until the end of the week. I'm hoping someone generous makes my day!
1	After putting gas in my car, I'm now broke. I ate my last two eggs this morning. Normally my orange tree in the backyard would get me through but I gave my last few oranges to my neighbor.  [Pic of ID](http://i.imgur.com/vlP2G.jpg)  EDIT: Thank you DickBaggins!  [Here's a pic](http://i.imgur.com/bxk6F.jpg).
0	I have no money and i don't work (Still underage) and my parents are on vacation and my brother is out and forgot to leave me money for food. A small box of pizza would be appreciated. Please and thank you kind Reddit community. :)
1	It's a big deal to ask for this, as I'm the first to admit that I am very independent and hate asking for help, but I've got nowhere else to turn.   Story: I'm a freelance theater artist, and I depend upon a steady stream of checks from my various performing and teaching gigs to stay afloat. However, this week two theaters where I teach failed to send my payment, and while I've worked it out to have those missed payments added in a few weeks, I'm currently down to $10 to last me for food for the next two weeks! I am almost out of food at my house, and I've finally accepted that I can't just tough it out with no food for two weeks... so I'm turning to you, the Reddit community, for help!  If you are able to help, I would be extremely grateful! Thank you for reading!   EDIT: I accidentally a sentence. 
0	Hi all. First time requesting here. No sob story, nothing like that. I'm just a hungry college gal in want of pizza. If you take the time to send me one I'd be so grateful!
0	Just finished up my summer finals! I took very difficult classes but I passed thanks to my lovely roommate. She helped me these past 6 weeks but know I want to thank her!! I don't have expendable money since I am a student so I am asking if someone could help me show her that I am thankful! I will try to return the favor as soon as I get a job!
0	Hi guys! As the title reads, don't have any food at the moment, just finished eating all the old bacon for breakfast and my bank account is sitting at 22 cents till tomorrow.  http://imgur.com/JwUFDLc  I'm also playing FFXIV: A Realm Reborn, IGN: Perez Hilton, Server: Cactuar !!  Thanks,  Chris
0	if someone could get us some pizza money that would be the greatest act of kindness in the history of humanity.
0	I don't get paid until Tuesday. I have $3.50 to my name and I need that to get gas to get to work Monday and Tuesday and I'm so hungry. When I get paid, I'll of course bring it back here and pay it forward.  Please help before my stomach eats my kidney!
0	I have just started a great job after being out of work for a month. All of our funds were eaten while I was out of work. Anything would be appreciated we are just hungry and have nothing left. Make sure yall have a great day. I'm in dallas TX. 
0	Me and my 4 yr old daughter are both disabled so money is scarce but the family loves pizza so I'd like to treat them if someone could help out. Thanks
0	Mother out of Tampa Florida with two beautiful girls who I would love to treat to a special pizza dinner this weekend. Can't really afford to do anything extravagant for my daughters so I was looking for help to put a smile on their face with their favorite food.
1	No long sob story here. My 6 year old is begging me for pizza and I don't have the money to get any. So, I thought I might could trade my PS skills for some zza. I can do touch-ups or color a pic for ya. My son and I would really appriciate it. You guys at RAOP rock either way. Much love!
1	Title says it all. Just got out of class and I want nothing more than a pizza while doing homework and studying. I have ten bucks to my name which is going to have to go to gas in order for me to get to and from campus. I do have a gig (freelance video guy, here) next week that I'll more than happily use the cash from to pay it forward.
0	I'm currently unemployed trying to get another job, I have an interview on Monday. Out of money for Pizza luxuries and hungry :( - I don't have a cat..., but I could deliver a pic of some local wildlife? Squirrel? Crow?? Or perhaps a sweet new wallpaper for your desktop from my collection. Any help is much appreciated - Thanks for your time!
0	Hey, my bank account is over-drawn by $127. All I've got in my fridge is a half gallon of milk that expired 3 days ago, 2 bottles of woodchuck that I think are probably older than I am, and a slice of munster cheese. If there's anybody out there that would be in such a giving mood as to donate a pizza so I can have a good meal tonight and tomorrow it would be much appreciated. Merry Christmas to all of you here on RAoP.
1	I present a humble situation where one brave soul could prove their honor.  Unfortuantely, I am getting laid off in 2 days, sucks, I know, but thats not the worst of it.  My girlfriend and I went grocery shopping recently, using the very last of our food stamps. During our trip, we put all our groceries in the car (which we use twice a month to go get groceries, can't afford to drive more than that.) Once we got home we realized after a couple hours that the only item we left in the cart, was our pizza.  I called the store and they said that unless someone brought it in and reported it, we wouldn't be able to get our pizza.  Sadly, nobody reported it.  We really really wanted that pizza! So as I did an inadvertant RAoP, I'm hoping that a generous redditer will bestow upon us a delicious pizza pie!  I have verification code! Want to make our night?
0	62 cents in bank account, awesome, but not complaining. I get paid tomorrow so if anyone can get me some pizza to get me by today, that would be awesome!!
0	Hey guys, I just fasted for 5 days for the Hunger Unity for East Africa fundraiser here http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=224652260904169 if you wanted to check it out.  All i had for the last 5 days is 3 V8's and a Herbal Tea (so i didn't die and kept my strength up)  Now that it's over, i'd love a fresh pizza. If someone would be so kind as to email me a card for pizza (pizza hut, dominoes or something) I'd be ever so grateful! Thanks again! Reddit on!  EDIT: Thanks to HOTMAMMA, I live in the USA, just so you guys know! EDIT: Thanks to SarTim, I pulled my email address, if anyone is kind enough to get me one, post here and i'll PM you my email :)
0	I'm staying with my friend Danielle in Los Angeles (Culver City) who is getting married tomorrow, she's too stressed out to cook and is claiming too stressed out to eat. I've got $22 left to my name til I head back to Canada. Can you help me help her out with pizza?
0	Hi reddit, I am broke and just started work last week. I don't recieve my first paycheck till friday. Any chance I can find some random pizza kindness?
0	I'll keep it simple. I'm broke because of some unfortunate events. I'm working all day in a crappy mall with no food. I would really love a pizza. If I get a pizza today before my shift ends at 9pm EST, I'll buy two different users on RAOP a pizza on Tuesday.   Edit: Tuesday is my pay day. 
0	Its my first time posting on the subreddit so please forgive if anything is done improperly. We're 23 both freelance workers, though we're currently looking for other jobs since there have been less and less gigs as time passes. Moneys been tight. Thought some warm pizza would be a nice pick me up.
0	TBH, I never knew this was here on Reddit, but imho only, that information came at the perfect time.. 2 years and 16 days ago I was hit from behind on my cycle at a Stop Sign. The ER doctor told me that if I had been wearing a helmet, the force of impact was so great, I would have been killed on the spot. (extra weight (avg 4-6 lbs.) of the helmet would have caused my neck to snap and kill me)  Joining Reddit was one of the many things suggest to me, to help re-train my brain and thought process. To everyone I have talked/debated with, let me take a second here and say Thank You.   But back to the reason for the post, may I kindly ask for a pizza? As it has been a long road back to somewhat normal for me and thinking about someone I don't know, caring enough to say, Hey, let's send this guy a pizza just because, well, it is so damn cool. I'm not sure what happens next, but to the person if they decide to say hey I can do that, please know from the bottom of my heart, I am grateful for your kindness and will pay it forward as I get better and hopefully get back to work. James  
1	http://imgur.com/f7baf I've been living off of ramen for the past couple of days now. Im a college student.. 
0	Seriously hungry and hoping for some help. Bank surprised me with an new "maintenence" fee and made me overdraft, won't be corrected till tomorrow. A pizza would be awesome right now, and it sucks since it labor day.
0	Broke. Been broke, I'm with two of my buddies, we all got out of school a few months ago and are stuck in the void of trying to start a career with a mound of student loan debt :( Spent the last 5 dollars on cat food, could someone send us a pizza so we can eat too?
0	Upon inspection there's been money taken from my account. This is not going to plan.
0	Hey, RAoP. I'm a musician looking to have a little fun and get a little more experience with recording. I'm not personally requesting any food, but I'm rather offering my services for those of you out there that want a little more of an incentive to buy someone else a pizza (as if the real life karma isn't enough lol).  So here's the deal: I will write and record you a personalized (to your username) jingle/song (depends on if the creative juices are flowing) if you buy someone else a pizza!  This doesn't have to start and end right now. Let's make it a project! Buy someone requesting a pizza in this thread and I'll write you a song for it! If you want to know my capabilities, check out some of the stuff I've written and recorded at [www.jonmiklues.com](http://jonmiklues.com). If you want a song in a specific genre or style, let me know!  I'm looking forward to the challenge!
1	Currently been living on about 30 dollars for the last week and a half in college, waiting to get my student loan. There's been a strike going on though so I couldn't try to schedule a pickup until this week, and today I learned they still think I'm on my probation from last term (Which I corrected by achieving a high enough GPA and got off probation with the school, but not OSAP).   Anyway, it's going to be a while before I can even pick up that loan but even after all that it will take a little bit before it's deposited to me. A pizza would easily last me a few nights worth of dinner and certainly beat the rice krispies and peanut butter sandwiches I've had for every meal the last week.  Once that loan comes through I'll be sure to pizza it forward if someone comes through for me :)  I'm located in Oakville, Ontario
0	My gas got shut off, I owe a grand to the electric company, I haven't paid my student loan bill in full in months and I have been out of work too long now, even though I have been applying to dozens of jobs a day and am signed up with temping agencies, have a bachelors... I can only afford to eat about once a day now as it is and I can't stop thinking about pizza, which would be a dream at this point.   I am doing everything I can to try to make ends meet, I work for family, friends, temp, hang IT technician fliers around town, but since I lost my job every other opportunity has seemed to dry up in Chicago. I have an interview tomorrow for a paying internship and I would love to be able to walk in there on a full stomach.  Being Chicago, there are hundreds of pizza places and I am not a picky guy but if you were going to buy me a pizza please don't pizza troll me with anchovies :P I like meat and veggies and would be so grateful if someone could help me take my mind of all the shit that's going on in my life right now with a hot dinner.  edited a typo.
1	SO, I lost my job about a month ago, waiting/hoping on unemployment insurance, utilities are slowly being turned off (I currently have no hot water, BBRRRRRRRR), i'm sick of asking friends for money and my mom has helped me more than she is able to.  My dog Odie is also out of food now, today I fed him some leftover eggs and hashbrowns with gravy, he will also be enjoying the pizza and I will post pictures of this.  My request is for www.screaminmimispizza.com specifically, because it's only a couple dollars more than a regular chain pizza and it will feed me for 2-3 days. My favorite is a pizza w/ eggplant or the bbq chicken pizza w/ ricotta.  Thanks for reading, Drew
0	well i decided to ask one of my friends, and he was nice enough to get me pIzza tonight :)  I could still use an E-card though, i ate all of the Domino's artisian with spiniach and feta yumm..  but that or pizza hut one is good for me.   
0	Readers Digest version of today: My biological father (who hasn't been a part of my life) had all of his siblings message me and tell me that *I* was the reason he wasn't involved.  So, I spent a lot of the day crying.  On top of it, my baby has a double ear infection AND hand, foot, and mouth.  AND it's 102 degrees outside. Meaning the oven on would make it worse.  I know tomorrow is a new day, and will be better...but today, I would really like to enjoy a meal I didn't cook myself.  I know I could get dinner from pizza hut for like $15 including tip.  If anyone could help me out, I'd totally pay it forward when I have some extra cash.  If not, thanks for letting me get all that junk off my chest.
0	If you look at my previous post you will be able to see my story, since then things have settled a little, the stress is still high but overall I am looking at things more positive, I would love to be able to get a pizza to relax this weekend without having to worry too much about food.
0	My money should have come in at the beginning of May but it hasn't and cheap as they are, I really can't afford takeaways. I live in England and there are quite a few near me still open (according to Just Eat). If anyone knocking about would be able to help it would be much appreciated, this was done on a whim so no worries if no one can.
1	I'm not the type of person to ask for anything but this past January I lost my job due to going partially blind in my left eye. I have struggled ever since to find any work and have been going from couch to couch. I've been fortunate enough to be able to house sit for a week. Unfortunately the  people im house sitting for have no food here and I'm down to .05 cents to my name. A pizza would really cheer me up right now.
0	so i'm a virginian who got in a car accident 3 days ago around kings street, my family has me in bed for the next 2 days cuz of the stitches on my thighs. anybody wanna prove to my family this subreddit is legit? &lt;3
1	Hello all, I am broke and out of food and decided to try this out. I'm a 24 year old male living in Phoenix. I moved out here in October 2010 to move into a halfway house. I am an addict in recovery, been sober 11 months. In the beginning of December I moved out into my own apartment. One of the complex managers lived in the halfway house with me and was able to get me an apartment and a job painting the complex. So I have been painting to pay for the place. I am trying to food stamps, but my passport (which is required for the process) appears to have been lost in the mail, quite unfortunately. I have been receiving a lot of help from people, but at this time I do not have any food so I figured I would try this out. Thanks for reading.
0	This week has been hell.  I've been depressed lately.  I've barely enough to pay rent this month.  School's just becoming a bit much right now.  We're almost out of groceries here at the apt, too.  I've not eaten much in the last two days.  It's driving me nuts...  I would be so grateful if someone could help out.     
0	I am a postgrad whose adviser just told me my thesis project needs to be completely changed. Could you please send me a pizza to cheer me up?
1	Had my phone stolen off me twice in two months, my insurance excess is pretty **ridiculous** and have had two teeth pulled earlier this year. Money is really tight at the moment (due to insurance and whatnot ) and a pizza would really help alleviate a bit of that and make me feel allot better.  I have been pizza'd before through a private message and have done the same to someone who seemed depressed and jaded in a unrelated subreddit. I now have to change my whole life/routine because of the fear off seeing the same bastards again. They are fairly local and one of them was arrested for the robbery(hence retaliation). Police couldn't give a **single fuck** anymore as they have someone arrested even though there are still 2 others out there and I'm getting threats. [proof of crime][redacted]  **Edit!!** Not Starving!- Can get by without (have *just enough* money to survive), Just want cheer me up pizza, that's all
1	EDIT: I have been offered pizza for my family, THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!  I'm really not sure how to do this, I've been lurking for awhile and signed up last night and my email is verified.  My husband started a new job at the beginning of last month, they pretty much promised the "world" to get him in the door. This hasn't happened, instead it's brought us further to the bottom. We made a whole $500 last month and it's not better this month either. He's talking about getting a lawyer because, he hasn't been paid for everything he's done and paid way less than promised. No, we didn't get anything in writing and that is one piece of evidence we don't have for a lawyer.  I applied for foodstamps on the 23rd of last month. They said they would be expedited but, then said (today on the phone) that since we did have that money last month then they have until after the 20th of this month to finish my case. They said they are unsure of the info on the wage form from his employer. Well, I haven't seen it since they faxed it to eachother and my worker is out until Monday. I spoke to a supervisor and didn't really get any words in.  Anyways, our bills are not all paid so the $212 (Yes, that was his pay deposited in the bank!) today had to go towards the bills. My husband is a truck driver and I'm applying for financial aid to go back to college.  We are a family of 4 and would love to request pizza for tonight. Yes, I know that I am new. I cannot offer contribution of funds, gift cards or whatever but, I can offer things locally and posted an offer of a full garbage bag of clothing/shoes for a little girl in the assistance section. We are behind on our internet/phone so it will be shut off soon, that is why we still have internet access or else I'd have to use the library in town.  I'm unsure of how this works, please bare with me. We are rural, they don't deliver out here. There is a Pizza hut, Dominos and a Hunts brothers in a local country diner.  I want to make sure everyone knows that my kids will NOT starve tonight if they don't get pizza. We have a few odds and ends and I would never, ever let them starve. I'd find a way to get them food before letting that happen. I'll also be visiting the pantry for the 1st time on Tuesday.  I'm not sure what kind of proof I could give? His checks are direct deposited with no stubs mailed yet. Let me know what I need, I can try to figure out something to prove if requred.
1	Zalodad and myself would love to have a pizza with our kids tonight! My husband lost his job, our food stamps haven't come in yet and I don't get paid till next week. Plus we have only a couple of dollars for gas and hardly anything in the pantry. If you could help, we would appreciate it! :) 
0	First time poster here. I get paid tomorrow and would like to treat my family to pizza tonight for being patient.  Things are slim and I think they would really appreciate it...I know I would. Thanks a bunch in advance.   
0	Please help! http://i.imgur.com/k4mZ7kR.png?1
1	My fiance and I are both starting our second year of college, and we got an apartment this year.  Long story short, she's from out of state, so her tuition and class fee's were doubled, and it ate up most of our money.  Add in having to pay out of our pocket to clean our apartment we JUST moved into to make it anywhere near livable, and I'm stuck with $0.57 in my name until my paycheck hits the 21st.   So... If you want to cheer two broke college students on a ramen-diet up, it'd be much appreciated!  EDIT:internet derped, so this didn't show up the first time.  Some1Random has already PMed and offered, so a big cheer to him.  Thank you to others for caring though ^^
0	Lost my last 5 dollars last night and don't get paid until Friday :(  Just had my last cup o noodles and a Pizza would rock and/or roll! Much appreciated!
0	I'm a visiting medical student from Costa Rica.  I got locked out of my apartment in shorts for 3 hours just now. (I was taking out the trash, no roomate home). Had to pay the locksmith and ran out of cash for the weekend.  Could really use some comfort pizza.
1	I've been unemployed going on three months now, and unfortunately my student girlfriend's part time job at the pharmacy doesn't leave much left over for anything but rice. Here's hoping for a hot pizza.
0	I doubt anyone will send. But if you do, I'd be happy to take pics of me enjoying the pizza. I like Italian sausage and bacon.
0	I have a stable job/income but it isn't much and most of my meals consist of 68 cent pot pies.  I would simply like to eat something different for dinner tonight.    Please ignore my request if someone else who can't actually eat posts.
0	I could really go for a ... anything besides ramen right now. I've been extremely frugal and thrifty lately due to budget constraints, and something with lots of carbs and cheese sounds absolutely succulent and delightful. Anybody care to grant mercy on this poor, pizzaless bastard? I promise to pay it forward! Also, I has a verification code.  Also willing to trade drawings (hand or MS paint) or simple/remote IT related tasks. Also has the Photoshop skills.
0	with my best friend and haven't eaten a full meal in a while. looking for a blessing while we try and figure out how we're going to get home. :)
0	I wanted to lean on the community really quick for some pizza tonight.   Lost my bank card on Saturday afternoon and I am really sick of oatmeal and frozen veggies, since that  is the only thing left in the fridge.    I give my word I will pay it forward by the end of this week if not sooner and get some else pizza.  Thanks for reading 
0	Hey guys,  I work part time, go to school, and I support my disabled mom who would be homeless otherwise. I'm dead broke ($0.64 in my bank account, I think) till I get paid on tuesday and there is no food in my fridge/pantry (I bought mom a few days worth of groceries yesterday).  I'd love to have a pizza or two to get me through till tuesday when I get paid. I'll pay it forward in january when things should be looking up for both myself and my mom.  Edit: I didn't post on my regular reddit name because I didn't want it out there on that name I'm having issues. If you want, though, I'll give you that name and send you a PM from it.  Edit: **THANK YOU!!!**  I got a pizza gift card, and that person wishes to remain anonymous. 
1	So I work for state mental health agency, I recently hurt my back breaking up a fight between a few of our kids at work and have been out on workers comp. which has delayed my normal pay so I'm a but broke. My neurosurgeon today told me I'll require surgery to fuse two vertebrae together. Now, I've never had any kind of surgery before, so it's a little daunting to think about. I'm very optimistic about the procedure though, and I feel I lucked up with a very good cutter handling my issue. Pizza would make me feel better though, that comfort food thing we all have at times. Can anyone help a partially broken and broke guy out? 
0	[Imgur album!](http://imgur.com/a/pZ1PB)  I make these in my free time and would love to share them with someone for a pie! I do not use graph paper anymore so there are no noticeable lines, and the best part is that I will literally send these anywhere! I'll even do other characters from other NES games. (No customized ones though, I'm not that good.) Thanks for your help!  *EDIT Forgot to mention that these are cutouts. Hang them in your room if you want!
1	    Pizza: round and hot.     Craving cheese and meat? A lot!     Send one? It's a thought...  EDIT: It all appeared on one line, so I fixed it.
0	I recently lost my job due to cost cutting, and now I have to wait until Tuesday before my first unemployment cheque goes through. Can someone please jsut help me out until Tuesday? I'd really appreciate it and will pay it forward on Wednesday.
0	Pretty much what the title says. Felt a little stress from the weekend (relationship problems), so I decided to unwind a little bit with some weed. Now I'm feeling the munchies and I realize that I've got no food in the house, and I'm not okay to drive to go out and get money or anything. A pizza would be very appreciated. Located on the East Coast of the US, thanks for your time. Any Ents here?
0	I'm whoring my career in the Army i hopes that someone out there will send me some pizza. I'm finally able to get back on a computer after almost a year of traveling and I'm settling in to my new home at Fort Bliss in Texas. I'm new to this area and I'm hungry. Anyone want to help out a soldier?  edit: thing2thatiam is helping me out. Thanks everyone for supporting us.

0	Pre-Law, if I make it through (wouldn't count on it if I were you but there's a chance) you get free law stuff. My ferrari lost its traction control and I lost my dads visa black card so hard to eat.
0	At the start of the month my car broke down. I came back two days later and it was stolen. Cant afford a new one but saving my butt off. Work doesnt pay nearly enough and i have only a couple of pennies to my name till friday but im happy i have a job. Just got off work and only ate a pb j sandwich for lunch and im starving, but sick of living off ramen and pb j for a week. Any offer would be greatly appreciated.
0	Haven't eaten anything since Thursday evening - would be lovely to have something for dinner tonight :).
0	I started my new job on the 30th and we only get paid on the 15th and the last day of the month! I'm out of food and starving! I don't have any food till the 15th. Would like help please! 
0	I am sick today, got the cold. I just can't make it outside today and I have no money.   *Anything will do.*  Thanks.
0	My friend thinks that RAoP is a farce, and either an attempt to gather addresses or send pranks. I just want to show him he's wrong. A large extra cheese/extra sauce pizza might change his tune. Afterwards, I might be able to convince him to pitch in to fulfill someone else's request...  I'm located in the Antelope Valley in California. I intend to provide pictures of said delicious pizza if it arrives.
0	Just found out about this subreddit, and I must say that this is a very honorable thing of redditors to do. Unfortunately for myself, I'm allergic to milk so a random act of pizza would do me no good. But if I were to make a request, a random act of wings would be interesting.
1	**Thank you, lettherebedwight!!  I will upload pics asap  :) **  **Pictures can be found [here](http://caelana.imgur.com/pizza#6ts7M).    thank you again!!**   I have 3 kids (I talk about them a lot here on reddit) who have been asking for pizza for a few days.  It's summer break, they go back to school on the 11th, and have been really good!    Usually pizza night is a couple of five dollar Little Caesar pizzas, but they are wanting the good, greasy stuff that I can't afford.    Anyone want to be a hero and send a couple of Pizza Hut pies this way?  I will post pictures of them enjoying it!    Thanks for reading!  :)
0	I would appreciate some carbs in the form of pizza to stifle my cravings and cramps!
0	I recently lost my girlfriend of 4 years to another man, and got laid off in the same week.  I've been able to scrape by for a few weeks but I'm running out of money. I could just really use a pizza today but i cant afford it. 
0	My fiance Chris and I (Laura) just moved across town to a new apartment. Unfortunately we got screwed over by the moving company (quoted us around $30 for the truck, costed $80 -.-;) and we barely have enough money to get by until pay day (Aug. 1st). I can barely move let alone cook anything and Chris is in worse shape than I am. We would greatly, greatly appreciate even just a single cheap-o cheese pizza so we can eat. Please help. :(
0	Hello. My mom got back from a single hard day (night too I guess) of hard work and I'd really love to surprise her with a pizza.   Please make me dream come true, RAOP! Oh and we're in Toronto, Canada.
0	Basically the copays from seeing multiple doctors (general physician and then a orthopedic) drained my bank account and I dont have any food in the house. I would greatly appreciate a helping hand.
0	So, I'm from NY. I haven't tried the pizza in Hayward yet as I'm a new student. I thought a fun way to break fast would be with pizza, so does anyone feel like helpin'? Earn your sawab today! :D
0	Some stuff came up and we've been eating ramen noodles so long we've run of of things to put in it to taste better.  It'd be a great day to get a pizza.
0	Today my boyfriend and I have been together 7 years. It's been a rough, jobless summer, and although we are both back to work, we don't get paid until thursday. We have no money for food, or to celebrate our anniversary. A pizza would make us so happy!  The only place that has online ordering right now only accepts credit cards, so we know it might be a long shot, but hoping someone would be kind enough to help us out. :)
0	For real. I'm out of food and more than a little hung over and all I have done today is kill a stupid red dragon in Demon's Souls.
1	So ya i posted in that offer thread but too late i guess. More details there..id link but im shit at phone redditing...tldr is unemployed veteran student waiting for va to unfuck themselves and pay me..just had enough for rent but crackhead roommate spent electric bill money on crack so they shut power off yesterday. Been eating potatoes for almost 2 weeks. Would kill a puppy for an mre let alone a hot pizza. If anyone wants to help ill pay it forward when im able.
0	Just lookin for a kind soul to help me out.I jus moved back to florida an I've spent all my money getting a place for me and my daughter and my disabled mother for whom I care for and all my money was spent on moving here we literally have nothin in the cabinets or fridge it would b nice to order them a pizza n soda so at least I know they have food in their belly I don't start work until next week so I hope someone helps..thanks
0	i have to watch my brothers 2 dogs and a lizard and they have plenty of food here but i havent eaten anything aside from popcorn and garlic bread the past 2 days and now im out of those. my brother didnt leave me much. i do get paid at the end of this week though. just sucks being alone. new to reddit and i can say as a person im a giver so when i can i will give back.
0	I've been going through a bit of a rough summer, emotionally. I feel unmotivated and uninspired. To top it off, the other day my parents told me they don't think I'm ever going to make it in college... what a way to bring someone down. We had a huge fight and I'm currently at my boyfriend's house. I haven't had a delicious pizza made to my perfection in a long, long time and I'm desperately searching for something to lift my spirits.  *In return for a pizza, I will photoshop a panda bear with a machine gun wearing a beer hat, and holding a pizza, riding on a tyrannosaurus rex with a huge explosion in the background.*  Thanks! 
1	Just closed on our new house, no food or money until the 1st.  =\  Shit sucks. Wife doesn't know I'm posting this or she would tell me not to.  Cheese or Pepperoni.  Message me for address/phone.  Thank you reddit and RAoP
1	(*throwaway acct*) I never thought I'd get to this point, I am selling my ps3 on craigslist and I just ran out of cereal (I have been living on dry cereal+water for the past week).  I can't eat until I get paid on the 15th, I just eat popcorn at work to fill my stomach.  It's really sad but you have to do what you have to do.  (I could make a large pizza last a week for sure).  When I get paid I WILL pay it forward, I always keep my promises.  I have a verification code and even a link to my craigslist post (still not answered after having posted it before the 1st of May).  I can take a pic of my ridiculously empty fridge/pantry, bank account is pitiful right now.  Can someone help me? Thanks so much!
0	I don't have a canvas long enough to paint a vivid picture of my sob story, so I won't. Instead, I devised a few riddles for you to have fun with. If you enjoy the challenge they present maybe you'll reward me with a gift card for my cleverness? It never hurts to try. So here you go, a few riddles to toy around with while you debate whether or not I deserve a hot meal today.  1.) What's 4 inches long but can house all of your buds?  2.) If I press hard enough I might strike a face that makes me a wealthier man. What am I?  3.) How many links are in the chain when it clinks?  4.) Right now may not seem like spring at all, but I've got rainbows planned for tomorrow, and then all of these will belong to you.  5.) I had a cat I named him Earl. I had a fish I named him Pearl. But what should I name my bird of prey?  I hope you enjoyed my little challenge of wits, I'll post the answers later regardless of whether or not I receive a gift card. So best of luck and see how many you can get right. And if you feel like helping a guy a bit down on his luck eat tonight feel free to message me or post below.   Thanks again and remember, a mind is a terrible thing to waste, but it's even more terrible to waste a mind.
1	~~Reddit has given me a lot lately, and I am very thankful. So if you are going to choose between me and someone that needs it more, go with someone else. I have a 6 person family - me, husband, and kids 10, 5, 4, and turning 2 next month - and with me having to buy the parts for a new computer (I make my living online) and trying to buy xmas presents, we aren't going to be able to eat anything that isn't homemade for awhile. I normally make pizza myself, but we're out of cheese. My 4 year old has asked me every morning for the past 3 days if we can have pizza for dinner...~~  Someone that wishes to remain anonymous sent me some pizza. Thanks so much!!
0	I'm a liberal arts student with zero dollars to my name and getting desperate. I'd be gracious and thankful for a pizza today 
1	Reddit I've been eating linguine (which I don't know when and why I bought) for dinner and lunch for the past 3 days since it's the only thing left in my apartment.  Proof of culinary skills: http://i.imgur.com/50K2L.jpg  I would be delighted if I could taste a pizza or something better tonight, can you please help me? :D  I can PM you the verification code.  Thanks guys!
0	Now I can't say we haven't eaten recently, but  our dinners have not been the best, this week has been filled with oatmeal,  corndogs, hot dogs and bowls of rice. We could really use some flavor this weekend.
1	I will send an offer on friday to return the favor and keep it going.
0	My husband, 10 month old son and I are in the middle of a move. He just got out of the military so we can't leave just yet even though all of our belongings are packed and have been picked up. The only thing we have to eat is ramen and being the moron I am, I packed all of our pots and our microwave...everything required to make ramen edible. Please don't make us eat cold and undercooked ramen tonight. 
1	My husband was recently reassigned to a new unit (he's a soldier) and he wasn't sure if he was going to be able to take time off for our already booked trip to Vegas. We just celebrated our 9yr. anniversary last week, and this was going to be our first vacation together. I know it's frivolous, but he just got word that his leave was approved and I was hoping to celebrate with some sort of dinner out. Our problem is that payday isn't until the first so we're broke. I know that's a really long story for a simple question, but there it is.   Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to read this :)
0	The bank statement is sitting on empty right now and I'm contemplating "borrowing" some rice from work this week. A pizza would be great!  
0	 If anyone would be the savior of our stomachs we would love you forever and we would draw you something on MS Paint &lt;3
0	I won't pretend I would go hungry without this delicious doughy cheesy love, but I do have a story.  I just emptied the little money I had left in my bank account to register for classes at my local community college.  I never finished my degree and left and worked at a big company making good money for a while.  When that came to an end I moved and had no clue what to do.  I have been looking for work for over 2 years now.  I just recently had to move back home, and I am incredibly lucky to have a mother who would even allow such a thing.  She still has two pre-teen children at home, and works incredibly hard.  Hopefully I can be a positive influence to everyone now that I am living with my fam.  I know my little bro is going to love the three drumsets I brought home (he just started learning).  He seems genuinely interested in music, and I know that's one thing I can really help him with.  Even though I didn't work over the past few years, I have had some great experiences that really started to give me direction.  I am lucky enough to be able to live at home now, and go back to school.  My goal is to get back into a University in a years time, study in intnat'l business and economics and live in Europe for a while (I love to be the foreigner and there is so much to see!).  I kinda did everything backwards, but I am actually excited about working towards my goals.  I would love to celebrate this new beginning with some pizza, but the few bucks I have to spend for myself are going towards bills and I want to take my little bro to go see the Hobbit tomorrow when he gets off of school.  Like I said, I wouldn't go hungry, but pizza seems like a good way to celebrate the first step in changing my path.  We all must face the consequences of our actions, and I want my actions to finally start having beneficial consequences.  A part of me is scared that I will just fail the whole college thing again, but I know I more mature now, and can accomplish what I want out of life.  Fear is not an excuse to not try.  Thanks for reading!  I know my story isn't unique, but it is mine nonetheless.  edit:  I guess it would be useful to know I live right near Google HQ in San Fran Bay Area.
0	I heard about this site several months ago on ABC and didn't think much of it. I am completely out of food and money. I have asked friends, family members, and even my church. My friends and family could not help, and my church turned me away. I have never felt so depressed and alone in my entire life. I really just need to talk to someone. 
0	So, here is my story. I am a 19 year old college student that has been trying to get various jobs for 5 years now. My town is at a low point for a while and even getting hired at McDonalds is a competition between young kids and elders. This, however, is beside the point.  I want to surprise my dad with his favorite Large Cheese Pizza from Pizza Hut. I want to do this because he recently quit smoking. This is pretty big as my family as a huge history of addiction. He quit drinking 2 years ago after 3 years of nearly killing himself. He has liver cirrhosis and if he cannot get a transplant within 6 years, he is guaranteed to die. So, I want to reward him for cleaning himself up and being strong for the rest of our family. If someone can help, that would be great. I have seen some awesome things done here, and you are all fantastic.  Thank you
0	Hi, to whomever kind soul might be reading this, I am pleading for someone to help/bring a smile to my family. Yesterday, my mother went to the doctor, and her doctor said she has a possible chance of having ovarian tumor. She does not want us to worry but we all know how scared she is. She is the caretaker of the family, and with money being short right now, I know she is stress about having surgery if she does have the ovarian tumor. I do not have any money since I am going to surprise my mother with the money for her to use whatever little money I have given her for the surgery. I am begging a kind soul to possibly donate an ecard for my family so we can have a family meal as well as to let her know that there are people out there who are supporting her. I know there is alot of fraud on this page, but my story is true. Please help my family thank you. 
0	Hello. A bit about my situation: i lost my job the day after xmas. Contract expired, customer did not renew (they went with another security contractor). My funds have ran out while hunting a new job, at a horrible time of the year to be job hunting. Any assistance would be paid forward asap.   Edit: 8-1-13. 1511  I have a job interview thursday. woot! 
0	Hey everyone, this is my first time asking reddit for a pizza, or anything for that matter. I'm a 2nd year Environmental Science Major at Appalachian state university. I'm asking for a Pizza because I've been living off of Peanutbutter sandwiches for a bit and a cheesy pizza sounds good. I obviously will live without one, just thought I'd give this try because my friends can't buy me a pizza haha.  After reading other posts, I'd prefer someone who is legitimately starving get a pizza instead, I can enjoy my Peanut butter sandwiches a while longer.
1	 i have $1.80 in my checking account and my school won't allow my roommate to use my meal plan to get food for me. unfortunately, i can't seem to get myself out of bed. i'm starving, and previously mentioned roommate likes to come home high and deplete my supply of ramen.  please help? (:
0	College kid in Chattanooga hungry pretty much broke and don't have a car to get somewhere cheap 
1	Nobodys fault but mine, i didnt get my card out of the atm quick enough. ( i dropped my bag and all my stuff fell out ) It was eaten ( by the machine ) and blocked..   we only just got paid and we have no food. I need to wait a few days for the new card to arrive. This is soooo stupid but i feel really bad. Im not the only one who will be hungry becuase of this. Please please.     I know this is a new acc but i am a active redditor of a few years , can pm you if you like. A friend is also a reddior ,has started checking on me and dont want to worry them as i know she cant help.   
0	We're in Washington state. We spent the rest of our money catching up on bills this month. My cousin worked extra hard at his job to make sure we could cover the bills. I'd love to surprise him with a nice hot pizza when he gets home a little after 9. I'm willing to make a deal to hold a contest 8/23/2013 for a pizza giveaway.  Edit: I am willing to set this up for a different day. He still deserves a pizza even if it's not tonight.
1	I know this is a new acct willing to do whatever to prove not a troll. e-mail is irishred1825@hotmail. I have athritis in my spine and neck. my wife works full time and takes online classes in the evening and we take care of a 2 year old. some food besides mac and cheese would be fantastic.
0	First time trying this out. Here goes nothing.  Did my taxes today, and I owe over 2k for last year.  I already work 2 jobs, 70+ hours a week, with student loan bills near 1k a month. No way I could work much more than I do now. Just had to inform my two great friends/roommates that I need to move out of our house and back to my parents' house to save the money up in time. The move would change my 10 minute commute to near an hour, and push me further from my girlfriend.   Shit, could I use a pizza right now.
0	I love pizza, and haven't had it in ages as it's too expensive for me....then I found this site.  I'll be soooo happy to receive one! :)
0	I feel kinda bad for asking on here but what the heck, I really fancy a pizza right now and it'd be great if somebody wouldn't mind getting me one :) I'd be more than happy to repay the favour once I have the funds to do so :L No sob story, just a regular request :)
0	Hi there, wonderful strangers. We've been having a pretty rough time recently and are frighteningly low on food. The wife and I can live of off bread for another night, but I really need to get something substantial into my two girls (2 and 3 years old). I just started a new job at one of the million local call-centers and will be getting my first paycheck this Friday.   I'm hoping someone will be willing to send us some pizza and I will pay it back and/or forward on friday.   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7xXBcq8nto   ^This is my 3-year- showing off that she know's who you're gonna call.  Please help make some magic happen for my family.
1	So the situation is we've been running low on food the last couple of weeks and any cash we've had has been put immediately into the car for gas to get me back and forth to work in KC.  We have been cooking rice and canned things, but have not much left to last us the next few days.  So that my husband and daughter can eat full meals, I've been skipping breakfast and lunch this week and living on hot tea and chewing gum while at work.    It's normally not a big deal, and I can make it through the day fine, but today I'm already super-hungry and it's not even 11 am yet.  I get paid on Friday and will be able to re-stock our pantry then, but I am definitely feeling the empty hole in my tummy today.  I am thinking of going to Jimmy John's and begging for a day-old loaf of bread if they have any.  If anybody could find it in their heart to buy me a pizza today, I would be very happy, and it could last me the next few days of lunch at work until I get my check Friday afternoon.  I will even pay you back via paypal that evening after my check is deposited.  
1	It always hurts me to ask others for help.  I'm at my fathers apartment right now. Today is his first day at a new job, thank the lord! Well, he left today and I don't know what time he will come home. His job is to help people move, so I doubt he'll be home anytime soon. He found this job after months of unemployment, so there's not much in our fridge other than cold franks. A hot pizza would really hit the spot for me right about now. I made this throw-away account because I have friends who frequent Reddit, and I would not want them to see me in despair. Thank you in advance, Reddit.  Tl;dr Dad left for new job. At apartment alone. Nothing in fridge. 
0	I'm studying Wine for Dummies for a new job. I just paid a bunch of money for new glasses so I can actually see where I'm going now but it has left me broke. I haven't started the new job yet since I have to read this whole book before I can start. I would really really appreciate a pizza as some motivation.
1	Hi, RAOP. So, things are bad: I'm waiting on help from my relatives to pay rent (late) and utilities (also late). My girlfriend and I haven't been able to find work and are having a very hard time making ends meet. The power was shut off this morning, and we don't have enough money to get it turned on--or any food that doesn't require cooking.  I'm looking into getting help from relatives sooner rather than later on the power bill, but I don't know exactly when that's going to happen. At this point, I'd judge this request to be more of a need than a want.   Full disclosure: We've gotten pizza through RAOP twice. Once was through a request a few weeks ago, and the other was a totally unsolicited offer after my girlfriend got into a conversation with someone here. Both times we were a bit better off than we are now, but we didn't have much to eat in the house and we couldn't afford the pizza ourselves.   Oh, I should mention--I have a battery backup that's giving us Internet access at the moment. It'll be out of juice sometime today, so we'll either use the last of our batteries to use a nearby wireless network or head to the library.   Thanks for staying with me through this wall of text.   Edit: Girlfriend said I should offer proof as there's been a lot of fake requests and offers here lately. We can give you a picture of the shutoff notice, or something like that. Reply or send a PM.
1	Hello everyone. Recently I have been struggling to get by, I had about £20 to my name. I decided to sell a ton of my stuff on Amazon to raise money for Christmas presents. So I managed to sell £350 worth of stuff (pretty much everything I had of value), but now Amazon says I have to wait til the 29th to cash out. So, I have no stuff, no money to buy Christmas presents, and I've used the £20 I had to my name for postage. My friend told me about this site and how there are some wonderful people out there who will buy pizza for needy people. I have never really thought of myself as needy, but at this time, I am ashamed to say I am. I hardly slept last night as I was so hungry, I have been relying on a packet of lollipops that I bought for 4p, which I actually picked up as I was walking through the town centre - oh the shame! :( I have a very small family, and they all live 2 1/2 hours away on the train, so it looks like I'm stuck til I get paid on the 6th January. If I have any spare money after I get paid, I'll certainly buy another person a pizza.  I am from the UK, but I'm sure if you're not from the UK it would be possible to get a pizza to me. I know this may seem like a lie because I have just registered, but really, I have never been on this site before, and I can provide proof of my bank balance, my packet of lollipops, etc if needed. Hopefully it won't come to that.  I'd like to give my sincere thanks in advance to anyone who comes forward and fulfills my request. 
0	I just finished my first week of treatment in an intensive out-patient program for depression. Due to medical bills and being on leave from work, money is a little tight right now. I'd love a pizza to celebrate being on the road to recovery and finally seeking out the help I've needed.
1	Me and my girlfriend are too broke to afford a pizza and are really craving one. Grilled cheeses aren't really doing it for us.  Will pay it forward as soon as I can.  Thanks.
0	3 bros, 1 chick, and maybe you?  I want Pizza.  Roundtable Pizza   Lan party this bitch.  
0	Anyone feel like donating a pizza to a hungry college student? I'd be very happy to eat today. 
0	Hey guys, my buddy and I have contracted a severe case of cashlessness.  We just paid rent, and will have no money until we recieve our scholarship checks.  We'll make sure to pay it forward!
0	I'm a 20 year old college student who works full time to pay for school, but I don't get paid until tomorrow and am desperately craving some pizza to help study for finals. Living off Ramen Noodles for the past 2 days has been less than kind to my body, and any help would be greatly appreciated. 
0	Going to run out of food before I can get to the food bank.  Can anyone help me out with a 'za?
0	I dont get paid till tommorow and have nothing to eat after I get off work. I promise to pizza it back when I get paid. Thanks in advance!
1	My fiancee has been sick since last night after she got out of work with a fever, chills, and body aches. I have been working all day, and she has been at home in bed and I want to be able to bring home a hot pizza for us to have for dinner when I get out of work.  She takes care of me endlessly, and I want to be able to do something for her, we just don't have any money right now. I know she has been craving hot pockets all day, but we don't have any so I figure if it is possible, this will really help brighten her day.
0	family of four just short on cash til next week and can use some good food anyone want to help us out. dominoes would be fine for us thanks...
1	Long story short;   Stuff happened.  I'm all tapped out, and have no family or friends to ask for help.  Local pantry isn't until first week of June and by then, I'll be back in the way positive again.  Come Friday, I'll have 3 paychecks.  Figure the luck on that.    Please!  Having nothing to eat/drink but water and it sucks.
0	i will write and record a song of any subject matter/style for a pizza pie. the song is yours. :-) starving artist in south georgia  
0	The Detroit Red Wings lost their series with Nashville tonight, and Pittsburgh beat Philly again. This is not a good night. A pizza from a kind Redditor would really help ease the pain. And I WILL pay it forward this summer when I have more money again.
0	In hungry,
0	There's a shitty story behind this but the boyfriend and myself are hungry. Payday is Friday so I'd love to return the favor but for now our tummies are grumbly and we'd love a pizza!
1	Pretty much what's in the title. Help is greatly appreciated.  -Max  **EDIT: Got some groceries, I'm good now. Thanks anyways, guys!**
0	Not sure if this will work, but we're a few film students that are rather hungry. There is no time to gather food, so we hope that a nice donor would be kind enough to send us a pizza. It would make our night so much nicer. 
0	I would love a pizza!
0	my bff showed me reddit and its a really cool site. i just broke up with my fiancee last night cuz he was cheating on me.  i also think i broke 2 of my toes when i got back home last night. they reeeaaally hurt.  im broke until pay day and i'm really down in the dumps with all of this. id love to eat a pizza while i watch with a league of their own tonight.
0	http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPizza/comments/x1c26/request_negative_in_the_bank_and_got_nothin/ Posted here too, Ive been lurking for a bit on Reddit but guess I dont have it down as much as I thought haha. It's such a big place!! 
0	A friend and I are students at Georgia Tech and we have an important Calculus 2 midterm Tuesday that is 45% of our grade and we are afraid to leave my dorm room this weekend because we might get distracted and not have time to memorize convergence tests, taylor series for power series expansions.  We normally wouldn't come to reddit, but we used up all of our dining hall meals that we can portion for the time being.  If anyone could help, I would be beyond appreciative and would try to return the favor when my pay check comes in from my lab work next wednesday.  Willing to verify etc, thanks!
0	And all we have left in the house is ramen noodles. We're really sick of eating them so a pizza would really make our weekend :)!! We'd really appreciate it and pay it forward when we get paid!
0	This is actually the long story short believe it or not, please excuse my terrible grammar its very late, and humans do not have an effective way of communicating how terrible a time my father and I are going through.  I was forced to move in with my father and his second wife, (then my stepmom) I had to withdraw from my college classes mid semester and quit my job. After living with my father who is schizophrenic bi-polar it became clear that he was extremely depressed by his living situation. He was being used by his wife for money, my father is the kind of person that when you ask something of him it is hard/next to impossible for him to say no. My father was paying rent, utilities, and iphones for 5 members of my stepmother's family. This literally used up 100% of my fathers money monthly. He would stay at home and do nothing but surf and web and read books, all the while my stepmother would use her disability money to buy shit we could not afford and routinely overspend and cause us to have overdraft fees that my father had no way to pay for, I've covered for her mistakes countless times, whenever she overspends she sells something of the family's to cover for her mistakes, the last thing she sold was the family kayak which was bought before they were married, all the while she still would use checks that were in her name to buy fancy furniture, and useless junk. To make matters worse, the stepmother has a son who SMOKES coke and w/e else he can get his hands on. This waste of life step brother of mine decided to get his GF pregnant who then popped out twins (they are religious and don't believe in abortion) The drug addict stepbrother is now a father of two kids when he cannot even support himself, he and his GF have been on welfare since the babies were born and neither have gotten a job or even tried to get their GEDs (yes they dropped out of high school) Now the stepmother spends most of her money on supporting the two kids and her fuck up son, she gives him cash to buy pot, cigs (which they smoke in a closed garage with the kids) I witnessed my stepbrother use his food stamps to buy only ice cream instead of getting real food for his kids and himself. At one point my father confided in me that he had considered suicide, this eneraged me and I decided I would do anything in my power to show my father that this leach of a stepmother cared nothing for him and was using him (he was in love with her and was in denial) I ended up getting evidence that my stepmother had pawned my father digital camera when she said that he had probably lost it. My father confronted her about it and she stood fast in her lie, my father then saw the light that this women was indeed using him and cared nothing for her. (in their 4 years of marriage they only had sex once and on their anniversary my father got her flowers, a card and wanted to take her to dinner but, she ended up going to see her fuck up son's kids instead.) The evidence of her using him continued to rise and rise for a few months until my father decided that he was going to tell her that he wanted a divorce. She ended up ripping out our internet and storming off to her mother's while texting my dad that she wanted the divorce too and that we were not to damage any of her property (oh the irony) or that she would make the divorce as hard as possible and take as much as she could. This was about a week ago and we have begun packing our stuff and preparing to move out, she has no intention of helping pay for the cancellation fees for the phones/net/tv ect. Together we have gotten enough money to pay for one more month so that we have time to move out and into my father's parent's house. Current between the two of us we have about 10$ until our next paychecks and have been eating at my father's parents. I have had to witness my father cry and think of ways to comfort him, he knows that this bitch doesn't really care for him and it is for the best that he gets the divorce but its all really overwhelming even for me, I can't imagine what it is like for a person with a disability such as his. I don't even know what to provide for proof but here is a hate email that my stepmother sent my father after he told her he wanted a divorce, its actually comic at some parts and really shows her true colors, some context though, I clean up after myself not my stepbrother and his two kids.  ***YOU chose to allow your son to attack me and NEVER SAID HE WAS TO STOP!!!! A true husband protects his wife from everyone. Instead you sat there only saying I was to calm down. He is a spoiled brat because you never had him in your life. Where was he all those years until HE was going to be on the street. He disrespected your ex who you claim to care so much about. He has anger issues ANGER ISSUES. TEARING DOWN A DOOR God, what would he do to ME, someone he hates, if I didn't stand up to his lies. I fully intend to prove your precious camera, which, btw was purchased in your manic fit. We had all your fancy cameras as well as a perfectly good digital. Now, you make IT and that little devil separate us. I believe in Jesus Christ and AS FOR ME AND MY HOUSE, I WILL SERVE THE LORD. He believes in the internet..... PERIOD. I stopped feeling safe in my home when he attacked me the first time. He climbs on your lap makes me sick that you cannot see his making fun of you when he shakes your belly. He is a sick puppy. Everyone who has seen the ghostly boy says he is way strange the way he stays in his room all the time.  I told you the sex was what I got hurt doing. I never spoke up as to why, but when you dropped the dream of the surgery I knew you wanted to be diabetic and heavy all your life. I lost respect for you because even your family was encouraging you. For all I know anyway, maybe they weren't and you hid it from me. All I know is you don't ever want to go do anything and I am a very active person when I am having a good day from absence of pain. At least I see people when I go shopping and I recycle instead of buying expensive items we cannot pay for.  I have tried hard to keep a nice home for you and you have to be reminded to CLEAN CAT LITTER AND FEED. I can't do it all without feeling USED!  I raised my kids to help out...what happened to your Ryan, he is above lifting a finger. Does he even know how to clean his own (mostly his) bathroom. Cleaners are right on shelf and I have pretty towels that makes it nice and he chooses to disrespect and not use his towels instead. What disrespect.  I am not a happy person now or before I left there.  I hope you are happy that you allow your baby boy to separate us. YOU DID THIS.  My son WILL BE HELPING ME MOVE SO MAKE RYAN GO TO HIS MIKEY'S HOUSE WHEN WE ARE MOVING. My Son is angry for what unhappiness his Mother is under because of little boy Satan. Dustin told me two months ago that Ryan is pushing us to divorce. Pretty smart boy who adores his Mom. Dustin and Roy protect Me like you will not. ***  I have no idea if anyone will even read all this as it is 2 am and I did a horrible job of explaining our situation but if anyone would like clarification you can add me on skype rcroslin@live.com 
0	Fufilled. Thanks for reading.  Hi there. I'm a 22 year old male who has recently moved. Since moving, I've lost a friend, been mugged at gunpoint, had to replace an alternator, and now I have to replace the struts my car. In fact, it should have been finished a week ago but due to some reasons I'm unaware of it seems that the mechanic I hired has cancelled on me three times and wont even answer the phone at this point. He even has the parts that I paid for sitting on his property. I simply don't have the know how to do so, or I'd do it myself.  As far as losing a friend goes, someone had a change in plans regarding my living situation. I was to stay with her for a few weeks while I found another place. She told me to find a new place pretty much immediately and that I was acting like a child, ect. I wasn't even there half of the time, so I honestly do not know why she went so crazy. It kind of hurt to see her suddenly change like that, since we were friends for so long.  In any case, it's getting pretty rough here lately. I can't leave this end of town for any reason due to my car problems so grocery runs are limited, too. I'm lucky enough to work really close to where I live, so there is limited strain on the car in its [current state](http://i.imgur.com/Z5sdP.jpg). (The strut has recently fallen completely off.) I simply request a pizza. Thanks for reading. I appreciate anything you can offer.
0	I am currently going to college and had to spend the remainder of my money on a class recently.  I promise to pay it forward as soon as possible 
1	I've been living off peanut butter and milk the past couple of days waiting for my student loans to disburse. The idea of a pizza, man, can't even describe how nice that would be.
0	edit: my*
0	Looking for a pizza for dinner/lunch today and tomorrow for myself and my 1.5 year old son.  He loves Stuffed crust cheese and wedge fries from  pizza hut!  Can verify anything!  Thanks!
0	Hey chaps,  I've been having a difficult time recently with my layoff, and it's honestly been a while since I've been able to get take out. So, any fine chaps and lasses want to help a fellow Redditor out? I'll compensate once I get my tax refund back in the future if that's incentive too :)  Cheers!
0	Basically just heard about this sub from a friend and the idea kinda blew my mind. "Who the hell gives out free pizza to complete strangers?" might have been my exact response.  There is literally nothing wrong with me or my living conditions except my roommate wanted to keep his TV on all of last night at what I can only assume was max volume. After like 30 minutes of trying to sleep, I got up to turn it off and he was already asleep. I gave him a look that said, "Really, bro?" but he obviously didn't pick up on it. He then woke up again at some point, turned it on again and promptly went back to sleep. I slept in for my first class. But he's a really nice guy otherwise, probably.  So yeah, I'm here in Buffalo, NY and there is literally nothing wrong with my life except that I'm in Buffalo, NY. But I would definitely appreciate a random pizza nonetheless. 
0	Hey all. Long story short my girlfriend recently had to move from home to Montreal, QC for work. She was told that she would be taxed in Ontario, but it turns out she is being taxed in Quebec. **That is a huge difference.** Her budget is shot and she really has no money left for food.   I will help her out a little bit but i am unemployed and living in Ontario still. Please Help me cheer my girlfirend up! I can honestly say i will make an effort to pay this forward.
1	Held a contest for a pizza/gift card  http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/13mkvq/offer_make_me_laugh_get_pizza/  BestDLine won and he wanted a Dominoes so I have gone to buy him a gift card but the website (after putting in my details) rejects my card and says "We currently only support U.S. customers."  Anyway round this? Or advice on what to do  Thanks
0	As lovely as cheesy pasta is, it gets a bit boring after a while! I'm heading back to work over summer in a few weeks, so I can pay it forward when I get my first paycheck through :)
0	Would really enjoy some pizza just not in the budget. Thank you
0	Apparently central heat is expensive, and I learned the hard way when the MLGW bill emptied my checkings account. I have one meal's worth of ramen left, and I could use a pizza to get me through tomorrow and the day after. I've already notified my parents of the situation, but they live overseas so the remittance will take a few business days.  I live in Memphis, TN.  I will gladly pay you back, or return the favor to someone else in need if you prefer,  by next week when I have some more money :)
1	My boyfriend and I are in a bad spot right now, and it's been a really long, hungry week. The majority of our situation is detailed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/lvgsj/request_please_help_us_keep_a_roof_over_our_heads/). Basically, we're both out of work right now, and life just kinda sucks. We've both had to drop out for the semester, missed too many classes due to not having enough gas. We're looking for full-time work, but so far the 6 temp agencies we both signed up for haven't called.   One redditor was willing to donate a very generous $150, but it won't be transfered to my bank via Paypal until Friday or Monday. Our pets have food for the moment, but their humans are very hungry! Our cabinets/fridge are basically bare, other than spices and seasoning. We used up the last of our leftovers yesterday, and now we're down to bread, peanut butter, and water. And we've had a LOT of peanut butter, bread, and water lately. I hate to ask, but we literally don't even have a dollar until that money shows up.  If anyone wanted to send us a pizza or two, that'd be amazing. Signed up for a verification code just in case ;). We'd be more than willing to send you pizza(s) back when our transfer goes through, pay it forward to some other person here in need, or provide any variety of services as part of the agreement. Also, FWIW, we're in Bonner Springs, Kansas. Have Pizza Hut within delivery distance, and Dominos/Papa Johns within pick-up distance.  Please?
1	Recently I lost my job, so money has been a bit tight. The other day, my crappy car overheated and blew my gasket. So yesterday I had to put all my money towards a new car, and now I'm too poor for food really. I know this is my first post here, but it's worth a shot haha.
0	hey reddit were just hanging out and broke as fuck and hungie as hell. our dog is sick after eating the roast we've been cooking all tonight. if anyone can help us out it would be greatly appreciated!
0	Only thing that's left in the house is a few packs of ramen and other little things, but a pizza would really be amazing. We have a full house here as well, so it would really be helpful. Thank you!   Sadly there's no big pizza chains around, so we only have a local place called Pizza Plus.    Edit: I'm unsure if you can use Paypal online, but you can use a card over the phone, if that helps.
1	I have a job interview today, but I won't have any money until Sunday or Monday. Any kind of pizza would be nice, I could definitely make that last me two or three days. I can pm proof of my balance for both cards if needed.
1	I really want to try this. I'll order a pizza and surprise my Mom when she gets home. If this works i'm gonna give back when I get cash!  Genral Location is Idaho. Thanks Reddit
0	Hi thanks for reading our post.  We are a "combined" family of 6 in Hemet.  My husband has 3 children ages 15, 11, and 8. I have my 14 year old son.  We are raising the 4 of them without any help (physical, mental or financial) from the other parents.  We have had to close down our Small Business this year due to the economy and for the first time have had to go on public assistance.  We are struggling to find gainful employment for my husband, but so far have had no luck.  I would be willing to go back to work immediately, however I will be having lung surgery in the near future to find out if I have cancer.  It seems like with the summer here we should be having some kind of fun with our kiddos, but we are not able to afford to take them anywhere so we have made "movie" night and "game" night at home......a pizza would make it a wonderful night....a much needed wonderful night.  Thank you for reading.
0	hey, im a engineering major (recently changed from cultural studies) and am visiting my grandparents in florida. Im not exactly broke but I need the rest of my money to travel back to college, and I want the pizza to be a surprise for my grandparents to show my gratitude for their contribution to my tuition. I have a verification code, and although Im a new account, will do anything to verify my need.  thanks, charliej
1	I don't get paid until next week, and there's nothing but cereal and eggs left in the house. Not really in the mood for either of those for dinner, so a pizza would really be appreciated, thanks!
0	Finally, Today after about 6 months, our foster children are here! We are so excited. We now have 4 children ( 3 foster and 1 Biological) After spending time with them, clothes shopping and etc, We are totally beat. Get this THEY HAVE NEVER had pizza! We'd like to treat the whole family for pizza, but from shopping , we're all monied out! Until our next paycheck. If anyone wants to share this moment with us, it would be awesome and we will TOTALLY return the favor as SOON as we can.! I see that people offer pictures. We will send some of our FOUR children ( it makes me so happy to say that) Enjoying that yummy pizza. We are located in Midwest City, Ok and have a papa johns right down the street.! Pepperoni is always a favorite. We have 4 kids, plus me and my husband! Like I said we will return the favor, we are just so happy for our blessings and shocked they have never had an american favorite :) 
1	Hi all.  It's my first time posting here, though I've been a redditor for a few years now.  I wanted to make sure that I didn't post here until I absolutely needed it.  I've been broke all summer.  I've been looking for a job, but so far I've found nothing.  In two weeks my financial aid will come in.  I have an amazing job lined up for fall and winter.  But right now I could really do with some real food.  It's been over a month since I've known where my next meal will come from.  Thank you, good people of Random Acts of Pizza, for truly understanding the value of community :)  Edit:  Wow!  Thank you!  Logicday not only bought me pizza for the night, but also a $100 giftcard at Target so I can support myself these next two weeks.  There are no words.  I am truly grateful.
1	I spent a few years in the military, now I'm back in school and using grants to pay for everything.  My application for the IVG (Illinois Veteran's Grant) wasn't processed properly and I need to send it back in with my dd-214 (military service record).  In lieu of the grant paying my tuition for this semester I had to take a heavy chunk of money out of my checking to pay for this semester until that finally gets processed/approved to update my account at the university.  I have about 4$ till the 1st and I'm trying to stretch every bit of rice and lentils I have left in the pantry.  I would greatly appreciate a pizza this evening, thank you for your consideration!
1	so, yeah. im prayin someone finds it and gets a hold of me, til then, its just a waiting game i guess. im pretty pissed at myself. i have no cash whatsoever until thursday, i was supposed to go shopping tonight but that obviously isnt happening. we're basically out of food, my mother is bringin over some groceries tomorrow to hold us over for the week. can anyone help out for tonight? its for me and my 2 daughters. more than happy to take it as a loan and pay it back thursday. youd really be helping a ton. need verification/proof? ask away, many thanks
0	My boyfriend recently crashed his car and its going to cost $500 to fix it. We also have to buy new tires which will be another $500. I'd be grateful for anything you guys can offer and I promise to pay it forward as soon as I can.
0	After filling my car up with outrageous gas prices I'm not going to be able to get any food and do not have any in my dorm. I'm starving and would like to eat today and I would be very grateful for a nice pie.
0	After being laid off from a seven year stint, i have been burning threw my savings to pay the bills and keep my belly full. Unemployment barely covers my mortgage and the SNAP program here in florida only gives me $16 a month for food. A Cheese pizza would go a long way today.
0	Stuck at UMW where we're currently on lockdown because of Irene, and Irene isn't even all that awful here! I've been listening to my roommate sing showtunes for the past four hours. Life is HARD.
1	I live in Baltimore, Maryland very close to a Papa Johns Pizza place. I've been unemployed for over 2 years, struggling to make ends meet. I am loaded with $10,000+ medical bills which I cannot pay because I don't have a job (been struggling trying to find a job, the job environment is pretty crappy here in Baltimore) and many have already been submitted to collections. I've fallen on pretty hard times and I'm hoping there's at least one Redditor on here who is generous enough to give me a Papa Johns eGift Card from here: http://www.papajohns.com/papacard/ so I can have something to eat for today.
1	Hey reddit, im basically feeling like crap right now. I have a history of falling for the wrong girls but this one really hurt. I took my girl  (soon to be ex I guess) to the movies and dropped her off since she said she had to be home early. After dropping her off I realized I had to go back and give her this small gift I had gotten her that I had forgotten about. That's when I found her getting in a car and when I got closer I saw her kissing some guy that wasn't really my friend but I did know him through mutual friends. I dont know what to do, im just gunna drink a bit (not an alcoholic or anything) but I need to relax, I wasnt really in love with her but I was getting there and im just bummed out, I actually spent all my money on the movies I took her to today, and now just starving, depressed, drinking and craving a damn pizza. That would be awesome, not really expecting a pizza but that would be awesome, just had to rant a bit sorry guys.  
1	[Sadness](http://i.imgur.com/EBDoI.png)  I'd appreciate any help. I'm a hungry college and I don't start my new job until tomorrow. If I have to eat one more can of tuna I might die.
0	Recently laid off and up on Capitol Hill, have my dog keeping me company for these very depressing last few days. Made a big pot of spaghetti four days ago that I have been reheating to eat for breakfast lunch and dinner while I wait for unemployment to kick in and pizza would be a nice change, I will return the favor once I am on my feet again in a few weeks, there is a Pizza Hut nearby. Anything helps :)
0	So I'm new to this but I figured whats the worst that could happen... I just recently got an apartment with my boyfriend and we use all of our money on our rent... I'm extremely hungry and am getting tired of bacon and tater tots... plus the supply is running low... If some would be generous enough to help me out I would be extremely grateful. :)
1	My roommate and I are moving in the next couple of weeks and we both are pretty much out of money due to rent, utilities, and such. We're planning on having a game night tonight and would love if some kind redditor would be willing to donate a pizza to help us game into the night and forget about our money problems.
0	As of last month we went from having three jobs between us to just one. But between my remaining job and her unemployment checks we're not doing too bad considering, but having just payed the rent on the 3rd, we're completely tapped out. Her check should come tomorrow and I'll get paid on Friday, but we need to eat today. Would any random stranger be willing to help us out? I don't want to be a charity case so, I'd even be willing to pay you back when we get our money or pizza it forward. Thanks for reading!  **UPDATE**: SpeakerCity was kind enough to help a brother out! My pizza is already on the way. Thank you for offering, Lakerz4life and IrritableOwlSyndrome, too.

1	So a fellow redditor kept me company last night when I was stricken with stress induced insomnia. I never made it to sleep and had to be at work at 7:30. Spent 2 hours this afternoon in the Department of Social Services office trying to see if I qualified for any assistance. Tomorrow I will go on the 30 day processing list for SNAP, they accepted a medicaid application for me and my daughter, and put me on the 2 year waiting list for daycare assistance. I picked her up from daycare and brought her home to give her a bath and as we were filling up the tub I noticed it looked dirty. Then it looked really dirty and red. I stopped the water and got her out of the tub and checked all of our faucets. All had icky brownish red water coming out of them. Needless to say, I'm not cooking tonight and am waiting for the utility company to call me back. Would anyone like to send a pizza to Wilmington, NC to cheer up my 4 year old who thought she took a bath in blood?  Edit: Picture of gratitude http://i.imgur.com/D0gt4.jpg
1	There's too much month at the end of my money and I've gotta pull an all nighter to catch up a bit in my classes, can somebody help me out?  Edit: Seems its already the next day, but I'll keep this request up as I have $0.97 until the first and I'm ready to puke up ramen. 
1	title says it all. was 2 weeks late on rent so i had to pay my landlord off Monday when he came back into town. he worked with me on the payment thank god. i get paid every two weeks, my next check comes on friday afternoon (the 25th) i would absolutely pay it back or pay it forward, your choice. pizza would last me until saturday evening since i work during the days. it would help so much, and truly be appreciated. i have never received a pizza here before

0	Hey redditors, I'm a starving artist and shooting a short film on Sunday, February 3rd with a bunch of other local starving artists.  There will be about 20 hungry people in a cold and drafty warehouse building in Bristol, PA.  We've got a thank you or provided by credit available to anyone willing to share a slice.  Thanks!
0	UK. Just had a conversation with my introvert wife to set up which evenings she can be alone because she started a job with an open office plan and she has to be social all day. Turns out she needs more nights alone than she wants with me. I'm suppose to leave her alone MWF nights and either Saturday or Sunday until 1pm. And now I am extremely sad, want to eat my feelings, and I don't want to ask her for money to do so. Anyone up for enabling me tonight? 
0	Hey Reddit, We're 3 brothers currently freelancing in web design/development and as for now don't have a penny to our name, in fact, quite the opposite of negative pennies. We'll be willing to do web development, illustration or graphic work of your choosing for pizza or we can come up with something for you. FYI we're located in the UK Cheers  EDIT: the offer is still open as mr-smor was unable to order online for us due to geographical location and no stores accepting paypal.  Thanks again mr-smor.
0	Those men and women putting forth their time and effort running against Representative Todd Akin would greatly appreciate some pizza.

0	Hello there! I believe in keeping things simple and to the point to display the best of honesty so here it goes...I'm broke! Literally, I have 58 cents, which i will be using tomorrow to purchase a blue book for my final. I could use a meal for my empty stomach. Let me know if ya can help a student out. Peace!

0	My girlfriends car broke down on the side of the road last night, and she spent the last of our money getting it towed 60 miles back home (Bellingham, WA.). This expense means she will now be unable to pay utilities or the car payment this month. The only reason she was down there was because we were not getting along, which was mostly my fault. I have no money but would like to give her a pick me up. Some za would probably do the trick. Any help would be appreciated.
0	I'm a hungry, poor, pre-medical student. Feed me. Please. I'm in Raleigh, North Carolina. I highly appreciate it! Really! (Orange is the New Black+Pizza would really make my busy, busy night.)
1	Hello! It's been a hard 2 months with money and I listed some goodies on craigslist so I could make some food money for my family and the people never showed up =(  The cupboards are empty, no bread or P&amp;J. Is there anyone that wouldn't mind helping me out tonight? My family would appreciate it so very much. Thank you for your time in reading our plea.   Edit: Tarn33 Came to are rescue and soon my family will be enjoying some much needed pizza!
0	Me and my daughter are wanting pizza for dinner and I am low on cash tonight and hate to have to tell her no.Could someone help us out with pizza and I will return the favor please. thanks
1	My job barely pays the bills, my food budget for the week is spent, and she's been putting extra hours in at her new retail job... so she can buy/ship all 5 of her sisters(plus parents, grandparents, ect) Christmas gifts this year since we live in a different state and won't be able to get together like they do every year.  Even if it's just a simple $5 Little Caesar's it would make her day to be able to be able to 'eat out' instead of the same meals I cook(she works  evenings) day in and out :P
0	Been unemployed for the last few months, but I got a new job a week and a half ago! Only problem is, my supply has run dry and I'm not getting paid until the 12th.   I would be eternally grateful to anyone who can help me out
0	My best friend's not eaten all day or yesterday and is feeling sick. I've got no money, or I'd help him, and he's across the country with no way of getting anything to eat. I'm really worried about him because this happens frequently, and he gets sick because of it. If someone could get him a gift card, I would be eternally grateful. I can draw you a picture of Pinkie Pie, because that's the only thing I can draw. He's in California in the Orange County area  EDIT - Thank you, anonymous gifter! 
0	Payday is on Friday but until then we could use a random act of zza. The fridge is looking a little barren... (please excuse my kitchen floor, it needs to be replaced badly) http://i.imgur.com/Q4iAJ.jpg
0	My boyfriend and I have been unemployed 7 months and 3 months, respectively. We aren't starving but we don't really want to eat beans for dinner tonight. It would be a huge treat to have a tasty pizza instead. We would really, really appreciate it.
0	Anybody in the Belmont/Rockford, Michigan area able to send a pizza to an employee of mine? We have been really slow at work and he's a technician of ours and works as a contractor. We haven't been able to give him any jobs because we've been so miserably slow so we can't afford to pay him. His son's birthday was yesterday and he was going to get his son from his ex-wife today and hang out with him for the day. We were supposed to be able to pay him today but the funds didn't come through from DISH Network (we install DISH) and we won't have money for him until Tuesday. Was wondering if anyone would want to send a pizza his way? Just thought I'd try.
0	Hey RaoP, first time posting here, but I've seen this and other "Random Acts of ..." threads before. As the title says, I'm a down-on-his-luck post-graduate living paycheck-to-paycheck, and these past few days have been hard on me. I can't really afford groceries until my next paycheck, walk seven miles a day to/from work (cumulative, not each way), can't afford lunch so I don't break for it, and I would really just love to sit down after a long day and stuff my face with some hot, cheesy, saucy goodness (also, I'd get to have the leftovers for lunch!). Anyway, if a kind redditor can help out I would greatly appreciate it, and if not, that's perfectly fine too. 
0	My parents are gone for the night and I don't want to cook. Can someone please hook me up? A gift card would be preferable!
0	Fellow Floridian Redditors,  I'm coming to you all with my hat in hand, looking for a bit of help.  I'm way down on my luck, hoping to catch a break for once.  I've been working construction in the hot Florida heat for the past 4 months, and have made a total of $958, before taxes.  I've been forced to move back in with my parents, something I swore I'd never do.  I'm sad, depressed, sunburned as hell, tired and praying for some generosity.  If anyone out there has it in their heart to help out a guy who has been busting his butt to make ends meat, I'd truly appreciate it.
1	Feeling pretty sorry for myself, and my face is all bleedy. Pizza would be lovley.
1	I am having crazy pizza pangs right now. However, between me and getting pizza are some annoying circumstances! I am not picky about what kind of pizza. So if anyone could please help me fill this crazy craving my belly is torturing me with, I'll forever be grateful, and I will be sure to pay it forward as soon as I'm able!   Edit: It looks like I have won a contest for a $10 pizza gift card!!   Thank you /u/CH31415 for the _$20_ Papa John's gift card! You are awesome!! 
1	i just lost my job tonight due to not having a completely open flexibility because im taking 18 credit hours this summer. only reason im even doing that is to meet my goal of getting my AA in less than a year after graduating highschool. im really hungry and have no money. studying for exams, and depressed. please send me a pizza to make me happy and when i get some money i'll paint you something and send it back as a thanks. &lt;3  [edit] got my pizza thanks to kmlweather &lt;3
1	My parents are on vacation and my sister left for the day, but forgot to leave some money for me to order a pizza or something like that. I'm too young to drive, (Maryland driving laws are blah) I was able to get enough change in quarters to make some sort of tip, but no where near enough to pay for a pizza. I have no cooking ability whatsoever, and a pizza sounds amazing.  However, although I don't have a credit card, I do have a saved one on steam, so I will trade any steam game(s) from $1-$15 (with some flexibility) 
0	Earlier this week, someone managed to get hold of my debit card information and went on a pizza purchasing spree in Malaysia. It will be a few more days before my bank credits the money back into my account and all this stress has made me quite hungry.  Once I get the money back, I will gladly pay it forward!
1	Hi guys. Husband with lovely (and of course very nice) Canadian wife here. Lost my job recently and having trouble making ends meet with all of our funds tied up in lawyer and Federal fees for my wife's US citizenship. While I've been blessed with a loving wife and our loyal and hilarious pups, I cannot afford to provide them with anything special during this rough time - even after a humble holiday and stringent budgeting for groceries and supplies from the likes of Aldi and Dollar General.   Truthfully, I'm ashamed to admit that I've failed so completely in being a good provider for my tiny family and I'm glad we decided to wait on having kids so they don't have to struggle with us. But I also have no illusions about this and I'm well-aware that the responsibility lies squarely in my hands. That said, I know how effective something as simple as a pizza would be in raising the spirits around here so I'm sucking it up and asking for help from a community I've valued for quite some time now.  My wife is vegetarian, so I would request a cheese pizza. My local Dominos is the cheapest I know of and has a coupon for an extra large 1-topping for $9.99 ($13.26 w/tax), which is actually better than the regular price of a large ($14.37 w/tax). There are various other coupons as well, from Dominos Store #2878.  Bonus: my wife would be more than happy to draw the subject of your choice in MSPaint!  **TL;DR**: currently failing at providing for family, humble request for a bit of cheesy sunshine through the clouds, MSPaint bounty offered.  No matter what happens or doesn't happen as a result of this request, I just want to express sincere thanks to everyone in this subreddit. The fact that this even exists is yet another testament to all of the good in this world and I can't wait to pay it forward!
0	Hey all, I'm paying for my own college and trying to keep costs as low as possible. Therefore, there is no room in my budget for pizza, but I am seriously Jonesing a pepperoni pizza right now. If you can help me out, PM me and we'll get something sorted out. Thanks for looking!
0	Hey, I haven't had a real meal in a week. I was unjustly fired from my job and am awaiting an appeal over unemployment. Meanwhile, I'm looking for work and school just restarted. Finding work around my classes hasn't been easy. Most are waiter jobs and all want to speak with my previous employer. Its a rainy Sunday here in the DC area and a good meal would do a lot for raising my spirits. Thanks.
0	I had a room to myself, but now I have a roommate. I just really want some pizza to break the ice.
1	I saw a link to this subreddit on the front page, WTF; is my reaction after reading what its about..   I couldn't believe it.  I haven't entirely looked through other requests as I'm pretty sure I'm not the only hungry person in the world, but tbh after I read the sidebar I immediately grabbed my camera and made a "REQUEST" because I'm hungry.  The embarrassing part is asking for food on the internet- forget that,    images of refrigerator that is dieing on me [\[1\]](http://i.imgur.com/IIIYS.jpg) - [\[2\]](http://i.imgur.com/5tNMf.jpg) - [\[3\]](http://i.imgur.com/4Ap54.jpg)  [1] Food going bad, fridge practically empty   [2] Ice-cream I bought gone bad, this is after I knew my refrigerator started trolling   [3] I'm not starving I have lots of bread, but as you can see I can't stand it, at least for today.    I give my praise to anyone that fulfills my request.    When I get the money I'm seriously giving back a redditor a free pizza.    Located in GA  **update:** being able to get free pizza from a fellow redditor I don't even know is unreal   I feel terribly bad, I just found out about this sub-reddit and within 3 hours a redditor gives me a pizza   I feel as if I'm cutting in line, however I'm grateful and I thank you.    Don't forget someone will get a pizza from me.  **update 2:** I've done myself a good [deed](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/jcpic/offer_10_dominos_gift_card_me_giving_back/), but I can tell you this isn't the end. 
0	Hey Reddit, me and my mate here are hungry as ever and my birthday is today. My mate would buy me Pizza but he doesn't get paid till next week. Will pay you back. Thanks for reading guys :)
1	Need some help to get to payday. Almost completely out of food. mac and cheese, rice, and bread is what is left. I live with my three brothers and my father. My father will get paid Friday and and we are eating at a family's house tomorrow. My brothers have full paid week lunch cards for school.  I have gotten a pizza before like 6 months ago and it really helped us out. Just need a little help to get us to payday. Thanks
0	Hey RAoP. I've been pretty down lately, some dark thoughts been going through my head, I think a big part of that is my uncle (whom I live with) is suspected of having Bladder Cancer. I can't describe to you or put into context how unfortunate this is for our family, I mean cancer is usually horrible but on top of the hardship our family is facing this is absolutely devastating. My uncle, my mother, and me are supported by my grandmother. We all live in the same fairly small house, I'm the only one who has a (low wage retail) job and I'm working there and going to school so that soon I can get out of here alive, things are so stressful here. I usually wake up to people arguing and yelling at each other, my car needs a new transmission, I need tons of dental work, I really don't feel like going on a lot of the time but I stay positive and just try to reflect on the fact that I am working and making good grades.  So, I hope that didn't bore you, I didn't get too detailed. As for a pizza, if someone feels like getting me one that would be cool as I am broke until Friday, and we don't have much food here, also we have roaches so a lot of the food is contaminated. Ugh. A pepperoni + bell pepper pie from someone would really give me a little hope.  Thanks for reading...
0	My boyfriend and I are moving to a new neighborhood and this is our last night in our current house. We've got almost everything moved, and are consequently very broke and have been munching on Triscuits, as we aren't able to go food shopping until Friday. A large pizza would set us up for today and tomorrow!  We were thinking about what to do for our tummies and I remembered: Random Acts of Pizza! I've never done this before so I'm pretty excited. PM me for more info. I will send you a picture of us with the pizza and one of our cat Sid the Squid doing something *very* silly. One does not regret pictures of Sid the Squid.
0	Hi there Random Acts of Pizza!  So title pretty much says it. I'm broke, had a pretty terrible week, and am stuck at home hungry with nothing to do. I can go into details if you want but I don't want to post a sob story.  I DO however, have lots of scrap fabric, buttons, and time. And I'll totally make you a loveable, ugly plushy monster and ship it to you next week when I get paid if you buy me a pizza from the local pizza hut [like $15?]. I'd really appreciate it, and so would my stomach. Thanks!  Edit: Oh, yeah, I'm in Illinois.  :]   Edit 2: Well that was fast! I'll post pics of the ugly plushy before I mail it! Thanks to user Olivertw1st! :D
0	College student that just paid three bills and waiting until next Friday to get paid. Your help would really be appreciated.
1	...and all I have to eat here is banana bread, which I've been eating constantly and I'm sick of, and 3 corn dogs, which I'm saving for lunch at work tomorrow.  If someone answers my plea (and I do see there are more...pressing requests than mine open right now), I will look through your posting/commenting history and write a haiku about you based on it.  How can you beat that?  Answer: You can't.  Have verification code.
0	We've just moved into our new house for our second year of uni and we have NO money until our loan comes through in October! Please help us all we have in the house is bread!
0	I'm a single guy in my mid 20's living in California and I lost my job back in May. Two weeks after I lost my job I was diagnosed with Addison's Disease, an autoimmune disorder similar to Type 1 Diabetes but instead of insuline my body no longer produces cortisol as well as a few other hormones.  Most of the money I have left has been going to doctors and pharmacies to keep me healthy and I could really use some help keeping myself fed. I've been lurking on the sight for a while and finally worked up the courage to ask for some help.  If anyone out there could help out I'd return the favor as soon as I could and would be forever thankful.  
0	This month has been really hard on my family and I. We have had to pay our rent, car, and gas all late because of shortened hours at work. I am the only one working right now because my wife is on maternity leave which makes money really low. I have two children who love pizza and have been affected by this unfortunate turn of events. I promise to pay forward as soon as I get more hours from work.  
0	If this works, I will buy someone else a pizza next week.
1	21/m/sfbay multi year lurker first time poster! me! -&gt; http://imgur.com/VXtY6  I'm just really hungry and I've got no money right now. Been unemployed for 6 months but just got a real great job offer at a consulting firm in berkeley. so i'd like to do something special to celebrate but i'm in the red right now.  after jan 2nd i will be employed with a well paying job and will definitely pay it forward.  I'm stoked!
0	I don't really know what to put here. I guess I will put my favorite pizza combo haha.   Meat lovers with green peppers onions and jalepenos(not sure how to spell this without the line thing). 
0	Let me start off by saying, I'm taking online classes to become a fully registered nurse, some of my expenses lately have been piling up at home   (I live with my mother, also a caregiver although she is full-time whereas I'm part-time because of school)   Honestly, I've been financially strapped this last month, and had to cut some expenses on foodstuffs at home, as well as the lunch I pack to work.   Finished my ham sandwich this morning I packed, and still dealing with the bipolar flare-ups of my patient, if anyone could provide some much needed brain-fuel so I can make it through this day a little easier, I'd really appreciate it :)  I promise to try to gift someone back next month when me and my mother get our paychecks from our patients' family.  
0	[This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO3U56gTi2U) is what I'll be listening to for the next while hoping that my request reaches an open heart.  I have no money, little food, and high hopes of receiving a pizza.  I'll draw you a cool pizza-related picture!
0	I bought a new motorcycle yay!  http://imgur.com/a/lZZQz  Just got my helmet and gauntlets in today. Just excited to share, not really relevant.   I haven't ordered a pizza in the 2 years I've been in Ames.  I just don't like the idea of a poor guy driving a pizza out to me and feel obligated to tip well.  Unfortunately I don't have much money so I don't order pizza.  That didn't stop me from buying a bike 0_o.  I only eat once a day, usually dinner after I get done working all day.  It doesn't bother me, in-fact my stomach is tiny now and I don't even notice I'm hungry.  I might go take a nap but I've always heard about this subreddit but missing the domino's pizza contest made me hungry for pizza, it'll subside after a day or 2 I hope but in the mean-time I wanted to post.  I went from 6'1 186 pounds (still skinny) to 163 pounds apparently this not eating stuff is really good at cutting weight.  I was trying to put on weight (muscle) though.  Pizza doesn't really help with that though, don't know why I have a craving for it.  
1	hello all,  I am a 24 year old guy who just graduated from university. I have a job, but with rent/bills I have no funds until I get paid on Wednesday. I have been eating beans and rice which is not so bad, but its starting to taste like mush. if anyone could help out, id be sure to pay it forward in the near future.   thanks! 
0	Hey guys, I'm starving, and currently have no money on me. I'm house sitting my friend's and there is NO food in the entire place, so I have no way to eat at the moment. I'm not broke, just hungry. I'll repay the favor, and am willing to work for it!  Thanks all, you're the best.
0	I'm exhausted from this week, and I'll be honest, I don't want to cook. My kids have played their little hearts out today and we're all in agreement that a pizza would really hit the spot (and really, when could it not?) They go out to their dad's house all next week and this would be a great close to the busy, hot week. Can you help us out?
1	Posting from my phone (contract expires next Wednesday) as we have no wifi. Girlfriend and I met on the Internet, have been in a long-distance relationship (with monthly visits) for ten months. Just moved into a new apartment with her last week. I'm the happiest I've been in a long time, but we are pretty tight on money. I'm job-hunting, she works at a minimum wage fast food restaurant (she brings food back from her job, which is how we eat right now). A pizza or two would be nice if anyone has a few extra bucks lying around. We can handle the delivery guy's tip. Thanks. 
0	thank you
1	Hello. This is my novelty account in place of my real 2-year one. People have quickly forgotten about this masterpiece of a book. I decided not to perpetuate anything to do with Palin anyway.  I've never asked the internet for assistance, so be gentle with me. I live in Austin and I don't have too much longer on my degree. I had a work-study job, but since I'm not taking summer classes, I don't anymore. I have $4 to get me through the week. If some nice guy or gal could send a pizza my way, I'd be blown away. Two mediums could feed me for 3 days  As a token of my gratitude, I could send you a picture of me and said pizza or write a paragraph for you in an interesting foreign language (which I will keep secret for now ;) ).   Thank you.
1	I'm at home, in between work earlier and work later, drinking some beer, and have no pizza to go with it. I am very sad. I read the sidebar, too, but I don't know if I am doing the steps right because there are a lot of words over there.   When I get home from work later, I'll probably buy a pizza for a nice hungry person though. Pizza for me now, pizza for you later.  Here is me with my beer: http://i.imgur.com/A6n1k.jpg  Here is me without pizza: http://i.imgur.com/vMOYJ.jpg
1	I need an e-gift card for Dominos, I will pay it forward as soon as possible. My situation: Lost my job a few weeks back and just ran out of money yesterday, I have a job interview tomorrow and I would really like to not arrive at the interview while starved. 
0	We are some dudes in Norwich, CT studying for various classes and we could use some food. We are college students low on money and hungry for some pizza. 
1	We moved to Austin recently, and our spare food money was in a PayPal account. We overlooked that our PayPal debit card expired back in April. We've contacted PayPal already, and the debit card is in the mail, and should be arriving tomorrow. All we have until then is several packs of Ramen noodles. Any help would be greatly appreciated!  Edit: I have someone calling in an order for me, for which I am grateful.  Edit2: I have the pizza on the way. Thanks go to gratefulstringcheese!
0	Hey there Reddit, I've been working on a art request thread over [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Favors/comments/nxily/offer_art_student_in_dire_need_of_practice_ill/)  But my roommate and I would love some pizza, but can't spend money on it since we're saving for our next semester that starts Monday.  One of my roommates books is $200 D:  and I just need to get tons of supplies.    To whoever buys us a pizza from pizza hut, we'll draw you what ever you want!  Or we'll draw you tons of cats, what ever you want!  (We're also saving for a cat)  We're in Grand Rapids, Mi if that helps anyone.    We shall wait here playing Links awakening, and don't worry if you don't buy us any - go buy pizza for someone that really hungry.  We're just bored and would appreciate a pizza.  
0	Broke as hell and having to move back in with my mom in a week. Would love a pizza to lift the spirits. I'll live either way, but figured maybe someone would be kind :) &lt;3
1	Being 17 and being payed $30 a week to walk a dog (with gas for the car taking up about $25 of it), I can't really pay for pizza that much. So, if anyone's feeling the Pizzamas spirit, hit me up!
0	Hey, I live in Bremerton, Washington and currently I'm babysitting my cousins for about a week while my aunt goes on vacation with her husband, My grandpa currently has the money and he only spends the money on beer and cigerattes and we're almost out completely. I was hoping that someone would be kind enough to buy a pizza for us, as we're knd of sick of cereal. ;-;
0	I'm not poor or anything but my fellow redditor room mate and I are starving and the fridge is kind of on the empty side. Anybody out there wanna help a couple of their fellow redditors!    Louisville, kentucky. Stay classy reddit!
1	2 more days until payday and my man and I are starving! Anyone care to help us out? We'll gladly return the favor on Thursday when he gets paid! We've been reading through these stories and you folks are the best, glad to see that someone out there still has a heart for people far worse off than us!  edit: Forgot our location, we're in Austin texas!!
0	One Pizza Please. Thank you Reddit.
0	Music ain't paying too well and all I've got left are 4 slices of bread, and some butter until I get paid on thursday... a large pizza would keep me going for the next 2 days or so... I can verify however you wish.  I'll send you some songs I have recorded to say thanks if you wish :)
0	This is my first time here, I would love to see how it works. So, may I please have a pizza. 
0	I started a new job and I get paid on thursday but until then I have no money for food. I'm barely scraping pennies to give to friends for rides too and from work. Any help would be very appreciated. Edit: I forgot to mention I WILL pay it forward as soon as I get paid &lt;3
0	It's about 3 in the morning and I want pizza. I have no sob story, made up or otherwise, to entice you to give me some of your extra dough for pizza.
0	Let's be honest, who wants to leave the house with an ace bandage around their head and stitches that look like spiders on their face?   I had surgery on my neck Tuesday, and my neck and face are covered in bruises. I've managed to stay inside for since then, and hope a few more days will help with the situation.   I don't mind sending a verification pic of the bruising to any of you kind folks, and hope to return the kindness of yummies sometime soon.  Thank you for taking  the time to look, either way!  Edit: Took the bandages off for a moment, stitches and bruises ahoy! http://i.imgur.com/vpO54ZD.jpg
0	So the other day, a pack of flaming rabid monkeys entered my house and asked politely for a sandwich. They were too adorable, setting my house on fire and all, so I gave them a turkey sandwich. Right at that moment, my bank waddled in the door in a penguin costume and yelled, "Stop right there! You're now in debt one turkey sandwich!" I cried and cried; I was completely out of turkey sandwiches. I asked him if there was anything else I could do, and he said I could give him a pizza. So please, someone help me out here.  Also, to those who are thinking 'what an idiot', [check this out.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/j7naj/just_something_id_like_to_get_off_my_chest/)
0	Simple as that.  I'd love to eat something other than raman and can return the favor when I get a job.  Going searching today, wish me luck!  Edit:  Thanks, Causeimgb!
1	Hey, thanks for reading this post. I'm a college student living in Hamilton ohio, I've just finished pulling my third all nighter for a final project in the last four days. I'm really hungry and would LOVE a pizza tonight since it seems I'll be up again. I would love an e-card to larosas, papa johns, or marcos, since those are the only places within a reasonable driving distance for me.  Again, thank you for reading this post, and REALLY thank you if someone decides to make my fourth all nighter a lot less depressing. 
0	A friend told me that this subreddit exists. That alone has made my evening. I don't really know how this works, but I figured it cannot hurt to post a request.  I don't have much to offer in return, aside from my gratitude and the promise that when I have cash on hand I'll pay it forward. I just recently moved back in with my Dad and step-mom after life took a bit of a turn, and being able to show up with dinner would be great for both them and me.
0	I could really use a pizza right now.  It's my friend and I, and we have nothing to eat / no money.. and his car is in the shop.  So if one of you fine gentlemen , or fine ladies, could give us delicious, hot, circular-shaped heaven.. We would be most grateful.
0	Hey, I just got off work (11:37pm EST) and have tons of Lab reports to do and a quiz to study for in the morning. Also the paychecks at my work didn't go through this weekend, due to veteran's day on friday, so I wont get paid until tomorrow. I have no money and no time to prepare the scraps I have. Would greatly appreciate a pizza and can pay it forward once my check goes through tomorrow!
0	im in philly area, 19128   THANKS!
0	Hi! This is my first time here. I've never actually posted before. Not entirely sure how this works, but I figured I'd give it a shot. I'm hungry, and a pizza would be awesome! Thanks to anyone that helps.  
0	Hello, I was thrown through some hoops at my old job, which resulted in me not working for a whole month (without any heads up that i would not be working). I was smart with what money I had left and paid my next months rent and groceries. I am starting to run out of food now and will not be able to purchase any for another week. If anyone would be kind enough to brighten my day with a pizza, I would GREATLY appreciate it and pass on the good deed once I get back on my feet.
0	I was laid off 2 months ago and due to bureaucratic bullshit I still haven't received any employment insurance. Damn, maybe I wont get any! Today I realized that after my rent is paid, I only have 9 bucks left...   I don't really worry about food because I have a lot of rice and beans. But I'm getting really tired of rice and beans, rice pudding, fried rice, bean stew and etc. I crave for a pizza! But, I don't like asking for help. So if i get a pizza, I promise it's going to be a "today you, tomorrow me" thing. As soon as I get a new job or my EI, I will give back a pizza to someone on this sub!  Thanks in advance!
0	Well, here is the sob story.  I just moved in with my sister and brother in law.. They bought a new house and need a roommate, and knowing that I am just out of college and looking for work and all that.. they got me to do it. :P  The first week I moved down here, the small amount of money that I had to get through to find a job was frozen in my bank account because Bank of America is such a PoS. I was literally down here a week, and without any notice/phone call/email.. etc. they froze my account and reissued my debit card back to my parents house where I was living (a days trip away, in another state). I was there planning to cancel my account, when they told me I was going to be unable to do so without my new card... that was a couple of days away in the mail. So basically I am broke as shit. :/  I just started my new job down here, but they pay bi-weekly. I just received my first check, but it immediately had to go to the new bank that I have for student loans and car insurance, to avoid late payments. So for the next two weeks I am broke and even have to bum gas money off of my sister to get to work until I am paid, and she cant really afford to be helping me as much as she is already.  I'd really like to do something nice for her in the meantime... so, anyone want to give me a hand?  Sorry for the wall of text... and not really sure of what else to do, just found this awesome subreddit :)
0	Hi! So I found out about this pretty cool idea while surfing the web. There were a lot of stories about needy college students so I thought someone out there could help me. It's my second week of classes and the food here is just horrible. My roommate and I have been trying to get some decent food but cash is so tight with books/fees. Scholarship money doesn't come in for at least another week. HELP US PLEASE!  We found a coupon to get a large pizza and cheesesticks for $10 from pizza hut. We have promised each other to do this for someone else once our checks get in. Thanks for considering us!
0	I get paid on Friday and don't have any more room for Pizza on my credit card.  I'm not in a terrible situation or starving or anything my puppy and I just want to get on the Pizza train here :).  Also... new to RAOP buttt I read the sidebar.
1	I live in a small house with my Grandma and my Boyfriend, He is visiting from Ireland and he is leaving in 5 days. My gramma has been low on work, and shes 58 and I haven't found a job yet. Finally being of age to get a job i figured it would be easy but in this economy its not.  I'm NOT starving, but I am hungry for that warm cheesy pepperoni taste of pizza straight from the oven. I've Mowed lawns around my neighborhood to put food in my house and i'm running low on cash. Food is scarce and i have to wait till my grandmas next pay day for gas. Please help me and my boyfriend and grandma have a delicious dinner tonight. It would be much appreciated.   Even if i and my family don't get one, when i get a job i will be sure to help others here. 
1	Basically don't have much cash for the next two weeks until the next part of my student grant comes in.   Near the end of a massive design engineering project and it's getting pretty stressful.   Not much in the cupboards and i've been eating rice and beans for the past few days. Thanks r/frugal.  Would love a tasty pizza and I'll pay back into the community once I get a bit more cash.   Peace
0	im an aspiring music producer/college student... a broke, hungry one :/ check out my work here. i will remix the song of your choice in exchange for a pizza. http://soundcloud.com/mindcntrl
0	It's cold, I'n hungry, and to be completely honest I'm broke. My mum said we're having leftovers for dinner. A random pizza arriving would be nice.  Edit: We had leftovers.
0	Unfortunate events has put me and bad situation until Friday, my electricity went out mid day afternoon, and i wont have the funds to pay it until friday. Cant cook or anything until then and really dont have the ends to feed my kids. Looking for a little help to then, anything would be appreciated 
1	I am really hungry, not too broke but i need the rest of my money which is only 23$ to last me until Monday (i get paid) , and i still need to buy gas for work, my fridge is empty. No sob story im just honestly really hungry and would like it if someone could donate me a pizza and i would love to repay the favor to the giver or someone else on the site, idk maybe we can work somethings out. Thank you.
0	[I don't have a reason, but I'd like a pizza anyway.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERXq3r1Kq0Q)  Edit: I got hungry and fulfilled my own request. Thanks, /u/caerul!
0	I'm not entirely sure why, I guess just kindof a sad day. Cheer me up?
0	I woke up yesterday to Marla gasping for breath, and Mia was just grooming her. Now Mia doesn't know what to do and honestly either do I. Ugh.  We live in Tacoma, WA.
1	I'm honestly not the kind of girl to ask for handouts, but I just can't make ends meet anymore and I don't get paid until Friday. I just spent my last $30 on dog food, because he comes before me.  If anyone would be so kind I promise to pass it on once I am established again. Thanks for reading.
0	I have an 18 month old daughter and a 3 1/2 week old daughter. I am a single mother and my oldest daughter and I have a very tight bond bc I am the only person that has ever been constant in her life. I have been doing my best with trying to show her as much attention and affection as possible after having my second daughter but I can tell that my oldest daughter is having some problems adjusting to having to share my attention with her sister. My oldest daughter loves pizza...she gets so excited everytime we have pizza and she likes to eat all of the toppings and then the crust. She also likes to paint on her high chair with the pizza sauce lol!!! I would really like to have a mommy and daughter pizza and movie night but finances are really tight now that I am trying to learn how to budget for 3 people and 2 of them are in diapers. If anyone could help out and buy gift some pizza for my baby girl so I can give her a special fun night to help show her that mommy still loves her just as much as I ever have. I will definetly pay if forward and offer to gift someone else a pizza as soon as I financially can. Thank you!!!
0	Been pretty hungry lately, it's hard to find a job since I have no prior experience so I have no regular source of income. My college gives out refund checks but not until August 2nd. Could really go for a pizza or hell even just some breadsticks I don't really care. If you need any other reason, my 21st birthday is August 10th, and also I live in Ohio. That should be the biggest reason, this place blows. Any thing would be appreciated! 
0	No Sob Story. I am at work and all i have it the chicken the turned rock hard in the fridge...
0	Just a college student trying to save some bucks.   **Update:**   **Cancelling the Request.** Got too hungry and went ahead and ordered myself a pizza. Maybe next time I won't get so impatient  :) 
0	I left my house at 7:00 and I'm just getting home now, 9:00pm. The crazy long commute is a regular thing for me. It a pain in the ass. Oh, and my SO is gone for the weekend, no close friends are around and I have nothing else to do on this Friday night other than reddit and watching tv shows online.   Maryland...
0	just kidding, obviously not on the ISS.  But having been unemployed for a bit and using any extra money for bills I am a bit tired of ramen and rice.  It'd just be nice to have some pizza. But at the same time if there is another person who is having a tough time and needing pizza, give it to them.  Because I'll be alright, I have ramen :)
0	My friend I think deserves a RAOP. No need to say exact reasons, but this would certainly make him feel a whole lot better. Thanks everyone. 
0	Hey Redditors  Been sitting here, enjoying the Steam Sale, helping some redditors get some games. Gave away about $70 worth of games in the past 24 hours. I would love to get a pizza. 
0	I recently just had surgery to have my upper and lower jaw broken. My jaw was wired shut for 6 weeks. The only thing i ate other than liquid was mashed potatoes...so now that I can eat solids, I'm giving Reddit first chance to feed me.   P.S. I have 0 dollars as i have not been working and my mom will not pay for me as she is not a supporter of Pizza (shame on her).
1	Hey ROAP, I would love to surprise my family with a pizza tonight. We have no money until tomorrow night and our only option until then is thin spaghetti with ranch dressing :D We can do it, but a pizza would be appreciated more than you know! I promise to pay it forward once we get back on our feet. Thanks :)  Wesley Chapel, Florida  EDIT: Just finished a delicious pizza from rogers4201! THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH!!
1	Yep, i'm still unemployed, short on money and would be very happy about receiving a pizza today. It doesn't matter where you live as long as you own a credit card or paypal we can handle this. Thanks guys.
1	Hey RAOPers!  Yesterday was my undergraduate graduation where I earned my BS in Chemical Engineering and I am looking to celebrate with some pizza goodness.  I'm still looking for a job but as soon as I find one I am planning on paying it forward and purchasing a piled high pizza for a person in need (alliteration intended).  Thanks so much!  EDIT: /u/kgros004 was kind enough to offer me a pizza for this Thursday and I should be able to hold off my pizza cravings until then.  Thanks!
0	I'm feeling pretty melancholy. Will be driving 40 minutes on the last gasoline that I have to the RMV to get a new driver's license tomorrow. Luckily, my brother lives nearby, so he's going to lend me the money I need to get a new license. Any size pizza of any type from any nearby place would go a very long way for me (tomorrow would be fantastic, but so would any time this week!) I haven't been able to go food shopping yet this week as I don't get paid until Friday so I have almost nothing to eat here.  Much love guys and thank you for reading.
0	I've never posted here before, but I'll gladly pay it forward when I get the chance. Most major pizza places are within delivery or driving distance from where I live. Thanks in advance if anyone is feeling generous :)
0	I am a mother of two a 3 yr old and a 5 month old we are in tough times living at my mothers house trying to find a place to live. I am a stay at home mother while my fiancee works a full time minimum wage job to try to scrape by. due to the past few tough weeks my mother has decided that we have to leave by the beginning of august. I have just spent the last of our food stamps and money on our baby boy to buy him formula.  we are broke stressed out and in need of someone to raise our spirits. 
0	Me and 2 of my classmates are stuck in the lounge in my building for hours doing our lab report for a materials processing lab. If anyone could help us out with a pizza, we would definitely return the favor!
0	First things first: I'm twenty and I live with my mother. In tennessee. There's pretty much a whole lot of things out of reach for me due to the fact of residential areas being in the asscrack of nowhere. I'm an amateur game developer who's studying to actually start developing but can't really do that without fuel for attentionspan. It's complicated. Anyway, if you send me pizza, I'll credit you by reddit username in obnoxiously huge, flashing letters in my first kongregate submission, Snap into a genocide (whose gameplay is completely unrelated to the title). And if you're a pretty rad dude for lack of a better agendered word, we can be friends. and-- while I would love any pizza, pizza hut's kinda gross in this area. I live in shannon glen, which is in spring hill. I encourage you to googlemaps it and see why I'm requesting. Thanks!
0	Im sorry for having to ask. I know thats the whole point but I always feel bad for asking for help. I am a 22yo veteran of the Army Reserve who is currently being medically discharged for Bipolar Affective Disorder type 2(severe depression, dysphoric hypomania). I have tried to work but I have chest pains and anxiety attacks from ptsd. I try my hardest to hold out but i cant work if Im curled up in the bathroom praying for death. Im just trying to explain why Im so broke. I cant get any VA benefits until my claim is processed(months from now) so I have to pay for my meds out of pocket. I make 20$ a week taking an experimental sleep medication in a clinical trial but most of that goes to bus fare, meds(Ive got a few rx's), and stretching out food. I applied for food stamps but my card was delayed(stolen out of mailbox) and now I wont see it until a couple weeks. Im living with my roommate who has been kind enough to only ask me for 50 a month in rent, but that leaves little room for pizza! I honestly havent had a pizza this year. Its one of the few things that makes me feel better, like theres something to live for and look forward to again. maybe Im not the most deserving, but it would really help me out. Thanks for reading this.
1	My mom recently had major back surgery for a car accident she had years ago, and was in recovery when she contracted MRSA (Blood infection immune to oral antibiotics) and she has to give herself antibiotics through an IV line with a syringe every day. She also has a home health care nurse come in every day and Pack her surgical wound and push out any infectious puss that might build up. It's a pretty painful process. Her injury in the accident came right after she got her Commercial Driver's License and was about to become a truck driver, now she can't work at all. We're extremely low on food until our food stamps come in. My mom's Doctor's our pressuring her to gain weight or they're going to put her in a nursing home. She only weighs 85 pounds, and it would be amazing if a friendly Redditor helped us out.
1	Stuck at work until midnight - not much around to munch on. Feel a bit guilty - ended up spending my pizza money helping out some people in /r/assistance. Will gladly pizza it forward after the 28th. 
0	Would absolutely love a pizza this evening...not feelin' too hot, no pun intended and don't have the energy to cook. I'd be happy with a knuckle sandwich w/mayo about now.
1	I have no food and not a single cent to my name til Friday not mention a past due bill. Stomach sound awful. Really could use a pie.
0	I just got back from a vacation with my dad, and I get home to my mom's, and it turns out she's gone vegan. A nice pepperoni pizza would make not only my day, but my week, or even quite possibly my month. All the thanks in the world if you decide to help out. :) 
1	I've heard of this sub-reddit, but today is the first time I've stopped by. For some reason I can't stop thinking about pizza! [Doctor's Orders](http://imgur.com/4loB6)
0	I just have no money at all to help them but they could really use an unexpected happy moment! We have rice and beans and will not starve,but the kids honestly hate the same meal again and again. I will have the oppurtunity to pass the pizza along in a couple weeks when things have grown more stable here. Not sure how exactly to verify as I have no camera but please feel free to message me!
0	Well my son has a bad cold and has been up the last few nights ALL night long. Needless to say we aren't getting much sleep! A nice hot pizza would be a great pick me up and a great way to get out of cooking for one night! I'm no one special, but i thought I'd give this a try! I'll pay it forward after the first of the month! Thanks for reading!  
0	Two Students Based in Liverpool, Very Skint at the moment, would appreciate to have such a luxury!  Cheers
0	I've been working since 5 without a meal since 9:30am and that entails being hung up on because I'm a college student trying to fill out surveys and that means I have to interrupt people at dinner time. If anyone wants to help me feed myself while I try not get too bothered by people hating me, I would love you forever and be permanently indebted.
0	Now, don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with Ramen. It's gotten me through some tough times, and it's getting me through them right now. My girlfriend gets off work in 15 minutes and then faces a 3 hour bus ride home from her call center (she has the most inconveniently scheduled layovers on her route...she has to sit at the transit station for an hour either way she does it). I just moved to the area to be with her because I love her, and haven't been able to find a job to help support us yet, which is unfortunate because her roommate just bailed on her. I did manage to secure a 200/mo food stamp benefit, which renews on the first of the month. But we couldn't manage to make it stretch the whole month our first time around, and we've been living off Ramen since the weekend. I'm sure we'll be able to properly ration ourselves next month, if we're more careful. And I have no problem living on ramen. I just want to do something nice for her since I feel like I'm sitting on my ass all day not contributing anything, looking for jobs on craigslist while she's away at work/stuck on the bus. She's been really upset about the money situation lately, and I just want her to be happy. Unfortunately, she is not as pleased with the Ramen diet as I am. I would give anything to be able to give her something better than this to come home to.  Sorry for that wall of text/sob story. I don't expect anything but I'm not doing anything right now but sitting on my ass waiting for her to get here, so posting this can't hurt.   edit: Thank you reddit! Pics will be posted as thanks!  edit 2: As promised, her [face when she found out](http://i.imgur.com/k8bmxh.jpg)  [AWWWWWW YEAHHHHHH](http://i.imgur.com/kpcZdh.jpg)
1	I'm just having the greatest of days. My phone's been shut off due to lack of payment, I ran out of gas on the way home from work today, been working for the last 6 days and I still don't get paid until Friday. Looking at the last two bricks of ramen that I have left makes my heart sink. Could anyone make my heart soar again? I would be willing to pay forward a pie after pay day 7/1/11
0	My wallet was stolen this morning, it had my passport card, debit card, school ID, a couple of prescriptions, and all of my money. My checking account has $5 in it, so I really mean *all* of my money.  I'm really not in the mood to deal with this right now, and I don't know when my next paycheck's coming in the mail. (Should have been mailed on Thursday, but my employer's payroll office is notoriously unreliable)  I'm a college student living near Albany, NY, and would love any kind of assistance.
0	First time playing Tijuana, Mexico earlier this week and I was a little sketched out. I didnt have a passport just my drivers license but I was told that would work. I made every precaution to play it safe, not taking it out and aware of my surroundings. When I placed my wallet in my jacket and set it next to my amp before I went on, someone grabbed it and it was nowhere to be found. Had to pass through secondary which was a 2 1/2 wait and ended up calling my mom to bring my birth certificate over. I lost my credit card, my newly acquired license, debit card, spare car key, a couple gift cards, and my triple a car. Waiting for friday to get paid, Im living off pb and j sandwiches and right now pizza sounds great.
1	Just started school at Cuesta College in San Luis Obispo, CA. I didn't realize it would take so long before I started to see any money from my GI bill. A real meal would be nice.
0	By the grace of god i've made it this far..never really thought i would... my b-day is  feb 2 1987:)and i would love to have some pizza tonight...i dont have any money till the 3rd... If anyone would like to buy me a pizza i'll turn the favor next week. thanks so much and god bless
0	As the title says I was hit by a drunk driver. It was 2am last night and was 5 blocks away from my friends house. I was driving him home after his farewell party, he is leaving the city on Monday.   I was coming down a one way street with the right of way and no stop sign/light. He blew thru a stop sign and t-boned me. Before I even got out of my car to start dealing with everything he fled the scene leaving his friend behind in the passenger seat. This guy was visibly drunk and acted as if nothing happened. He fled 20 min after it happened.  I don't get paid until the end of the month but will pay forward as soon as I get my paycheck.  TL;DR drunk drivers suck
0	still waiting for a check to show up, and could really use a pizza to get by for the next couple of days. any thing would help.
0	i was gonna tell a story about how my wife cheated on me and threw me out of the house and i left my wallet inside, but instead i just want to see if i can get a pizza randomly. i live in fremont ohio
1	It turns out that spaghetti every night isn't as appetizing as I once thought it was...  Broke, hungry and lookin' for some greasy lovin's.  To cheer up after crazy bitch roommate jacked the T.V.  Will send smiling thank you picture!
0	I'm 37weeks pregnant and would love nothing more than a Stuffed Crust Super Supreme Pizza mmmm (mouth watering) Just something I am craving but we don't have the money to splurge on right now ;-) Please b my Pizza Angel :)
0	Things haven't been great, honestly. They haven't been horrible but, well fuck it.  I'm a broke college student. I lost a lot of money on a bad business investment (not as sketchy as it sounds though) and I've had to turn to sketchy odd jobs and prostitution in order to pay rent.  I mean I'm getting a new job with my college soon, which is great. But that doesn't even start until...later &gt;_&gt;  Alright so my life isn't that bad. But seriously though can I please have a pizza? There must be some other white, too rich for student aid, too poor to pay for college (literally 90% of my college is being paid for on loans) person who understands my plight.  Also I know my username says ConservativeVictory but if it helps my case I voted for Jon Huntsman and then Ron Paul out of spite to Romney. Actually voted for Gary Johnson even though I'm really not that far right at all just because I didn't care for Romney and Johnson was a pretty good at being a Governor imo.  Anyways srsly though please get me food =/ I literally have like, 3 ramen left.. not sure what happens after that.
0	I've had a rough year, and am currently at a job where my boss criticizes me left and right because I'm not an aggressive enough salesperson, so I'm using all my resources to find other employment. I'm just a quiet person, and respect people too much to manipulate them into buying something. I know I hate it when it's done to me, so I couldn't do it to another person.  So I'm requesting a pizza to help relax and just unwind for the first time in this year. I absolutely intend to pizza it forward on payday.  Thank you.
0	I'll keep this short and simple.          The only food I have until Saturday or Sunday is eggs and some crackers. A pizza would feed me until Thursday or Friday, and I can deal with eggs and crackers until I can get some Ramen and other cheap food-stuffs this weekend.      My money situation is about as crappy as it can possibly be, but I will buy someone a fat, loaded pizza as soon as I'm able, I promise. I love this subreddit and what it's all about.          EDIT: I just got a super delicious pizza (and some wings and coke!) from killingtheclock. Thank you! :)
0	My life has gotten pretty crazy over the past 2 weeks. Two of my good friends are sleeping in my living room (one just got divorced and moved back here from another state, he does some under the table work but is running low on cash. The other has just had some bad luck in life and has had a few offers that look promising, so I'm letting him stay until one goes through.) My boyfriend just started working again after being out of work for a few months, but he doesn't get paid until tomorrow. Rent was due this week and all that's left in my cupboard is cheap canned soup. Pizza would really help the morale around here, and I'll pay it forward at the end if the month (I've got 2 weeks of over time coming up.)
1	My birthday is on July 4th and I was wondering if anyone would be so kind as to get me something to eat. I'm turning 19 this year! Please NO DOMINOS! I recently quit my job there and i would rather not see anyone that works there for a while.  I live 5 minutes away from East Lansing, MI (Close to Michigan State University)
0	I am flat broke. I feel silly for even requesting this- but a pizza would be kinda awesome. Tired of the ramen and tuna salad I have been living on the past 2 weeks. If anyone could help, they would be my hero. 
0	So... long story short, I'm crashing at my mother's because I'm moving back to this area for a new job I start tomorrow. We don't get along all that great, especially when it comes to food things. She had a pack of burger patties and a pack of brats in her freezer, which I thawed, but apparently am not allowed to cook because "it would stink up the house" and offend her quasi-vegetarian "I don't eat mammals" sensibilities. Nor is there any other readily available food in the house, and I'm broke pending employment and will be saving every scrap to get into an apartment ASAP...
0	Just got off a 14 hour day courtesy of the holiday weekend, and my wife is at my sisters house for her baby shower. New appartment, so no food i know how to cook, and she is still waitin on a transfer to the local kroger so we've been short her check for two weeks.  I figure someone out in the houston area that enjoy's their beer wouldn't mind helping out a hungry guy who spent all day filling up shelves with budweiser to keep all you drunks out there happy :)  *EDIT* Pizza recieved courtesy of http://www.reddit.com/user/ninjaliwa in his offer thread, in which he was generous enough to send some to several people, so many thanks to him from everyone it looks like he ended up sending pizza to
0	I have been at school for 2 weeks with a personal check from my dad, and no bank account. I cannot cash this check and have no usable money at present. I bummed a 1.50 so I could enjoy a soda today, living on cafeteria food, water, and lemonade.
0	Had a small breakfast this morning, but after 10 hours at school, and nothing besides sandwiches at home, I'd really enjoy a pizza if anyone's willing. :)  If not, thanks anyways!
0	Dreamin' of a Pizza, waiting for a locksmith.  It's been a long day. A long groovy day, save for a moment of brilliance wherein I bravely locked my keys securely away in my vehicle. I was startled by a child with a airsoft pain inflictor; instinct demanded I slam the door shut and turn to face the culprit. I am a smart, brave man.  Anyway, evening plans are kinda shot now. I'm chilling out, waiting for a locksmith, hoping it won't eradicate the funds I need to float on blissfully towards that next paycheck.   If I am blessed by pizza, I'll happily pay it forward. If not, I may be forced to hunt down and devour that small child.
1	Last year, I had to kick my ex out (he was threatening me), and in order to support myself, I took on a second job.  During that time, I bought a pizza for someone who was struggling.  They never came back to thank me :(  But I still felt good :)  Early this year, I had to quit the second job - my doctor said the additional stress was causing hypertension, among other things.  Now, I'm struggling to pay all my bills.  I currently have less than a dollar in my checking account, and missed work yesterday due to illness.  It'd be great to receive a pizza - to be able to skip having to cook tonight since I'm still under the weather.  Any help would be appreciated.  Promise!  :D  Thanks
1	We are in Cambridge, MD. I'm a single father and am broke until next Friday because of some car issues the past week. My daughter and I would love to nosh on some pizza tonight, but I can't afford the pie! Definitely looking to pay it forward this coming Friday when the cash comes back around.
0	I'm not starving or anything, so if someone else posts with a much more dire situation than me, I'd encourage you to send pizza to them. I'm just hungry and have been craving pizza for the past few days, but haven't had any pocket money. That's all. (:
0	I'd really love some pizza, preferably Papa Johns but any would do, honestly. I'm in the LA area due east. Thanks everyone for your infinite kindness!
1	After spending two and a half months unemployed, the universe seemed to have the BEST sense of humour, and I landed three interviews today (two face-to-face, one over the phone). I absolutely NAILED them, and feeling like next week I'm going to have jobs fighting over me. (Longer success story [here.](http://redd.it/ojvu1)) So I'm feeling pretty damn good. But you know what would make me fly on absolute Cloud 9 right now? A good ol' pizza!  First time asking.
1	hi my name is Jessica im 21 curreny living with my mom who is unemployed. I work 20 hours a week at a minimum wage job trying to support us both. I was wondering if I could possibly please have a pizza to just try and forget about all the drama with money and enjoy a nice meal with my mom. I can do the verification system if needed! Its not a dire need just a want. Please it would mean Alot to us
1	I'm a college student, so I don't have much money, and I'm home (in Texas, if that's important) over Christmas break. But I've been sick this whole week. My whole family is gone to work or school and I don't have much energy for making food. A small pizza, even just bread sticks, would be nice. Thanks for reading this :)
0	There`s these ladies who always work in the Wilson subway station. One of them has a toddler and brings her over all the time. They work so hard, and they deserve to have a slice of pizza. Maybe crowd their business and make a lot of purchases or tips. Because sometimes I see the tip cup and it`s only filled with quarters. Let`s turn those quarters into dollars, into bills!
0	As the title says, it's been a rough month for my family for a number of reasons financial troubles being on the top of the list. My reason for posting is that groceries have been pretty sparce for the past week or so. The kids, wife and I have been had our fill of bland pastas and such. Payday is in less than a week and the generosity of friends and family in addition to picking up odd jobs here and there are the only things that have gotten us through this month.  Long story short, a pizza sounds unbelievably awesome right about now, even more so when imagine the how excited the kids would be after a week of serving dinner to sad face and disappointed grumbles.
0	Anything to eat. My gf and i are house sitting. Have no food or money. We get paid on saturday for the house sitting.. We dont want to eat the food of the house and cannot get a hold of the house owners to ask. My check is a day late. My company can be shaky with paying on time. (Direct deposit) Today is honestly the worst timing yet. I humbly ask to my fellows members of the internet. I am about to tell her the bag of pop corn we ate IS our Thanksgiving. 
0	I don't get paid for several days and my grocery money had to be used for my gas tank, and to me, my gas tank takes priority (so I can get to work to make money to buy food). Anything would be welcome but preferences are Jet's or Pizza Hut. Be kind. I will be paying it forward when I do get paid.
0	yeah...I'm really craving a good pizza. sadly, i have no money to afford one, and no job to make the money to buy one.. jobs are scarce here, and so is a good slice of delicious thin crust pizza. so RAOP? anyone willing to help me fulfill this serious craving?
1	Hey guys, I just paid my rent here in Richmond. I have maybe 2 to 3 dollars left in my account? I haven't had a nice hot pepperoni pizza in awhile (besides those cheap mini frozen ones)! Also, just found out this morning that our Internet cut out because of the wiring in our building? But I still had to pay the bill for that last week despite complains of no service. Anyway, just looking for some kindness of random pizza!
0	I just moved here (from Texas) to gain residency for BU. In the past month I've gotten hit by a car and broke my dominant wrist, got the flu, my upstairs neighbors flooded my living room making it unusable, my job won't let me work because of my cast, I couldn't afford school, my mom lost her job, the entire city flooded, and now the pipes in my kitchen are severly leaking so the repair guy turned off the water and have completely disassembled my kitchen. I can't use the water in my apartment for two days (that includes cooking....and my stove is currently in the living room too.) A pizza would be great :/
0	So I was a bit, over zealous with my black Friday purchases.   I'll be planning to forward a pizza later on once I recover from my purchasing of a new computer &gt;.&lt;
0	I tried everything before coming here, and I still feel bad for doing this, but I came here to beg for food. I'm a (forgive the cliché) poor college student. Every food service location on campus is closed (and even so, I only have $3 left for food), and I have no money in my bank account. I really just need something to eat before I head home in the morning. I can't really offer anything, but what I can do is promise to pay it forward.  **TL;DR:** I really just need one more meal before tomorrow.  I'll certainly pay it forward ASAP.  Thank you for your generosity!
1	I had a few unexpected bills this past week and me and my 2 year old kiddo are running low on food. If anyone can help with a pizza i get paid thursday! Thanks very much :)  Edit : I'm in show low, az   Edit2: request fulfilled! Thanks to /u/thehopelesswanderer
0	I do get paid tomorrow but my kind of out of food until then. The last remnants of my cash was in my wallet which I misplaced at the pride parade on Tuesday.   To top off my lack of funds and food I already have to go through the painful and humiliating act of calling up my credit cards to have them cancelled, get a new drivers license/health card and much more =.=... Just down on my luck a bit and could use a pizza.  Thanks :].  Used a throwaway because I really would rather not have my friends/family know of my situation at the moment.. strange double standards I have I know. I won't get help from my friends or family but I'll ask strangers on the internet &gt;&lt;" I am willing to provide my actual account via pm :p
0	We've been eating noodles for two weeks now and I won't have any money until next Monday. If anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated!
1	Hey guys, hope everyone is having a nice Sunday.  Sure is beautiful here in NC.  I'll be honest, I'm starving :D  I've made it since Friday without food but desperate times call for desperate acts.  I get paid tomorrow and I'd be willing to trade some pizza today for some pizza tomorrow.  Very new to this subreddit but I could repay the sender with pizza tomorrow or provide for someone else in need.  Happy to verify with any information needed.      
0	I'll be sure to pay it forward! This month is just really hard because my roommates moved out right before rent is due and I had to buy a bunch of things to get by (they--a couple--took everything we originally split the cost of, so I have no dishes or utensils, cookware, etc.) until I find a place w/ my soon-to-be new roommates. And I don't make nearly enough at my minimum-wage job to afford rent by myself (college student!) so I already had to borrow $500 to cover part of my rent from my parents. They're really broke too.  Luckily I just got a second job and have been working my butt of at my current one, so once I'm well budgeted again, I'll be more than happy to pay the deed forward! 
0	Hey all. its about 4 in the afternoon here and i have yet to get any food into my stomach. There are a couple mismatched things in my pantry (canned green beans mostly), but i would love to have a real, solid meal. Thanks for considering my request!
0	Hey r/random_acts_of_pizza, none of my friends wanted to hang out so I'm just drinking by the pool, and would love a pizza zibbity zang to go with this shiner bock pudding pops! A zippity  boo dop
0	Today i just finished telling my Mum, dad and my Grandad that i am Transgender, and i will be starting to transition from Male to Female.   My mother was not okay with it. According to her now, i am disowned from the family, and can no longer speak to her, unless i say i am deciding to not transition.  My dad's reaction was so misinformed that i inadvertently lost my cool trying to explain it, where i was then met with a stern 'Get out until you figure out that you're not a tra*ny'.   My Mormon Grandad however, was not hostile, was not disagreeing, but merely said, "Whilst i do not understand it, i'm sure you can help me find out." He accepts what i'm doing and will not hold it against me, and will not treat me differently until i ask.   I think i figured out where i'm staying for the next few years whilst i finally start on my path to feeling better in myself.  does anyone wanna help round off one of my most difficult days ever, and buy me a pizza? It would seriously help me to calm down and take my mind off the massive dilemmas that have happened.  If you wish to see proof of anything, or just ask me any questions, please do below :)  I'm sorry if i've said anything offensive during this as well, no offense was intended!
0	I have a long shift today. And im hungry. 
0	This is obviously a throwaway. I've attempted to make a request before, but no one fulfilled it. I decided it would be wise to disclose a bit more about my situation, but I'm super embarrassed, hence the throwaway. If anyone offers, I'd be more than happy to message you via my regular reddit account. I've given and received before.   Things are looking pretty bleak for us, food-wise (thankfully, we're okay in other areas of our lives). It is literally just food. I'm embarrassed to say this, but we're at a point where we had to apply for food stamps. (I don't think there is anything wrong with food stamps or people who need them, I just never thought we'd be in this dire state of need.) I got all my verification turned in, but it is taking them so long to process it. I am hoping we get it before Thanksgiving, since their office will be closed from Thursday-Monday. I don't know what I'll do if they fail to complete processing my application before their Thanksgiving break. From the way things are going, it seems unlikely.  If anyone could send me a gift card for a pizza, I'd be so grateful. I'd pay it forward in anyway I can.   We couldn't pay our internet/phone bill. Thankfully, free wi-fi is only a short walk away. If you respond to this, please understand that I probably won't be able to respond to you until tomorrow morning. 
1	I heard about this a few days ago and decided to give it a try. Would anyone like to help out a broke job corps student?  I also promise to pay it forward as soon as I can. Thanks for anything. Update: thanks nmuir for the pizza.
0	And I heard all about this great subreddit...I thought "Hey!!! I like pizza too!!!"...Gimme a shout if you're willing to be generous. Thank You. Oh and btw I'm upstate NY.
0	On August 13, 2011 there was an oil fire in my two day old apartment. My boyfriend and I had just signed the lease and moved into the place. All we has with us was a skillit, some vegetable oil, and some celebratory Goya Empanadas. Hey, we are college students, eating healthy isn't our forte.    I put the oil on and asked him to keep an eye on it for me while I ran to the car to look for something. As I was doing that, he got an important phone call from work and forgot about the oil. I came in and the moment i shut the front door the oil spouted into a pillar of flame. Having nothing with us but the clothes on our backs, we had nothing to put out this oil fire with.    Instead of letting our new home burn my boyfriend decided to bravely pick up the flaming skillit and take it outside. When the front door opened the flames rushed up and licked over his head giving him a few minor burns. This caused him to jerk away and made the burning oil spill all over his right hand.   He had to be skin grafted from his fingertips to his elbows. He has had to wear pressure garments since the burns healed. It is a tight, itchy, and generally uncomfortable skin tight glove and sleeve that has bothered him everyday since. But he just smiles and endures.   He just called me to say that the doctor told him he didn't need to wear his pressure garments anymore! I want to celebrate with him with a pizza, but money is tight given the medical bills. Would anyone be willing to help me thank my hero?
1	I ran out of money on my meal card a while back, and finished the last of my easymac/sandwich stuff yesterday. Luckily for me the term is almost over, so I only need to survive for another week. A pizza would really help lighten that burden, and I could stretch it out to last. If you send anything my way, I'd love to write you a song telling you how awesome you are and record it.  Edit: As far as my music, I do orchestral/soundtrack like stuff, and some folk and jazz.
1	Lost my job about a year ago and have been unable to find one since. $23 is all I have left and I'm moving soon so I can't really spare all that much money.   Would anyone help out? I would pay it forward as soon as I'm able too because I love you guys.
0	Hi, I have a friend who is in need of help. He lives in Eau Claire, WI, and has just gotten to work for a long night shift. At the moment, he is extremely strapped for cash and hasn't been able to afford much food this week and doesn't get paid till the next. As a college student myself, I unfortunately am not able to send some cash his way right now. If any redditors could please help him out, I'd greatly appreciate it. 
1	I'm intimidated to ask for food like this, but my husband works five days a week to support the two of us and our puppy. He always does a great job managing bills, including our puppy, gas, etc. We try to buy enough groceries to last us the two weeks before pay-day and in between he gives plasma for extra cash.  This week he received a vacation for all of the days he's gone in early or when it was his day off and we've been waiting for Thursday (he gives plasma Thurs/Sat) for a night to finally have money for some good food.  On his way home from the Biolife center a few minutes ago he called me and said he was stuck at a gas station because he tried using the Biolife card to get gas. The pump automatically charges a card $75 dollars, I believe, and then puts back whatever you didn't use. My husband pulled the pump out to use it, realized the car was too far back, and put the pump back to pull the car forward. Somehow by doing that something got cancelled and the money is being withheld. When he called the card company they said it could be up to 7 days before it goes back into the account. My husband had to call his boss and ask if he could use the business card for $3 in gas to get home that he'd pay back Monday.  It would be so amazing if someone would provide us that awesome Thursday night we had planned. The favor *will* be returned by Saturday when he gives plasma again! We've never done this so if you're willing to walk us through how to go about receiving and then giving back when able it would be greatly appreciated!  **Edit**: We're in Texas! :)
0	Thanks, Redditors
0	My step dad just got laid off. We're spending the day together, and he's really down. We've had a tough year, to say the least. He's always been there for me. He married my mother knowing she had a daughter and has treated me as his own ever since. I was diagnosed with MS earlier this year and I wouldn't have been able to cope without him. We're hungry and broke, and I would love to make him smile with a pizza. He's a great person. I'm trying to restore his faith in humanity, essentially. Hope this works :)
0	Recently kicked out of my apartment that I was sharing with a friend, now staying at my parent's house but they are out of town for a while and have cleared out the house of any food until they get back. Would love some pizza to hold me over for a day or two!   In Scottsdale, Arizona if that means anything.  Thanks, love you all &lt;3 
0	Hi guys.  I feel embarrassed, but I'd like to humbly request some pizza assistance. I have -180 in my account until Friday, and it's all my fault. I paid rent twice this month by dropping off a check and then setting up bill pay online. I must have selected the wrong date, as March's rent was paid twice.   I've been fortunate to have friends who have chipped in with gas money or smoke for the last week, but my buddy's wife is probably wondering why I'm over so many nights for dinner.  One pizza would be dinner tonight, as well as lunch and dinner tomorrow until I wake up Friday to glorious pay day. I promise to pay this good deed forward, and I'm sorry again to be asking. 
0	I've managed to contract the flu (like the rest of this city). My boss sent me home this morning so no free work lunch for me. Been lurking reddit since I got home. Now I'm hungry.  Never requested RAoP, but it would be greatly appreciated, would also love to pay it forward!
0	I'm in my freshman year of college. I moved out to an apartment complex. I'm currently looking for a job. I ride a bike back and forth to school. I just really want some pizza and can't afford one right now! I live in the Gainesville area of Georgia.
0	I Just paid my unexceptedly High Teco bill that turned our grocery budge into a kool-aid and raman noodles budget. Pizza for me and my son would be greatly appreciated 
0	I just paid the last of my bills, and now have 3 dollars in my wallet. I wont be getting any more money for at least 5 more days, and currently have 2 packets of mac and cheese to eat. Not exactly sure what I'm going to do, my stomach is really starting to hurt from not eating. I feel pretty weird asking for food like this but I love this whole operation. I'd promise to pay it forward soon as I am able!  I'm in Westwood, CA...
0	so yea, thats basically it.  in between jobs, have literally -400 dollars in my account.  would love to be able to go pick up a pie for dinner.  any one feeling generous?
0	My family is grieving now over the loss of our dog, Ryan. My kids are  handling this as best as they can, but more than anything we could really all use a hug right now.   About two weeks ago, I came home to find Ryan walking into the wall. I picked him up to see if he would recognize me, but he wasn't his playful self. I rushed him to the vets, where he was kept overnight. The next evening I got the news that he needed to undergo liver shunt surgery. His surgery was scheduled for today, but he passed away overnight.  This little angel went through many bouts of going to the vets. Some  days he was bouncing around and playful, and some days he wouldn't do much of anything. I didn't think he could have been suffering from  something so serious.  I'm doing my best to be strong for my children, but Ryan was like one of the children. I haven't been able to do much of anything today, and I'm hoping someone out there would be willing to buy dinner for my family tonight. Outside of struggling to pay bills, we've now lost a member of our family.

0	My friends seem to doubt that this sub actually serves its purpose.  Prove it to me. PM me if interested. Also, I would love to kick back with a pizza and an Izze tonight.
1	How has my week been? Well I got paid on Thursday and after paying the mortgage and unexpected meds I have about $15-20 to last me the next 2 weeks after it all clears the bank.  So I am sitting here at work dreading going home to another bowl of ramen or a PB&amp;J. And while I don't really NEED a pizza tonight it would be nice.  I'm in West Texas btw. 
0	Girlfriend's out of town for the weekend, but even if she were here her car's busted, and we're both broke. So i'm just sitting here on Reddit, depressed and hungry. Pizza places don't open for a little bit here but if someone could help me out with a pie and a 2 liter you'd be my hero.  Edit: I'm an idiot and totally spaced on the location. Oh well. If anyone sees this and wants to take pity, i'm in Tempe AZ. I'd edit the title but dunno how.
0	I just bought 4 GBs of new RAM to make it run better, but it's still unplayable. I was looking forward to playing multiplayer with my brother. Needless to say, I'm pretty disappointed. I'm in Utah County.
0	My paycheck is late, as HR for my company is in NYC and still out of power. Won't come through for a few more days. I have enough ramen and cereal in the house to last me, but something hot and greasy would make my night. Thanks Reddit - I'll pay this forward as soon as the check clears!
0	We (myself and 4 kids) are out of food until I get paid on Friday and would love to have a pizza. I promise to pay it back right away when I get paid Friday!  One pie will be plenty for the 5 of us and we don't need toppings, just plain is great.  We have Oizza Hut &amp; Domino's near us. The kids  will eat breakfast &amp; lunch in school tomorrow and can share the big can of beefaroni tomorrow night.   This really isn't as serious as it sounds, I do work full time and will have a paycheck Friday, so we will not starve to death if nobody gets us a pizza tonight.  We're kind of used to it and at least have relief on Friday!  Thanks for reading :)  
0	My check from work has yet to come in. I only have about 66 cents in my bank account right now and the only thing I have to eat in my apartment is some mustard...very sad. Clearly I need to go get groceries, but until then could someone send me a pizza?? I would pay it forward eventually.
0	Pretty much as I said, pizza would be an awesome way to make this first week of school easier and there is no way I could possibly swing it. PM me if you are feeling awesome.  For my fellow students; good luck studying, we are already two days down. 
1	Ok, ready for the sob story? Got kicked out of an apartment and screwed out of my security deposit because the landlord's secretary made a mistake, my car broke down and then had two windows smashed, got robbed for a $700 financial aid check from school (gonna take six months to get it back now), and now the guy I did some painting for has just disappeared without paying me. So yeah, I'm broke and starving..staying at a friend's place in exchange for taking care of their pets. I've been living on my own since I was a teenager and I've never been in such a bad spot like this - made a throwaway because I'm honestly ashamed at the state my life is in right now.  The good news is that I just got hired somewhere, so in a few weeks when I get paid I'll pay it forward to someone else who's down on their luck. thanks in advance. 
1	I have been scared to ask for help. I lost my job in March, and money keeps getting tighter. I have a few interviews this week. So there is hope. I was wondering if anyone could help me this weekend? I will make sure to turn around and help when I get hired soon. 
0	Recently quit smoking weed to save on the expense. Can't remember the last time I spent money that wasn't groceries. Could use some pizza to eat my stress away :). Will pay it forward when I'm in a better place.
0	I have a starbucks gift card for $15 that I can send to someone via an e-gift through email on the starbucks website in exchange for you buying me a pizza.
1	Hi Reddit!   First off, I'd like to say I love this subreddit. I visit every now and again to see kindness toward strangers and it always makes me feel good ^_^ Even the supporters with upvotes make me smile. Keep it up, bros!   I'm asking for a pizza because I've moved to a new town recently and after a month of tedious job searching, I've finally managed to find a fulltime position (yay me!) but ... it took a month and I don't start working until tomorrow with my payday being at least a week away. If a kind stranger could throw some food my way, I'd be very appreciative!   In return, I give one of my favourite Internet reads  http://www.omegleconversations.com/urinate-in-catless-peace.html  and also my steam name: [eiramasil] and SC2 information [eira.506] because I'd love to be able to game with anyone who helps me out.   Thanks and have a great week ~
1	I got laid off from my job on December 12th unexpectedly, and have been struggling to get back on my feet ever since. Help with food for a night or two would be really appreciated for me and my SO since I couldnt spoil her like I wanted for christmas.  If nobody can help, I hope everyone has a wonderful day and good luck on all those New Years Resolutions!  Happy Belated New Years  
0	So... My roomates just left out to go food shopping. They both rely soley on food stamps for groceries. I'm out of work, they help me with food when they can. I am sure they will buy me something to eat (something I haven't had the luxury of doing as of yet today), but that won't be for some time... and I would really like to have something waiting for them to eat when they come back. I know it would make their day. I'm currently babysitting their kids who are getting a little ~~crazy~~ restless. I know food will be here eventually, so if you can give to someone who won't eat otherwise, please do. Barring that, it would really make my day and occupy the mouths of these rugrats lol.  Edit: All is well, food has arrived and smells delicious. crisis averted. no pizzas needed here. thank you for the time and consideration though.
0	Hi RAoP, my fiancée and I are both unemployed and are scraping along the moment with very little money. And since it is near the end of the month, we have even less.  It's a Saturday night and frankly we are starving! We don't have much/any food in the house we can eat, we live by ourselves and no family nearby that we can count on.  I know some people on here offer something small in exchange for the pizza (noticed one guy on here offered a rap xD), the only thing we can offer is really my fiancée might be able to do a little drawing for you (she's a good artist), or I can offer a spare copy of a game on Steam.  I know there are some good people out there on reddit and I hope one of them sees this.  I have 2 job interviews next week, if I get either of them, after my first pay I will come back on here and buy someone else in need a pizza. It's only fair.  Thank you and sorry for the slight wall of text.  Also, just in case, we are in the UK.
0	Hey guys, first post here. Thought someone would be cool enough to help me out when im down on my luck. Also open to trades. Dont have much but i can fit to work in my area if any manual labor is needed.
0	Hey Reddit. It's almost finals week and me and my roomate are studying hard. We've been living off of ramen for days now, and I would love to be able to get him something to eat that isn't salted noodles. If you could help we would appreciate it.   
0	How about a pizza to break the ice?
0	I have a boatload of tests this week and am hoping to use this weekend to finish my final projects and study a bit. I've hit a bit of a financial hiccup (http://imgur.com/Lw5wjsH), and am down to my last few dollars and a small bag of rice until sometime next week.   Any help would be greatly, greatly appreciated! Pizza lasts a few meals for me, and there is a cheap 5 dollar pizza place fairly close if any kind soul might be able to give me a hand. :) 
1	edit [Pizza Received] Thank you SaySheSaid2!    Hi. 35/f, love long walks on the beach, wishes for world peace, etc.      I'm about another month of being poor away from my goal weight but food would be awesome too. Not sure how this works. Just looking for a small pizza (I think that would probably get me a couple of meals) and maybe a soda? My concern though is that I don't have enough cash to tip the driver for delivery and I think carry out has ended. Do these deals work somehow with tip included? If not, I think I would rather pass than not tip.      I get paid Friday so hoping to pay it forward then.
0	I probably got a total of 2 hours of sleep last night due to my children being sick.  My husband is out of town so I cant sleep today.  I am exhausted and would not have to cook lunch.   Thanks.
0	Hey, my girlfriend has celiac disease and hasn't had a pizza in a long time. But today we found out that Domino's has gluten free pizza. I was wondering if anyone would be nice enough to order me one for her.  Thanks!
1	Thanks for reading my post. I have been struggling with money for quit some time now. My checking account is in the negative like $500, my house payment is due tomorrow and I don't have the $ to pay it. It would be nice to enjoy a pizza with my 11yo son tonight since I can't afford to do anything else with him. Thanks!!!
1	I've been lactose intolerant my entire life, and I just recently was given "Lactaid" pills (by recently, I just got back from the doctor's office) so that I can enjoy cheesy goodness (something I haven't done in 4 years.) Unfortunately, I'm a broke college student blah blah, you know the story. I'd really appreciate a pizza so I can thoroughly enjoy it :)  I live in the GTA area in Ontario, Canada. When I have some money to spare, I'm willing to pay it forward. And reddit, you can hold me to that :)
0	hello friends.. it's Thursday, I'm far from home, I miss my family, and I could use a pizza..  &lt;3 I love this "random acts of pizza"  how kind is that? 
0	Its been a while since I've been on a site where random people can get together and contribute something real.  I miss the days when Bots in a chat room (that most people goto irc doesn't count, those bots are friendly) were a minority, .   Myself and room mates do a lot of donation of our time and limited resources, helping those less fortunate that showed up at the Occupi.   When we have an abundance we try to make the trickle down thing work, but it is tough to do with food, preparing, freshness...  The local Z-Pizza is good.  1 roommate is vegetarian, and 1 is vegan.  They aren't the picky type they just take the meat of and give it to me.  Also if someone at the pizza place drew something funny on the box the we'd appreciate a good laugh. will post pix of pizza box.
0	Haven't worked in a couple weeks and won't have money for another 2 or 3 weeks. Really looking to have some pizza to share with my family.
0	Hi there! I don't have enough money to buy any pizza, and I'm really craving a pizza from Pizza Hut. Preferably pepperoni and cheese in the crust, but if you are nice enough to buy a pizza, it's really up to you.  Thanks in advance!
0	Not like a ton as an asinine prank, but a couple pizzas for serious as an olive branch of sorts.  I would but i'm broke.  **EDIT** - [Link for those confused about why I submitted this](http://i.imgur.com/Z5mpy.png)
1	  I've currently had a series of shitty things happen to me over the course of two weeks, and it's not been looking good atm.  This month has been pretty tough without finaid. I had to come up with rent from frantically borrowing from friends or get evicted from my apartment.  Leaving me with a negative balance in my account as of now and I would really love a hot meal.  
0	I have a part time job but Pizza Hut (ironic?) Corporate is forcing our store to give less and less hours; I only got around 13 this week. So any offers with pizza hut and I get a 20% discount (I think so, they took our 50% break discount so I don't know if I still get the 20% one). To see my girlfriend costs 150 dollars in gas to pick up and drop her off back at her house. Kinda want the cheesy bites pizza because my co-workers get pissed off every time someone orders one! XD Seriously though they are a huge pain to make...Oh! I also have to save all of my money because I may be homeless/living in my girlfriends closet soon... :(  EDIT: I should add today has been a really depressing day, and frozen chicken isn't exactly comfort food  EDIT2: I actually don't like pizza hut pizza all that much, at least not compared to dominos  Any pizza would be appreciated!
1	Times are really tough, I am a high-school chemistry teacher and dont know how much longer I will live. I just need to throw a pizza on my roof in frustration one more time before I die. Please help, also my son has a disability. Junior loves breakfast, but pizza will be fine. God bless.

0	Hi,  I am a computer tech representative.  We all know how bad this job can be if you have ever done it.  I am in a place where I have no money and they have failed to pay me recently due to a problem with the system.  I need a pizza to cheer me up and be able to take these calls today.  Please reddit help a fellow techie out by giving me a pizza.  Thanks tech in need.  Edit: I live in Austin, Texas
0	It's been a rough past few months, was down to my last 20 bucks again the other day, and had to buy dogfood, which in turn means I can't eat till Monday. A pizza would easily feed me thru the weekend. If anyone could help that'd be SO appreciated.
1	~~I've been broke since the middle of the month, with not even $5 in my account at the moment. I've got a little bit of food, but it's only enough ramen to feed one person here, and there is two (A relative). I've been wanting pizza for two months, but haven't really had the cash. As with most of the recent posts here, I'll get paid on Friday, and would gladly reimburse you after then. It's 8pm here, as of this post. My only local pizza place is Dominos.~~  ~~And hey, if you've got Steam, I can give you some trading cards I have left over, if that's your thing.~~  EDIT: I've been pizza'd!
0	[Request]Go to college at San Francisco State, live in SF, haven't eaten an actual meal in a few days, besides a few slices of bread. Please give me something to eat I get paid on the 15th :(
0	Title says it all.  Been reading this subreddit for a little while. Noticed some fun offers. What about fun requests?  I will either do whatever gets the most upvotes. Or if I can't, I will surrender, and let you pass the pizza on to someone else.  **Pizza sponsor CAN be different from the suggesters**  This could be fun.
1	The fiancé and I are short on rent and food. I just got a second job, but no pay check for two weeks. And he just started a third job that pays once a month. Please may we have our favorite food for dinner?
0	I've heard a lot about this subreddit from /r/trees and /r/assistance, but I have been relatively lucky up until now. I'm reaching out to this community! We're going to be a bit short for the next few days until I get paid again, and our pantry is bare and sorrowful.   If you want verification, just let me know! I'll be happy to provide pictures or an email verification.
0	It's my awesome birthday. Help a brother out plox?
0	i have recently been taken off government support due to a missed appointment. This was down to non receipt of payment (through no fault of my own) which then lead to me not being able to afford to make it to this appointment! I have re applied but this is going to take 3-4 weeks:( help me out please? thanks.
0	Hi I just moved to Waltham MA from my home state of PA and could use some comfort food on this very lonely day. Thank you!!
0	I dont have to much cash to go out and get something to eat and the fridge is bare since I dont go food shopping until tomorrow. If someone wants to help, you would have my love and gratitude. Thank you!
0	A pizza and hopefully a story about your life and how you're enjoying it. Just so I know that there are awesome times in life :)  I do live in Canada so I'm hoping that's not a problem.
0	Spent all afternoon out in the cold because my older sister got in a fender bender.  Mom had a tooth pulled and is in too much pain to make dinner.  
0	Ok so today is his birthday and we have no money to throw him a party or celebrate it. I am 17 and he just turned 21!!! We live with my dad but unfortunately he doesn't have any money either. I would really appreciate it if someone would gift him a pizza and I'm sure he would be delighted. Thanks for taking the tome to read this and if you decide to help me out then I will be grateful. I have no proof unless you want to add him on facebook. I live in Sugarland, Texas
0	I'm located in Madison, WI. I just spent the last money I had ($6.00) on food for my cat. I don't get paid again until the 18th, and at that time I will pay it forward. I would very much appreciate this. 
0	officially evicted today. have until tomorrow to pack up everything and leave. life sucks in general but a pizza would really cheer me up! Oh yeah i'm in canada.  have pics of eviction notice (sighs)
1	Me and my fiancee recently lost our home. We were paying rent but the landlord was not paying the mortgage. As a result we had no where to go. We ended up having to stay in a motel untill we can find a new place. After the room is paid for the week and the car is gassed up so My fiancee can go to work just to pay for this room, There is close to nothing left. I have found work recently, but do not start for another 3 weeks. We basically live off of what food will fit in a mini- fridge. With morale being low right now, I think a hot pizza would lift spirits. There is nothing more soothing then some hot comfort food!  And in the next few weeks I plan to buy someone a pizza myself. ... Pay it forward they say!
0	Hello, I've been a longtime lurker on reddit and finally made an account a few weeks back.. since then my life has absolutely been turned upside down.   After this semester [full time] at university I lost my job. I had barely paid off this semester via payment plan when I received the VOICEMAIL informing me I was no longer needed at work.   The issues created by not having money for my bills and gas caused major problems with my parents, who had been letting me live at home this last semester on the condition I would finish my degree and sustain myself financially regarding everything but the roof over my head. Needless to say, they do not really have the means to support another person and I left because of this strain.  I have been couch crashing this last week at a friends' with literally nothing to offer him (or his awesome, understanding roommates who I really just met) in return for their hospitality. A PIZZA!! =) to share with these great people would not only be the first whole meal I have had for a while, but it would go a long way towards making me feel a bit better about myself for actually contributing to this house a bit. The other folks here are all struggling students, and looking in the pantry all I'm seeing is ramen and potatoes (lol).   Thanks for putting up with this wall of text, I felt obligated to give the whole story! Not sure of what evidence is necessary but needless to say if you ask for it I will provide. I hope I did this right (got a confirmation code as well if needed) but here goes heh. Take care!  EDIT! we are in Albuquerque, NM, USA 87114. Thanks chupanibre25 =)
0	Sorry about the throw-away account, but my fiance reads Reddit as well.  Currently he's strapped for cash and is just making his rent and bills. He has a job lined up and will start in September. Currently he is living off rice and taco bell sauce packets.   I just want to make his Friday night/weekend just a little bit better.   If you could help at all, it would be much appreciated.  
0	I'm in southwestern Michigan, and I've kinda lost all hope in this situation. My buddy and I haven't had anything to eat for a while now and I don't think we can afford to. If anyone could help I would really appreciate it, we ran out of Raman noodles a couple days ago and don't know what to do... Our finances are even screwed for this next month completely, I need some little beacon of light and a pizza would go a long way right now.
0	Hey all, with mom overseas working as a translator for the military the fridge at our house maintains a steady rate of being... 20% full, so there's not really much of anything edible in my house outside of oatmeal and canned soup. I do really miss moms home cooking but shit, at this point, this far deep into the void that is Finals week, I'll take anything that has substance in order to keep me moving, haha.  Much love.
0	I'm not complaining, she's great and gets me eating really healthy. I'm pretty much vegan most of the time, at the very least vegetarian, though I eat seafood regularly and chicken or other meat on occasion. But right now, I'm broke and everything in the house is vegan.  I've made some badass vegan pizzas in the past but the cheese, although it melts, just isn't the same.  I'm working on a crossbow-wizard that imbues his spells in crossbow bolts to fire at enemies.  Also, I don't drive, but there's a Dominoes and a Papa Johns that deliver to my house.  There's also a local place but I dunno how RAOP could handle that.  If any verification is needed, I'll do whatever is needed. Check my posting history, you'll see everything I say is true.
1	The bike was chillin' on my back patio behind TWO gates, where I thought it would be fine. I just moved into this place last month to be closer to work... and a week later I got laid off.  My faith in humanity needs restoration, pronto! One little random act of pizza may not seem like much, but it could make all of the difference. 
0	Hi everyone I am in Louisville ky and I have a wonderful 6 yr old daughter and we are down to almost nothing in are fridge and I dont get paid until tomorrow and I was wondering if anyone would please help us .So please if anyone could please help us out with dinner for tonight we would really appriciate it thanks..
0	Hello everyone! We are a family of 4 and we are completely out of food for the rest of the month. Is there anyway at all that someone could help us out with egift card to Dominos for today? That way we can at least have something to eat today and try to figure something else out for the rest of the week. We havent had any luck coming up with anything for today. It would mean alot to us. 
0	currently living in my car with my 55 year old mother and 2 dogs. We both lost our jobs in 08 and we moved from Toronto to Vancouver after trying to survive out east for work it was hit and miss, so we sold what we had and drove across canada. I just recently got a good job out here in Vancouver and hoping to get a place for Nov 1st. But we are out of food and gas as I'm waiting for my check on the 15th but we are all starving a random act of pizza would greatly lift our spirits.   **UPDATE**  Thanks for those that reached out to us the community centre closed at 9 near us which had the internet, but some guy outside noticed us shuffling things around in the car getting ready for bed and came over to us to talk, at first we were a bit freaked out but the guy was nice and gave us 40 bucks to get some grub and gas, I still didn't get that pizza cause the safeway was the closest place but hey maybe on my pay day on the 15th!! thanks again for all that responded and offered help
1	don't get my check until tuesday evening, a pizza or 2 plus the food we have left here should last til then when im able to get groceries. id ask my parents but i dont want them knowin im in this shitty situation. im goin back to school in the fall so hopefully that will open up more opportunities for us. if someone is fortunate enough to lend some help, id be ecstatic and my son, most importantly, would definitely be as well. message me for verification!!
1	EDIT: There was a change of plans and I am leaving tonight, so I no longer need a pizza. I'll just eat when I get home.   I posted yesterday under r/randomactsofpizza yesterday because I didn't know about this one before hand  I'm over in Port Orchard, WA dog sitting for some people, and I was under the impression they were going to leave me some food to eat. They aren't coming back until very late tonight and until then I don't have many options until they pay me.  What I can offer is a picture of me, the dog, and the pizza as soon as I get home on Tuesday.  A pepperoni pizza would be a great lunch and dinner for me, and I would really appreciate one. Danke danke sehr.   Lindsey
0	I can give you $25 dollar iTunes card ,I'm super hungry and would love some pizza. thanks edit in Nebraska
0	Help I'm hungry!!
0	Me and my girl are doing a Juice Fast. You can see my daily entries and workouts at www.juiceoverjunk.com. We have only had Juice and Water for the last 24 days, We started June 1st and will be ending June 30th. We will then be having Vegetables and fruit for the next 15 days to break the fast properly, working our way to solid foods. We have enough money for Pizza, but I was wondering if anyone wanted to treat us and be the person to give us our first Pizza / order out since the fast. That would be sometime around mid July. Sorry if I am doing this wrong. I just been lurking in this subreddit for some time, and thinking pizza this whole month. It would really be cool to participate.  We are in Middle River, Maryland btw.  Thanks in advance all.
0	I'm not really sure how this works. What I need to tell you and such. I went out of the country last year, spent all my money, moved back into my old house with my roommate. But ever since I've had the hardest time getting back on top of my money. I had 2 jobs, but I decided recently to quit one and just move back in with my parents. I've got about 2 weeks left in this house, me and my friend who also doesn't have anywhere to stay live in this room. So now all my money goes towards paying off past due bills and people I owe money too, all Ive got in the kitchen its canned soup and fruit. Which is food, but its almost worse than eating ramen everyday, like a awful liquid diet.  But whatever, I'm not gonna complain. I thought I'd see if theres anyone who'd like to share a pizza with me and my roommate sometime? Where located in Memphis. I suppose you PM me for the rest of the details.
0	I got back from break about a week ago, and have been surviving off canned and frozen foods. I'm kinda sick of it, and would humbly ask for a pizza! thank you
0	I am tired of ramen and anything that comes out of can. I'm really hoping someone can hook me up, because I only have a dollar to my name. I wasn't able to budget well this past month as I had to get my car repaired. $558.00 for repair took what was left of my check and cleared out my savings. I am broke till next Friday and desperately hoping for some pizza. I live in Frankfort, NY. Thank you for reading.
0	 Please help. You're my only hope.  I live in Asheville, North Carolina. No work, no food. Got a job interview tomorrow, will pay it forward once a paycheck comes in,
1	Ive been unemployed for over a month, and have actively been looking for a new job to no avail, and well, as such I dont have food (no really I dont mean all I have is Ramen kind of no food, because well, even Ramen costs too much) and me and my roommate are starved as our other three roommates try to preach live together die alone and then only take care of themselves. So Im here today Random Acts of Pizza to ask for some help, Id literally sell my soul for some coffee and pizza. I understand if theres someone who would need it more for instance people with children, in fact  I ask you pizza them first, but I would greatly appreciate a Pie &lt;3
1	Wow this is so amazing! Maybe reddit can help me out? I've been unemployed for three weeks. I applied for unemployment when I was dismissed from my last job at a restaurant. I had been working there for six months since it opened and it changed everything for me. I was on the verge of getting evicted when they hired me and I was able to turn that whole situation around because they took a chance on me. Now I'm more confident that even though I had been fired I immediately went out there to find more work. And even though I haven't been able to find more than a few temporary assignments I'm not discouraged about it.  However I am not living so comfortably. I had been living very much month to month. And I was able to pay June rent I don't have much left for food. Since I had been working at a restaurant I just ate for free there. Now I applied for food stamps in California but am not able to get an interview for benefits until after the 4th of July weekend. I showed up to the office and waited all day only to tell me that I can't do anything until that interview.  I've been paying for my food with change I find around the house. My unemployment check won't come until they do a phone interview on Friday with me. I won't have any money after I pay July's rent. And I definitely won't be able to pay utilities without the unemployment check. I don't want to seem like begging but I would pay it forward if you could help a fella out reddit.
0	Wednesday: Moved out of my house, marriage in shambles.  Friday: In the ER with kidney stones. Intense amounts of pain.  Saturday: Missed my sister-in-law's wedding due to both previous events.  Monday: Reamed by my boss for shabby work, given this week to work on it.  Today: Oh crap it's Wednesday already. A long evening of work awaits.  If anyone wants to order me an [Austin's Pizza](http://www.austinspizza.com/menu.php) (the Redditor, of course) then it would add a little bright spot to my week. My friend, who's offering his couch rent-free, would appreciate the free grub as well.   PM me if you're willing, no hard feelings if you're not.
0	Well, it's my first time on this subreddit, and I wish I was giving.  Unfortunately though I was able to pay off my rent, I don't have any money until Friday to buy groceries or anything similar.  It would really help me out if I could get some pizza to munch on while studying tonight.  Thanks if you can. Have a great upcoming Thankgiving everyone!
0	I live with my mom, sister, uncle, aunt, and grandmother. Our water was cut off a couple days ago due to financial reasons. Plus, our family has no form of transportation and we live in rural North Carolina so there is basically no public transportation and we have a hard time getting to stores to get food. We have been living off ramen and sandwiches for a couple weeks now we all need some sort of break. Since I live somewhat far away from other Redditors so any type of egift card would be great. For some reason just about all of our utilities are cut off except for power and internet/phone. I'm sure that any type of help would be greatly appreciated. I'm not exactly sure how to verify my story because of limited resources but if you have an easy way to verify than say. Thanks
0	It's been a while actually, I almost have gotten over food until I found a packet of Walkers crisps the other day, not my flavour but I wasn't complaining at all. It only made it worse frankly and I wish I had rationed them. No more money left right now.  Student Finance have been fucking me around and so far the only substance that is going into me is water and tea (with sugar and milk)  I would happily repay this favor to the kind individual in the coming future when I have received my Student Finance loan.  Right now I'm running out of options in terms of food.
1	I thought I had planned a bit better for my family, but I wasn't able to stretch this last check as far. The wife and I have been fighting to pay medical bills with no end in sight. My wife has been in remission from cancer for 3 months. We're both staying hopeful that she have defeated this. I don't know what I would do if I lost my wife. She has been the love of my life for 15 years and we are still going strong. I feel that I've let her down as a man because we have never gone without food. This is probably one of the lowest moments of my life, but I have to ask for help. I asked my brother if he could loan me a little cash until Friday but he's in just as bad of a situation as I am. I found a food pantry but it's too far away and no one at this location was willing to meet me halfway. I am hoping that someone out there can help my family and I. Please consider us. Thank you.
1	Hey Reddit,  Basically, I've had to pay out £50 in taxi fees to get to hospital in the last week, which has been almost my entire budget for the week. A pizza tonight would really take the edge off.  All the best, stordoff
0	I would love to brighten up my husbands' day with a pizza(his favorite food). He works so hard for us (2 kids under 2 and me, the wife) and we just learned that he lost his job today. I promise to give back as soon as my husband gets another job (Hopefully soon as the staffing agency told him they will email him about another job).
0	So yeah, new to this sub-reddit.. Jobless and alone for turkey day.. I don't even know if they are open on thanksgiving.. probably not right? Anyway, I'm in North Mankato, MN.. if anyone would like to help, I would really appreciate it, and hopefully in about a month, I'll be able to pay back, or even help out another reddit-or..   Thanks for reading, hope you all have a happy holiday, even if you don't celebrate :) 
0	we have used all of our food money for a month because me and my brother and friend just finished remodeling my brothers room because his room was ugly looking hahahah. and we dont get paid till monday and we were just wondering if any of you noble people of RAOP will give us something that will feed 3 hungry people! thank you :] if you are interested i will give you 3 dollars on the psn store for exchange.
0	My girlfriend and I are going through some really hard times financially. Rent is due tomorrow, and we're still two hundred dollars short. There's no food left in the cupboards, and every single cent we own needs to go to rent.   Times are really hard. I don't think we've ever been this stressed out before, and I don't think I've ever had this many panic attacks. I am unemployed, and despite the hundreds and hundreds of applications I filled out, I remain without an income. She works hard to support us both through these hard times, but I can tell it's really wearing down on her. We went to bed without dinner last night, and I woke up to the sound of her softly sobbing into the pillow.  I don't have much to offer in return, but we can work something out. I'm a writer, maybe you need a report written or something? I own essays. I'm like Will Ferrel in Undeclared.  I need a pizza not only because we need to eat, but because I need to be reminded that we haven't bottomed out, and that things will get better. I'm losing hope, fast.   We live in Portland, OR.
0	Haven't eaten anything these last two days hoping Reddit can help!
1	[I've made a diagram for you-all of what I'd like to happen.](http://i.imgur.com/yKjmh.png)  I have no sad story to woo you all with, simply that I am raiding on Warcraft without pizza--which I'm pretty sure is right after the holocaust on the tragedy scale.
1	Well, I haven't eaten since yesterday when I ran out of food. So here is to hoping that today will be different. I live in Florida would really appreciate a pizza or gift card.   Thanks  
0	Hi Reddit.  I hate asking for charity. But it's been a rough couple of weeks. I have no money for the next couple of days, no way of earning more that quickly, and not much food bar some baked beans in the fridge.  On top of that, I'm ill. Not Beastie Boys ill, 'all my joints hurt and my hands won't stop shaking, I hate flu' ill. I should emphasise that I'm not starving, though. It's not 'please send me pizza, I have nothing to eat', it's 'please send me pizza, I don't want to have to eat the same terrible cheap food for the next couple of days'.  And it is written, man cannot live on beans alone, so I was hoping one of you might be generous enough to help me out. The full sob story's available on request if you're interested, plus pictures or whatever verification. Thanks for reading.
0	I have no money and would love a pizza  if anyone could help i will pay it back when i can ASAP
1	I hope it's okay to request on behalf of others. My friend in Aberystwyth has several thousand words to write tonight, but she's got no money, ran out of rice and lentils yesterday, and doesn't get her student loan until tomorrow.  I'd buy her something myself but I'm also out of money, and I live in Cardiff so I can't bring her food.  She'd be very grateful for a pizza, and I'll pay it forward when I can.
0	Asking for this favor so I can pass it along as well in the future. Just really hungry and tired
1	I've been incredibly broke the last couple of weeks, even had to bounce a $25 check last week to get some food. I've been without food for the last two days and I get paid Friday (finally!). Ugh. Please help me out!  My fridge! http://i.imgur.com/bL8RO.jpg, http://i.imgur.com/QrGgL.jpg
0	I'm a stay at home mom with my 2 year old son. I have a boyfriend that works 12 hours a week for basically nothing half the time. He's having a hard time keeping food on the table. I wouldn't ask if I really didn't need it. But I have warn the supply I had in my cabinets down to nothing. I just need a little help please. I will give you any proof you need. I will even pay it forward some how when I can. Thank you for reading.  [EDIT] My boyfriend made enough money last night to buy us some groceries for a few days. So as much as I appreciate you guys offering I no longer need it. I couldn't in good conscious take a pizza I dont really need. Specially since there are so many people on here that need food. Thank you so much for offering, it really makes me smile that their are some awesome people out there willing to help a stranger. I hope that if I ever need help again that I will be as lucky to find people with hearts like yours! &lt;3
0	morning out there my family is hoping for pizza tonight but the wallet is empty its been over six months since had pizza or have even gotten to go out to eat. please can anybody help my family have a pizza dinner tonight
0	I'm super hungry and have no monies at all. A pizza would be greatly appreciated. 
0	My roommate's wife is gone for the first time and their infant son will not take the bottle.  He's been screaming for the last hour, and neither of us have the wherewithal to cook or the cash for delivery.  Please help.  Edit: Withdrawn!  My friend is cooking dinner for us.
0	So I just moved out to Denver for a job that I then lost (was hard working with some of the other employees, and the company was going in a bad design direction).  I was lucky enough to get another job within a week but i'm now between paychecks.  I have $100 on the Envato Market place I can exchange for pizza.  I'll double the cost of the pizza in return.      If you don't know about Envato, they run these amazing sites:     http://themeforest.net/ - Really nice website and wordpress themes.     http://codecanyon.net/  - PHP scripts/classes and WordPress plugins, jQuery and Javascript stuff.     http://audiojungle.net/ - Music and sound fx for movie or game production.       http://videohive.net/   - After Effects projects scenes and other video assets.     among others you can navigate to from any of their sites.   I make money selling items on CodeCanyon but they pay out on the 15th once a month.  I'll purchase any item or items you want up to around $60 ( so around $30 in pizza ), how much is up to you.   I would much rather have pizza than hamburger helper without any hamberger (hamberger is expensive you know).
0	First time asker, long time lurker.  My roommate gets off work in a few hours and we plan to marathon s2 of game of thrones. Surprising him with pizza, and feeding myself of course, would be the best thing ever! We haven't been able to afford much food lately since he is now unable to sell plasma after a complication last time, so we're always a bit hungry.   Thanks so much in advance!
0	I spend a lot of time between NYC and Washington, DC. Spring break is officially started and my usual arrangements are all in a worst case scenario kinda way, exhausted. My parents are out of the country, my fiancé is on a ship, phoneless and I am here very hungry. Ask me anything you want to verify! 
0	Recently graduated into a terrible jobs market.  Trying to make by with odd jobs but I've ended up hungry today.  Trying to help my bi-polar mother as well.  She's on disability and often has to chose between food and rent.    Pizza would be appreciated by both of us.  My verification code is:  2FCT4EUT786l  I'm fairly certain Dominos is the only place that delivers to my home.  I would *really* appreciate some help.  I plan on giving once I find a real job.  
0	My boyfriend had to go to the ER a few days ago and I got behind on laundry so I'm already going to have to turn on the dryer and heat the house up more. We have a portable AC in one room but it's working hard today and I'm still rather miserable. I also had my first encounter with morning sickness this morning and I hate touching/looking/smelling raw meat lately so a nice pizza that I dont have to turn the oven on for sounds so great right now. Thanks for reading/considering!
0	Ok I'd like some pizza and thought maybe I could entertain some people to get some.  Hell even if I don't get pizza I'll entertain XD  So make a root comment, with a few topics you want involved, and I'll begin an interactive adventure with you!! 
1	ive asked yesterday and got nothing and i just need something for today for dinner im willing to pizza it forward 
0	I'm a swole man needing some pizza, I am willing to eat pizza live via skype while flexing my giant biceps
0	No money until next friday : (
1	Not sure if this is the purpose of this reddit. Please excuse the new account, I saw this on the news, what an amazing idea!  I am currently living with a roommate who has just moved out of her mother's house, she has no job and her mother sends her utility and rent money. Her only responsibility is to send her mom the rent bill, and she sends half of that or pays half to the company. The problem is that this girl is SO lazy, can't be bothered to send the bills, can't be bothered to call her mom for rent and I'm under the impression she told her mom she already had a job (her mom has been chiding her for not having a job), so her mother does not feel obligated to pay this girl's bills. I have been carrying the weight of the major bills, such as electricity and rent (2x), and my paycheck is being stretched thin. To top it off, it's obvious to see where she gets her flaky attitude from...her mother REFUSES to answer my phone calls or emails. So here I am reddit, living with a girl who labels her food in the fridge so I don't touch it, and for the sake of keeping the peace...I am down to begging for a pizza X(.  I would prefer giftcards, because I would rather give out my email address than my physical address, but I will understand those who dont want to in case they believe I am a scammer.   My email address is: Jen.Beam.1984@gmail.com
0	Hey guys, I haven't quite gotten on my feet (i.e. found employment) after spending the summer on the road before my band broke up a couple months ago.  I'm sitting in an empty apartment with a laptop and a can of cream of shrimp soup.  (Oh ramen, how I miss you.)   SOOOOO, if someone would be kind enough to help me out with a delicious pizza, I'd be more than happy to write and record a little ditty thanking them.  Not that that's worth much, but...it'd be fun?
0	My 20th birthday was the 14th (Of may) and I was Kicked out of my place (I had just been laid off). Since then I have moved in with a family member, but we are out of food (He is on food stamps, I am in the process of getting them and getting unemployment while I find a new job). Today his car broke down so we are having trouble trying to hit up the local food pantry, we have some food in the house but I would love to surprise him with a pizza pie for dinner tonight.  Willing to provide any proof needed. Will be able to return the favor at the end of June (Should have my unemployment by then)
0	Hi I'm shmuel. I know I just joined Reddit but I in real need here. Just moved across the county to Portland Oregon. I lost my bank card and I don't have anything to eat!  Please help nee out. I now know what it means to go hungry! 
1	I'm currently moving and all my food/cookware is packed and gone already. The security deposit I was told and counting on getting back today is not coming, landlord claims damages from a storm we had last year. *sigh* So I have no money for anything except the gas to drive me to my new place tomorrow night. I feel so selfish posting here when maybe there are others it would better benefit, but a pizza would certainly be welcome here today. Thanks reddit.
0	So broke:(I'm from vista,CA moving to Boston in about a week, but I seriously have no money and have to figure out how I'm gonna get by until then. I don't really have any friends to help me out otherwise I wouldn't be so flipping hungry!!!      I hate asking favors but if there's anyone out there who could help a brother out, I would be eternally grateful! As a sign of good faith I will even make an art piece dedicated to my pizza 
0	I'd love a pizza for my birthday. I'm not going out anywhere and I have my two children who'd like some too. I don't have a car and the only place that delivers is Dominos. Thank you for reading, even if you can't donate! 
0	I haven't drawn anything lately and we're broke until Friday. [Here's my deviantART gallery](http://androidar.deviantart.com/gallery/) so you can see my skill and what I usually draw. All characters and species of my own creation (minus the Ponies of course). I can do sketches and I'm pretty fantastic with MS Paint, if I do say so myself.  I will draw something for someone in exchange for a yummy warm pizza for the 3 of us (Fiancee, son and myself).  If someone is feeling more than generous in their pizza giving (more than one pizza, extra tasties), I will have my talented fiancee bring life and colour to the sketch. She's awesome.  Thank you.
0	Hey all,  It's been nice reading some of the stories on here, Didn't think I would ever contribute one of my own but here goes. Basically long story short I lost my wallet last weekend and had to cancel all my cards,  I'm an international student here a couple of thousand miles from home while not entirely on my own I've been making do with the 20euros I had in my pocket since Friday. I was hoping I might get a new card today it never came and now I'm looking at recycling some empty bottles so I can buy some bread for the evening. If someone fancied the challenge of ordering pizza on a Finnish website I would be forever grateful as I really don't want to go asking friends for some spare dinner on Valentines day. 
0	 My sister and I haven't had a decent meal for the past 2 weeks due to our sick parents who lives in the Philippines. We've been sending them money to get the medicine they need. However, we're in a very desperate time in our lives and we really need a decent meal.   Btw : We live in CT.  We are willing to pay it forward as soon as we get a chance.
1	I love pizza. I don't have enough money in my bank account to order one. I'm really hungry. I don't have a car, so I can't go get pizza in person. PAPA JOHNS IS FAR AWAY, IN BALTIMORE.   BALTIMORE. I love Pizza. Pizza is my favorite food. I am alone tonight and PIZZA WOULD BE SO WARM AND LOVING.  If anyone would be so gracious, I would pass down the warm pizza giving when I have available funds. I can also send pictures of the pizza in my hands, mouth, and while I am doing homework.
0	The title pretty much says it, if you need verification, or more info or anything else please PM me. I messed up once and I'm hoping on going on a 'Highventure' to make things better than they were before I lost her.  Oh and BTW, she's leaving to college real soon so I'm a little worried having all this pressure and whatnot. If you have any ideas on having a memorable Entventure please do tell. Thank you.
0	Hi!, I'm from around the GTA in Ontario, Canada- I was recommended by a internet friend that I could maybe receive a pizza here..  My fridge broke down about a week plus ago ( I live in an apartment complex )  Anyways, I found this out much later than I should have.. and all my food spoiled. It's near the end of the month, and I wasn't prepared to face this type of problem.. Only have a $1.46 in my bank account right now, and I'm trying to tide over with a can of beans and an expired bag of popcorn until the 1st of next month hits..  Anyways, thanks for reading my thing; and I hope you have a good day!
1	Would be really great to have something other than noodles tonight! A pie would go great this Friday night and some gaming. No sad story here, just college student on a budget!  Thanks all!  Edit: Sorry, Location: Dekalb, IL
0	 I'm tired and just got family from Venezuela in today. We have nothing to eat, my grandma doesn't speak english nor is able to drive. My mom is studying for a crutial college exam and won't be back till around 9pm. I highly doubt that she'll like me doing this but I have nO money. In short, can anyone send a large cheese Pizza tO me?
0	No pitiful sob story here; I have a paypal account with enough money in it to buy pizza, however, Domino's doesn't accept paypal in the US and I don't have any other money. I'll gladly repay the cost of the pizza once it arrives at my door. PM me for order and address and whatever else you need.  Thanks in advance, RAoP!
0	Now, I'm not a poor guy. My family makes money, we live well. However. My family has recently been on a healthy food kick. I'm all for eating healthy, but I like to indulge every once in a while. They're not a fan of doing that. I'd go to the store and get something, but whoops no license. I'd order a pizza, but I have about ten bucks to my name and I have plans for that money. So just PM me if you want to send a pizza to a guy in central Florida. 
0	it's been a busy busy term and i haven't been able to find a part-time job so the groceries have stretching since september and i just can't afford to get out to the grocery store right now. my cupboards hold nothing but an almost empty bag of pasta and my fridge just a can of tomato sauce. I need to do a lot of work this week, but I just can't concentrate due to weakness. Help me please and I promise to pay it forward.   edit: i live in victoria, bc. 
0	I have two friends who are on hard times right now. They just moved and are living paycheck to paycheck. They've had to go without food for a few days now, and I hate to see them like this and not be able to do anything about it myself (Since I'm also scraping by). Any help would be appreciated. I'd love to be able to tell them food is on its way.
1	I posted last night, but perhaps it was a bit too late in the evening? I have zero funds, no food to speak of, and I've been hungry for days now. I was in a car accident a week ago and life has been pretty crummy as of late. I know this is a long shot, but anyone feel like helping out?  EDIT: Thanks pandyfackerlling!
0	went broke 2 days ago (Rent, school loans). I  dont get paid until another week if anyone out there in SF can help with a nice pepperoni pie you would be praised with my thoughts for ever!, never really done this before kinda feel a bit shameful for asking, will gladly return the favor. idk if it matters im in north beach area. Thanks for those who read this.
0	Like it says, today is the last day of my vacation. Would love a stuffed crust pepperoni pizza. I'm in Northern Virginia. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
0	havnt had pizza since my friends birthday and all a sudden i am really craving for some pizza  Surrey,BC
1	well it's my best friends birthday party at my apartment tonight and I'm too broke to get a pizza. this is worth a shot I suppose. Have a wonderful night everyone
1	Living in SD, USA. Money is really tight with my fiance and I and while we have cheap boxed dinner food it would be much appreciated to be able to offer her something more substantial to eat since she's 7 months pregnant. If anybody is feeling generous we would be eternally thankful!   EDIT: Fulfilled by pizzamom thank you so much!
0	The last week has been very tumultuous, at least by my standards. I had to deal with writing several papers for school while treating head lice, the water and internet being shut off, and very little patience. Life has certainly picked up a bit.  The water has been turned back on, the head lice has been treated, but I'm still stuck writing several papers, babysitting, and working with a limited food supply. I'm not trying to create a sob story, it's just how things are at the moment. I do plan on giving pizza in the future when I am able. Heck maybe I could even give back to you.  My roommate's daughter is at the sitters for the night, we're getting ready to watch some really bad movies while I work on some papers. We'd like to celebrate the fact that she just gained employment and passed a test. Please help me out so I don't have to live off of one box of rice and a very limited supply of coffee.  
1	My boyfriend's mom has been hinting at the fact that she would like to have a lap dog to keep her company.  Boyfriend and I find the perfect one and spend the last of our cash for the week to get it We. bring it over to surprise her with it and her controlling boyfriend says she can't have the dog because he didn't get her for it.  So now we have a sweet new puppy to find a home for, and no money.  Not to mention that my boyfriend is devastated by this (he doesn't know I am posting).  Pizza would help boost his crushed spirit.  TL:DR Tried to surprise boyfriend's mom with dog she wanted, got denied by her controlling boyfriend. Boyfriend devastated.
0	From Miami, I know not too far, but had to come to Orlando for a certification course. Put hotel money and course money up front and will be reimbursed by my company either this week or next but all the expenses broke me and I left my emergency credit card at home. Anything would help and would definitely pay it forward in the coming weeks. Thanks! 
0	I just bailed a childhood friend out of jail today. He had been getting mixed up in drugs, and honestly, I hadn't spoken to him in about a year. But I never stopped caring about him. He got pulled over, and cops found a bag of weed. He got arrested and no one else, even his family, came to get him out. Cost me around $1000 to release him... Im dry with money now and could use a a pizza... I of course would pass along the generosity 
0	I was up until 7am coding a website, had to wake up at 8:30am, resumed coding until 12pm, a friend smoked me down, came down around 3pm, but I couldn't go to class because I was way too tired. I'm now starving and can't go home for another hour and a half. :( Then it's another hour before I get home.  Anyway, I'll do something for a pizza, if you tell me what you want. :)  That something could include an Amazon purchase for you of up to $10.28. I have $10.28 stuck in an MTurk account, which I can transfer to a gift card balance and purchase something if you'd like. I don't have a bank account to withdraw it myself. I believe I can turn it into an [online gift card to Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/gc/order/ref=gc_dp_conv_order?ie=UTF8&amp;casin=B004LLIKVU&amp;type=Email&amp;design=a_generic_white_10_us), if you want $10.28 in Amazon credit for some pizza. :)  **EDIT**: Turns out I can not turn it into an Amazon gift card. If you'd like me to purchase something for you though, I will. I can't purchase digital downloads, gift cards, subscribe &amp; save, or Amazon Prime according to the Amazon help.
1	with pizza.  ehh??   Watching Star Trek with the person i'm going to marry, have both been up for 24 hours, and are getting really sick of oatmeal... haha so if anyone has a spare pizza laying around we'd be much obliged...the end. 
0	It is me and my girlfriend's anniversary today, later tonight actually, and I kinda want to do something nice for her like a pizza dinner. Problem is, I am unemployed at the moment, so I can't really afford much besides rent. I've been tryin like crazy to get one or two of those avoid the noid cards, but no luck and today is the last day.  Could anyone help me out? Either with a pizza or a gift card? Or just well wishes. 
0	Hi RAOP'ers!  I go to school part time and work full time.  My night class doesn't interfere with my work hours but my daytime class is in the next town over.  Since I work full time and my daytime class takes up a few hours on 2 days of my 8-5 schedule, I use my lunch hours to go to class.  That leaves me with no way to leave work to get anything or go home to fix lunch (which is all I can afford atm :).    So dumb poor me left the house this morning with no food for lunch and I can't afford to order anything.  Any pie for poor forgetful me? :)
0	Like title says, any pizza :D
0	It took me some time to figure out where to make this post. My friend Mary has received pizza from here, and told me this is where I should post. I worked with her husband at a distribution center that has closed down, and I am at the point between choosing buying medicine and buying food. I was diagnosed with CHF congestive heart failure and underwent triple bypass surgery last year. Going without my medication is not an option and I'm willing to provide pictures of my empty and nearly empty pill bottles. My son is going to help me with food when he gets paid on the 17th, but I really can't go another night without eating. 
0	I'm an Engineering student, not a Performing Arts student, so I can't make up a compelling back story for why I want a pizza.  I'm hungry, I have no money after Black Friday and something greasy and cheesy sounds awesome right now.  Im not in dire straights to feed my starving children ( I have no children I'm only 22) nor have I been fasting on Taco Bell hot sauce for the past week, I just really want a pizza.  If someone feels like helping me out that would be awesome and after I get my internship over the winter season I promise to pay it forward to someone.
0	Would you buy me a pizza? There is a dominoes right next door, if you have a coupon code that'd be helpful too! 
0	I was going to take them out and get something to eat but its raining and my tummy is grumbling for some pizza. 
0	Thank you guys! I hope to get pizza! 
0	edit: You guys rock. Thanks to Jesst for pizza and InfiniteInsight for kind words and company. 
1	  For the past months since I've been home from college my family's living situation has gone from bad to terrible.  My mom has been in and out work for even longer, and its been difficult to keep food in the home. Along with my Dad skipping out of child support payments and bills looming it hasn't been easy.     Me and my brother have been basically eating fried rice and beans for the last few weeks and could really use a decent meal like a hot fresh pizza.  
1	I'm a 21 year old college student who lives in Brooklyn, NY.  I'm currently broke and all my relatives are away till Sunday. All I have left is a bit of rice and kielbasa. Probably enough for the rest of today, but I don't know what I'm going to eat tomorrow.  My relatives are in a bit of a bind due to credit issues, so in general we are usually tight on money.  I'm starting work training for my new job next week (worried about talking about it due to NDA issues - similar to another post on Reddit that caused lots of issues for the guy who posted it).  If I could get just a pizza, even plain, the smallest size, it would be nice.  **EDIT** - Thank you [bearvivant](http://www.reddit.com/user/bearvivant) for providing me with a pizza in this time where I'm really down to little! I hope to offer pizza to someone in the future once I get this upcoming job.
0	.....
0	Hi RAoP, I'm new to the sub,and today my girlfriend left me, telling me to kill myself and that I deserve to die, calling me fat and saying that I'm useless, so, since she is calling me fat, I might as well sit back, relax, and get fat. Help me RAoP, stress is killing me.
0	Student living in waterloo, ontario. Sometimes all one needs to feel better in a time like this, is just drown your sorrows in a greasy pizza. Thanks
1	I finished my last box of cereal for lunch, all I have left is olive oil. I would greatly appreciate a pizza, I need something to last me till Sunday!
0	I understand there are other requests, and it's cool if mine doesn't get fulfilled. Just felt I might try to make someone chuckle. You don't even have to send a pizza if you just want to joke around. :)
0	I have no money for food, and have to eat at a soup kitchen for dinner, was wondering if anyone could get me a pizza for my birthday.
1	I have no monies at the current moment until I sell my minivan for 2500. I hope it sells for 2500. Until such a time I am lacking food. A nice peperoni pie would be wonderful if anyone is so inclined.   I will return the favor and come here and buy someone a nice box of goodness once my van sells.   I have just fallen on bad times, I have poof of my lack of funds if that is needed.   I forgot to tell my location in the title, I am currently stuck in the Panhandle of Florida.    *Edit: Looks like I can not make a complete sentence. Oh well that is life.*   *Edit 2: Nazoth gave me some Pizza, well gave me a gift card. Live so far out, delivery isn't an option. That explains the odd sounds I hear at night. I swear it might be an Ood. I shall ride into town in my blue minivan to pick me up a nice pie. I'll be sure to share the love once said ride is sold, in order to keep folks with some pizza. Everyone likes Pizza* 
0	[This is my bank statement](http://i.imgur.com/rjhWt.png).  My paycheck on friday might--**might**--get me back to 0.  Rent is due next week.  FML
0	Stupid student here at the end of exam period has spent all his student loan and would love to have a meal other than tesco own brand noodles (15p gotta love em).  Would really help with  revising for my computer science compiler exam and will pay it forward when I'm working this summer :D Thanks in advance.
0	I'm not going to lie about my economic situation, I can afford a pizza. If anyone would like to brighten an intern's day, SEND SOME PIZZA THISA WAY.     (rhymes for pizza?) 
0	Honestly, it has just been months since I've had a pie. Student loans are keeping my fridge pretty barren. Would really appreciate a piping hot slice right about now!
0	I am a college student who ate way too much ramen last semester since it was all I could afford. Its all I have in the house right now, but I would really love some pizza. I live in richmond, va.
0	I have only been working one day a week at work and I still have not received a pay check. I have been looking for a new job but no luck so far. keeping my hopes up but for now i am hungry.
0	Like it said in the post, My car broke down, so i have to look for a new job, broke as a joke and running out of food and heart, could use some cheering up. Thanks a bunch guys! *edit i live in Fargo ND
1	Hey all. I'm a nineteen year old college student, home for summer break and at home in New Jersey for fathers day with my two younger brothers. My mom drew short straws and is working on this Sunday/holiday, and my dad doesn't live with us anymore.  The house is almost bare and my mom won't be back until late evening, so I was wondering if there were any redditors out there willing to help my brothers and I out with a pizza for lunch/dinner to give this drab Sunday of ours a defining, yummy meal.  Thanks for reading! and have a great father's day all.
0	Really that's all. I love pizza... I will also tell a joke. What goes ho-Ho plop? Santa laughing his head off. 
1	I've had a very rough patch for the past 18 months. I could use any kind meal at this point. It's been nearly four days at this point since I've had anything aside from walmart canned fruit. I hate to ask for any kind of support, but at this point I'm dubious if I'll eat tomorrow. 
1	So, I haven't been able to keep anything but crackers down for a while now, and nothing has sounded good to me.  But I woke up today, and all I could think about was how damned good a pizza sounded. Except I'm broke until Thursday.  So, if someone is feeling generous, I'd absolutely love a simple pepperoni pizza.  I have a verification code, if that sways anyone's decision?
1	I'm a bit tired of my pantry of noodles and my paycheck comes next week. There's no real sob story, but I would seriously enjoy a change of pace ;)  I will pay it forward on Wednesday :)
0	I live in Monterrey Mexico, yup the city of Narcos, and I would love to see if there are any Regios willing to open their hearts and invite me with a RAOP.  Muchas gracias =)
0	If someone could get my brother and I a pizza, that'd be awesome.
0	Hi everyone I am in louisville ky and I am wishing for someone to please help us out for dinner tonight ..Me and my daughter are hungry and we would love some pizza for dinner..We get foodstamps but they dont come until tomorrow the 7th ..please and we have no food and are very hungry..thanks for reading
1	I'll spare the juicy personal details, but I lost a group of friends and a boyfriend because someone thought it would be fun to tell them all horrible, ridiculous lies about me. I really liked all of them, and took a huge risk trusting these people because I thought they were Good People. (I'm a child abuse survivor, so I have a real hard time opening up.) I also put in a lot of energy (made gifts, gave encouragement, helped calm down anxiety attacks...)  The good news is, if they're that quick to turn on me based on someone's false information, I don't want them in my life anyway. They never asked me if it was true, just took it as fact. That's not a "friend" in my book.  The bad news is, it obviously hurts really, really bad. I'm doing the best I can to not fall apart. It's really hard to stop thinking about everything that happened. I feel like I stepped on a landmine, everything blew up in my face. I really want to watch a movie and eat some pizza and forget about all this drama for a bit. (I'm broke, so anything not eaten tonight will help sustain me until payday!)   A gesture of kindness in the form of a pizza or even an inspiring message would mean SO much to me right now.  On a side note, pizza or no pizza, this subreddit is a great reminder that there are still kind people in the world.
0	...but I can't afford one. Not right now, anyway. It's a long story, but I'm transitioning between two jobs and it's cut back on my finances.   But, to be clear, I am not broke or starving. I would just like a pizza, with the promise to pizza it forward in two or three weeks when I'm settled in at my new job. 
1	I will receive my second paycheck at my new job (recent graduate) on the 10th! It's so close! But my last paycheck was on June 25 and all of that went to rent so we had to make $40 from my future husband's paycheck last us for groceries. I went shopping on June 29, but we have run out of all the food I bought. We would really love a pizza to hold us over today until my paycheck comes in.
0	My friend doesnt know Im doing this but she is on her last week in Hawaii and the guy she went there with is gone and shes spent all her money for moving expenses back to the mainland. I live in Florida but Im more broke than she is lol. Its her birthday and I was trying to find birthday freebies since she only has her cell for internet but wow... google maps shows no dice! She lives near the Battleship Missouri nearest I can tell lol. ( I never realized how big the island is!!). I am going to a meetup in an hour but will only be gone about 2 hrs. Its 530 here but 1130am there so there is time.  
0	i'm a disabled father living on disability and those checks don't go far after bills there is nothing left to treat my family to a dinner out,we haven't had a dinner out for 6 months.i would really like for them to have something different than hotdogs and tuna sandwiche's.please if you could help that would mean the world.thank you,i have a verification code if you need it and my location is conway,south carolina 
0	My summer job at a college orientation didn't pay me in time to pay most of my bills, and I'm actually still waiting to see that paycheck because when it finally got sent out it go sent to my grandparents' house two hours away. In the meantime, my roommates at my apartment are on a health kick and I haven't had red meat or anything greasy in weeks. Pizza would be a very, very welcome break from my circumstances right now!
0	3 dudes, recently moved to Austin to chase the dream.  Making rent our first month has totally tapped the funds.  All have just started work and are trying our damndest to stick it out until the first round of pay checks.  Any help is much appreciated!  Thanks and be excellent to each other!
0	I'd love a bite of food right now, outta money since I paid for Spring fees. Thank you! 2 polisci finals, one history one, one bio one...and a polisci paper.
0	Hi guys, tomorrow is my birthday and I would REALLY love some pizza after a long day of classes. Any offer would be greatly appreciated! 
0	First time requester here. I know it's pretty cheesy but I really love this girl, I want her to remember that I'll never stop caring. Recently, her car has been totaled so I haven't really been seeing her much like I used to. It's been about two months so far and every week I come by on the bus to see her and spend a couple days with her. She lives about 30 miles away so It's a definite I need to bus it trip. This week I managed to find her a ride here for our six months together and she's excited cause I planned it all out for her. I'm the first boyfriend shes ever had. She never dated anyone in high school so she got lucky with not having to deal with childish drama. We're going to Frank and Sons in the morning (her first time there), coming back to my place and relaxing with a nice massage (she loves them)  while we finish up our last four episode of Game of thrones season three. I have an intention to cook, but since I've been taking the bus. My funds are low and I haven't been able to buy anything to cook with. So I'm stuck with Easy Mac and a cake that I baked for her. A pizza would really help me out so I can at least buy food for the rest of the weekend so we can eat and if I'm lucky have some left over for Handel's (best ice cream ever). I just want to give her a relaxing day and weekend since she's been working so hard to pay for a new car. Thanks for considering to read all of that if you did!
0	It's sad I know. I really dislike Optics but it's one of those courses I have to take to graduate (computer engineering), kind of irrelevant for the field I want to go into. I will be forever grateful to whoever the mystery-pizza-sender is and will pass on the random-act-of-kindness to another stranger in some way or another.
1	Don't know where to start. My brother tried to commit suicide last Tuesday by ODing on the antidepressants he was just given by his psychologist.  I live about 300 miles away from home with my girlfriend currently. I only have intermittent part time work and just visited last weekend, so I'm too broke to go home again right away.  It hurts so bad thinking of him locked up in the facility, though my family can visit him 1 hour a day, and I call every day right after they're through to check up on him. Sounds like they've got him diagnosed but we have no idea when he's getting out.  This is half just to vent, I guess. Nothing is fun right now. I'm completely disinterested in my hobbies.  I know it's unreasonable, but I feel guilty when I'm having fun because I know he can't.  I wish someone could send him a pizza.  EDIT: If anyone's been in a facility for this before and wouldn't mind telling me what it was like, feel free to PM me.Thanks  EDIT2: I wasn't quite clear, I wanted to give him the pizza when he gets out. I'm happy to provide verification as well (I assume he'll work with me a bit in giving you guys like a hospital slip of some sort).  EDIT3: Verification for anyone who's interested, and wants to see the admission slip: http://imgur.com/fCkEnHK,eLaTaLI  He's coming home today or tomorrow.  Thanks everyone for the support.
0	He's broke, he's hungry, he's a good guy who deserves a nummy pepperoni pizza while he packs for our [very expensive] move.  I'm too broke or I'd get it myself, we're both planning on paying it forward after our finances recover from the move.  FWIW, he's also too proud to ask for himself, which is why i'm posting, info sent will be to get pizza to him at home, if that matters.
1	[Request] In state of profound shock! My debit card company discontinued their 'overdraft' option which, due to extenuating circumstances, I was counting on being able to use till my next paycheck. Currently have ZERO money for food till next weds. A pizza would hold me over till that date for sure!
1	My wife and I havent eaten anything but stale ritz crackers in four days we have managed to rummage up enough to buy our two kids one lunchable but to feed my kids tonight I might be forced to steal. We have lived in our car for a month since we were evicted from our apartment after both losing our jobs within a month of each other. please find it in your heart to help me and my family out. A young lady at the church told me about this website and I have nothing to lose... please help us.
1	LetsFytingLove is the best!
0	Was recently laid off, applied for unemployment last month, however due to the waiting week and a dispute from the company that laid me off, I won't be getting paid for another week! I'm down to 50 cents and a single pack of ramen noodles. Just trying to be able to eat! Help please!
1	I'm broke, unemployed, and my self-esteem is in the gutter. I could have it a lot worse -- I have a roof over my head, and I'm currently in school, finishing the prerequisites for a program I've dreamed of attending for years -- but to be honest, I'm pretty isolated right now, feel lonely, and pizza would make me feel better. Screenshot of my bank account balance and/or other verification available upon request. I hope to get a callback soon from one of the jobs I've applied for, so I can return the favor or pay it forward.
0	Just a pizza or two please ^_^
0	Hey, the title pretty much sums up the story. We're a little low on funds and a pizza for this forced bachelor would be very appreciated. 
0	Poor guy hasn't been able to shower taking care of our son who just started crawling like a maniac! I'm in Oregon and he's in Washington. He transferred the last of his money to me since I had to pay for my trip out of pocket with a reimbursement program.   He's pizza-obsessed! I would love to order it for him, but his transfer won't go through til Monday so were both lacking, he deserves it more though.   I will try and attach a photo of my crazy kid as well for good measure!!!   http://i.imgur.com/AczHQkD.jpg   http://i.imgur.com/Rol5zzM.jpg
0	I moved in with my grandma in Seattle who doesn't grocery shop at all and only buys takeout for herself. I'm paying for college and work for not much money and can't afford to buy a lot of food. I ate mostly oatmeal I found in the cupboard for a week. I also got high for the first time in a few months and that's making me extra hungry. So it's a combination of actual hunger with added munchies.
0	I barely slept last night so this won't be very eloquent. Yesterday evening my little dog had a seizure. She's had them before (very rare, vet said not to worry bc of infrequency) so we let her ride it out and she seemed to be feeling better. Then at 5am this morning she had another seizure, then another at 8am. I brought her to the vets where she got diagnosed with epilepsy and given some medicine. When we got home she had a 4th seizure and I had to bring her back for IV medication and medical monitoring. I'm a grad student (ergo broke) and am out $450 in vet bills just today and worried sick about my pup.   Please help me out. There is a Papa John's nearby and also a locally owned small pizza place that does online orders. I can provide proof of my story and I'm sure my pup would love a little pizza crust when we get to bring her home. 
1	I've been having a really difficult time getting on my feet. I was hit by a serious and ongoing neurological problem a couple of months ago, which has made it even harder to find work. I'm all alone in my crappy apartment, my family is hundreds of miles away and so is my girlfriend. I've never tried this before, but it would be great if I could get a big, greasy, sausage mushroom pizza. It's past 12:00 in NY, I wonder if anyone still even delivers...?  This is a really cool subreddit idea, by the way.
1	You can hold me to it, and even check up next week to see if I follow through. If i don't keep my word.... well i guess nothing will happen, but I assure you I'd feel too guilty not to.
1	Hey guys, I've been broke as a joke the last couple weeks. Raided the pantry completely and have made plenty of "canned food and rice" surprises. Last of the monies went in the gas tank and I'm now down to the last cup of applesauce and could use a solid meal and leftovers for the next couple days. I have payment coming this Tuesday/Wednesday and will gladly return the favor to my offerer!  Thanks!
0	Things didn't go quite as planned and I ended up watching my bf play video games all night in a friend's basement along with the privilege of being DD for the hour-long drive home. I'd just like to feel a bit special, even if it's a day late. 
0	My birthday is on tuesday the 27 and man some pizza would be so good!!!
1	Times have been tough lately, I'll spare the details, but there is a few other posts I have made in r/assistance and r/loans recently.  Long story short, I'm getting pretty sick of eating ramen and will continue to do so for about 2 more weeks, because, well, that's all I have.  I will gladly pay-it-forward in about a month or so.  Thanks for reading.
1	Hey R+, So here i am in africa for the past few months. About 2 weeks before i left for Africa my wife and i had a beautiful baby Girl. My wife is still back home in Warner Robins. She has taken care of the home front and done quite well at it. It has been hard on her though, She is new to the states (&lt;1yr) and the bit of seclusion and being stuck at home with our baby has kinda worn her out.   I am looking to try and surprise her and brighten her day a bit in different way.  If anyone would be willing to help out We Both would greatly appreciate it.   IN Summary: We live in Warner Robins Georgia, Wifey is kinda bummed w/ me being gone and i am trying a different route of brightening her day.   PS: I do have a verification code, (not sure how it works) 
0	Just three Southern Illinois University Carbondale students who are hungry! :) I took my girlfriend to the casino and then Olive Garden yesterday for her 21st and turns out I need to brush up on my Basic Strategy. Have a buddy over who is feeling blue and wish to feed him, but dont want to take the hit to the bank account.  A couple of pizzas and a 2-liter should accomplish that!   Thanks for reading!  **EDIT**: Ended up grabbing something else to eat tonight, but thanks for the upvotes! You stay classy, RAOP. 
0	Hey all, I'm a poor college student(what a surprise) posting here hoping to get some pizza. why do I need pizza, you ask? well, it's midterm week, and as a Senior in IT, i'm fucking stressed. I just learned today that my parents are getting a divorce, which was honestly not a surprise, but it still kinda hurt. I usually get by on shitty overpriced Cafeteria food but I just lost my shitty job mopping floors at Shaw's a couple weeks ago and there are ~no~ other jobs in my podunk little vermont town. All I ask is if someone can send some breadsticks or a Small pizza for me and my equally hungry Roommate, it would be mightily appreciated.
1	~~Title basically says it all. Unexpectedly lost my job at the end of January. I interviewed and got a new job around Feb 14-15, but didn't start until March 8th. Only just barely had enough to cover rent, bills, and a few~~ ~~groceries. I'll get my first check Friday morning, but I've been eating ramen for the last week and would really~~ ~~love some cheesy goodness.~~  ~~Thanks in advance!~~  EDIT: Thanks to Glinda_Da_Good_Witch!
1	Hello Random Acts Of Pizza.   I come to you with an odd request. It is not to receive a pie, but for help.    **By ordering your Papa John's Pizza from www.pizza.gg you can save 50% and support the growing industry of competitive gaming.**    What is competitive Gaming? Competitive Gaming, or eSports, is a growing industry that has received a huge boom in viewership over the last few years with the advent of new Internet streaming services. Professionals on teams get paid to play games like /r/starcraft /r/leagueoflegends /r/DotA2 at the highest caliber. They battle it out in [tournaments](http://www.dota2.com/international/announcement/) for millions of dollars year round.    Millions of people watch this content every week. However we do not have sponsorship money coming in from Coke, Honda, Mcdonalds, or other mainstream companies. Papa John's is a serious contender in an effort to get more lifestyle sponsors into our growing industry. This is their first major fore into our industry. They are dipping their toes in. We want to blow their expectations away.    If even a few of you make your papa john's orders by going through www.pizza.gg this week it will mean a lot to me and a bunch of other redditors. Thank you    tl;dr Save 50% help some dudes out who like to watch professional video games
1	Our local football team played a great game last night we absolutely enjoyed the game. My niece stayed the night last night and will be doing so again tonight. I would love to surprise them both with pizza. Small or medium would feed them both (they are 2 and 6) and make them and myself so happy. 
0	Would love to have a pie with my fam. Little ceasars is to much. 8 people so a slice a piece would do..wait grandson to small for a full piece. Hopefully thank you
0	We're a group of 4 college students, who don't have enough money collectively to buy ourselves a pizza, so we thought we may leave it to the RAOP gods (or goddesses) to decide whether or not we're meant to have this pizza. We live in Central California, and would very much appreciate a delicious pizza!  
0	Hey, everyone.   Between my roommate and myself, we have less than twenty cents. Neither of us are looking forward to going more days without eating.   A random act of pizza would be wonderful right about now. We would both be grateful and delighted. 
1	I'm a twenty year old who is taking time off from school, and just recently started working at a drugstore. I'm still a week away from getting my first paycheck, after being unemployed for two months, and I have $1.77 to my name after paying for rent. I would be greatly appreciative of even a small pizza, because I haven't eaten since Sunday. I'm sure this is a longshot because not many people are willing to spend that money, and I understand that completely. If out of some miracle the pizza angels are smiling upon me today I will gladly repay the favor as soon as I get my paycheck. I suppose it's also a significant fact that I'm vegetarian.
0	Title says it all if you could help I would love you forever!!
0	House sitting Uncle's house. They mostly have health food, and I'm craving something unhealthy.
1	We both work but it's still paycheck to paycheck. I sold an item on ebay to get some extra cash but since it was an awkward item to ship(giant plush lady and the tramp dog), it jacked the shipping from $30 to $58, I had to pay the $28 out of pocket since I told the buyer it would be only $30. So that sapped our funds until we get paid tomorrow. Until then, we starve as we have nothing at the house to eat. Not trying to give a sob story, just being honest.  But hey if we got a pizza, maybe the wife would stop bragging about pinterest :-)
0	I'm unemployed and have been chasing after job opportunities... Last night I got an IM from the president of a company with a promising job opportunity, only he told me that everything would be delayed because of issues with FCC regulations and I wouldn't start until February at the earliest. Yesterday my laptop broke and I had to send it in to Apple for repairs. This afternoon I broke the mirror on the closet door while putting a box back in the closet. I called around for quotes on a new mirror. It's going to cost me $100 to replace the mirror. I have to do it, as it's my landlady's property. Kinda bums me out, but it has to be done.  While it's not necessary, some delicious pizza would cheer me up quite a bit. I'll be able to pay it forward this weekend when I get some money. Thank you! :)
0	times are hard, and I'd just really enjoy a pizza like old times.
0	Once I'm stable again in a couple of paychecks (4-6 weeks! :( ) I plan to reciprocate.
0	Title says it.  Here's to hoping.  
0	I am new at this, but my friends have done this, and helped out many. I now have a job to start repaying the favors to people in need, cause I do believe in the golden.  Heard the RAOP has kinda become disappointing over the time, with people not repaying the favor, or doing what people request, or even just thanking people.  I am here for help to turn that around if some of you could show me that there are still some kind hearted people out there and supply my bunk mates, and myself with some zas.  We just got the job building car washes, out of town, and don't get paid for the next two weeks.  Ramen noodles are just not cutting it for this work.  Help however you can, we would be grateful for anything! 
1	I'm as broke as I've ever been and hungry. I'm typically the kind of person who tries to help others so I'm pretty sure I'll pay it forward the first chance I get.  *Laid off, foreclosed, evicted but still optimistic.
0	Hey all,  I recently tore the ligament in my left shoulder (two nights ago) and I am now stuck in my apartment. I am (like so many others) a broke college student who now has to pay for these medical expenses, and I find myself somewhat down in the dumps as I cannot hang out with my friends or do anything productive as I am hopped up on vicodin all day and night.   I could really use a small pick me up, maybe in the form of a pizza? :)   I plan to return the favor to the other needy posters here in this subreddit as soon as my shoulder heals :)
0	Hey guys, I'm really hungry. I could tell a sob story but I won't bore you. I get paid Friday and I will promise to pay it back to someone in this subreddit if you could be so Awesome as to grant me a pizza. End of story.
0	EDIT! fireflygirlie hooked it up! Thanks so so so much!   My boyfriend and I just broke up a few days ago. I'll try to keep it short because it's complicated and dramatic, but I'm heart-broken. I did pretty well the first few days, but it's finally setting in and I'm at a loss. I never saw this happening and I don't know what to do with myself. I'm trying to cheer up by watching reruns of Arrested Development. Since I'm paying 100% of the bills (another dilemma I'm attempting to work out), I'm flat broke. If there's a kind soul out there that could feed me some cheesy love, that'd be great.   I'm using a throwaway because I have some IRL friends that use Reddit and I'm a little embarrassed. Thank you for taking the time to read this.
0	So, i'm a student with no summer job and currently no money either. I'm returning to school tomorrow (free food!) but at the moment I got nothing to eat. I can offer verification or whatever info you need.  I suppose omething like pizza-online would work? Thanks in advance!
0	Here is where I say something witty or heart wrenching one to entice you,  the kind provider, to provide me with a free pizza. But its hard to be witty on an empty stomach (heart wrenching), and I would make a joke about pizza but its too cheesy (witty).   
0	but we have no one in our life here to offer to feed us tonight.  I would LOVE for you to feed us this night with your gift of the following: 1 large pepperoni and sausage pizza med crust for my- Hubby and Son I would like a medium veggie heavy on veggies pizza ...thin crust , extra sauce :)  you are interested in doing this ...we have a pizza hut and other pizza places in our area that are healthier....let me know how you want to do this Thank you and please know we will return the same energy next month to someone...we are it...us three...we have no one to grieve with or to feed us tonight on a night of sadness and grief to do this :) No scam...Let me know if you want to see the obit 
1	My girlfriend has been in the hospital for the past eight days, recovering from a very dangerous  but very successful (YAY!) cancer surgery.  I've been balancing  taking care of our 3 year old son and visiting the hospital for the past week, taking time off of work.  I'm quite hungry.
0	O sweet reddit bless this hungry young chap with the pizza of my dreams.
0	Greetings all. This is a brilliant subreddit, and deserves all the attention it's been getting. Anyways; I'm stuck at work until 5PM. I don't have a lunch, nor the money for it (my paycheck isn't until next week). Any kind folks out there willing to trade a pizza IOU? Will definitely be returning the favor next week.
1	I'm just really hungry and low on cash right now. Will pay it forward once I get my money. Thank you. :)   EDIT: PensiveShadows saved me from a night of hunger.You're awesome&lt;3. :)
0	After having just finished paying two months rent, and my sister's infant getting sick, our family is in a seriously tight bind, cash wise, for the next two weeks. We've had troubles before though and made it through, this just makes it the perfect time to ask for your help in solving the real problem...  After almost a year of trying to convince her otherwise, my mother believes that Reddit is at it's core, a place where people go to lie about how wonderful their life is or post pictures of their animals. (Basically anything told to her about Reddit from watching the news) She doesn't realize that Reddit can be a great source of kindness that can touch even the average user if you seek it from subs such as [/r/depression](/r/depression) , [/r/progresspics](/r/progresspics) and of course [/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza](/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza).  With our recent cash problems, it would go a very long way in making her realize how important Reddit has been to me, along with hopefully making her realize the true nature of the people on this site, if she were to receive a Pizza from a generous stranger during a difficult time.  Thank you in advance! This site and this subreddit are wonderful! 
1	So, I'm hungry, and I want pizza (I'm in Texas).  But I'd really like to trade you for it!  I have a REALLY cute dog (a Chihuahua, but not the kind that can be mistaken for a rat) and I have some pretty cute pictures of her that I'll "trade" for some pizza.  You can talk with PastafarianTwit if you need verification that she's cute!  :)  PLUS, to sweeten the deal, I'll post a Thank you, with some pics of pizza and puppy, so everyone can enjoy!  :)  I'll be in the chat room and lurking here if you'd like to set up the deal.  And gosh, this sounds like I'm trying to trade drugs, but no, only cute puppy pictures for nom-able pizza. :)  Thanks in advance!  EDIT: DrinkNDerive can also independently confirm that the pics I have to offer are top-grade cute.  EDIT the 2nd: I got too hungry, with no responses, so I ordered on my own.  Still, if you'd like to still trade for a gift-card for future pizza, PM me and we'll work something out.  :)
0	I would love some pizza for my little sister and me :)
1	So, my best bud had  his phone stolen over the weekend in a break-in. Right after he lost his phone he learned that his paycheck was messed up with our university. I want to help him with a pizza but I can't afford it myself considering I am a student as well. Anyone want to help him?
0	I am new and have no idea if I am doing this right or if this can even be done.  I was on Facebook and somehow clicked on this guy's page where I saw he was going to a food bank and got denied.  I have no idea who he is.  He sounds hungry and I'd be giving him a pizza myself, but am disabled and broke until my tiny check comes next month. I can post a link to his FB page (don't know if I should include it here) and hopefully someone can help him out. I read about what you all are doing here, on CNN news site a while back, and was so touched by this effort.  You all are amazing!  Please help me get this guy some food. :)
0	Don't have anything to eat but peanut butter for the next three days. Will pay it forward when I can
0	just feeling some pizza, if you can, awesome.. if not well-- i appreciate the kindness of all others anyways!
0	Mishawaka IN College student would love a pizza. I think I'm a decent singer, and I'll sing you any song (within reason, ie, if I know it)
0	We're broke college students. If we don't get pizza soon I fear we're gonna start eating each other. But we have a guitar and shitty singing abilities!  Edit: We're in Greeley, CO
0	HULK LOVE PIZZA BUT HULK LOSE HIS WALLET WHILE HULKING OUT AT BAR LAST NIGHT. CAN ANYBODY HELP HULK
0	My boyfriend and I are both college students who survive on financial aid. We have very little money to spend, and don't have the ability to eat out often. Though we are not in desperate need, a pizza would be a wonderful gift to brighten our spirits (and a nice change from pre-packaged food). It's hard to have your nose on the grindstone all of the time and not be able to go out for food or fun, but if there are people who need it more, please, help them!
1	I posted yesterday but a very nice lady from work knew I was having some financial trouble and got us food for last night. So I deleted my request. Today we are back in the same boat. Like I stated yesterday, this is out of my comfort zone because I am usually the one trying to help somebody. My husband was laid off about 3 months ago and we usually are able to make it from check to check. I also take care of my Grandmother how is disabled. But this week has been rough. My car broke down on Tuesday. Had to get a new battery and a couple of other small parts to get it back running. This set us back. We are now Broke. We are going to try to have a yard sale tomorrow to get up a little money but have nothing for tonight. I am more than willing to pay this forward when I get paid again next Friday July 15. Thanks for your consideration.
0	The title pretty much sums it up, but my friend's in town for a few days before he gets deployed to South Korea for a year. Tonight's the goodbye party for him and his girlfriend, who's moving to Pennsylvania for school. I'm from out of town and spent all my money on gas driving up to see them, and the party host spent all his money on the booze. Anyway, if anyone would be willing to support our army hero with a pizza, we would appreciate and pay it forward when we're able. :]  EDIT: Should probably mention that we're in the Coeur d'Alene, ID/Spokane, WA area.
0	My son has been requesting pizza all day and I would love to give it to him, but my husband is at work so I don't have a car to go to walmart to pick up a frozen one with food stamps and we don't have the money to get a pizza delivered.  This is my first time on here and I promise to provide a pizza for someone else on a different day when I can afford it, but for now I am just looking for a pizza.  Thanks
0	No monies.. i cant live on super noodles forever need da pizza :O
0	Hi everyone...I have a job, and I go to school, but recently, I've found myself broke, with my car in the shop.  My checking account is in the negative and my fridge is pretty bare.  I would love a pizza today.  I figure I can make a few meals from it.  When I get my finances back on track I will pay it forward for someone else.  Thank you in advance and have a great day :)  DM
1	Which sadly doesnt pay the bills or food, but pads out my resume and makes me not look like a slacker. I was made redundant by my previous employer, and despite sending it out to many places, I still have no work...things are looking up but it just takes time...
0	Basically, a year ago I bought a computer using a credit card offered with a 0% introductory APR for a year. Buried in the fine print was a line explaining that I would be charged 22.9% interest on my initial purchase if I didn't pay in full after 12 months. I didn't realize that bit until yesterday, the one-year anniversary of my purchase (I posted a whole thread about the episode elsewhere). The result - a surprise $500 charge to my card.  And of course all of this happened when my payment plan failed as a result of my financial aid being literally obliterated this year. The state decided to take my grant offers away.  So that was just really rough. I feel awful and scared and screwed and I have no idea how I'm going to to get out of this debt any time soon. Doesn't help that I was planning to go to grad school next year. No idea how that will work out now.  So I'd like some pizza to dull the pain. It would literally mean an absolute ton to me right now. Thank you for reading this.   Edit: I'm in Chico, CA.
0	So lately I have been having a hard time buying quality food, often times just eating a one bowl of cereal or spagettio's a day. I am getting tired of eating microwaveable/easy foods so I figured I would turn to reddit for some help!  It would be greatly appreciated if someone sent an extra pizza my way, and the best part about pizza is that I could always save more for later!!! Thank you ahead of time for any offers!
0	for a week and a half now I've been surviving off of an egg a day, I just heard of this miraculous community service today, and ask some wealthy aristocrat to spare a few cents and allow me the delicious mouth party of one Pizzaville pizza, in my opinion the best pizza in Toronto.  Much love and respect Hungry editor Worldmind.
0	I would greatly appreciate a pizza tonight :) I can pay it forward on the 28th as that is when I get paid again. Sorry if that makes the title misleading...I just like Popeye :)
0	Will pay it forward on the 28th when I get paid. Thanks in advance. Can also do some minor photoshop work for you if you need. (I need the practice anyways). Any other questions feel free to ask. 
0	tl;dr: I'm broke and hungry  nom nom nom plz
0	Not much to say, boyfriend and I are rather broke at the moment, and can't get a hold of any local friends to help us. A pizza will at least tide us over for the night until we can get to the food bank tomorrow.
1	I'm drunk(ish) and my boyfriend is also drunk(ish) and we're hungry, but we spent all of our money on xmas gifts for each other.  He bought me an iPod Touch!!!! He's awesome.  We're just broke now till next Friday.  Anyone able and willing would be greatly appreciated! ;)
0	My partner and I just moved to this town recently after living out of our car for a while and are really struggling to get by. We put everything we had into getting an apartment so we wouldn't be homeless anymore. I haven't been able to find a job since moving, and my partner just finally found a job this week and won't get his paycheck for another two weeks. Rent is due tomorrow so we have nothing left for food. We have applied for assistance from other programs but haven't received anything as of yet. (Also normally my boyfriend recieves the GI Bill, but we had to move so he couldn't be in school this semester.)   Anyways we have never asked for help before and honestly it's hard even writing this, but we are sitting here trying to scrounge together a meal and it's just not enough. We would love a helping hand until we can get back on our feet - then we'd be happy to pay it forward! Also I'm new to this sub and read the side bar, but if I'm not doing anything correctly just let me know :)
0	I think, finally, my roommate and I have hit rock bottom right before things start to look up, which always seems to be how it goes, doesn't it?  We have less than five dollars in the house, I maxed my credit card ages ago, and I won't be getting paid until next friday and god knows when he will as he hasn't even started his new job yet.   I'm so proud of how far we've come, starting the year more or less homeless to being able to afford a house and a dog until he lost his job. We managed to scrape together rent for this month, but I'd really rather not eat rice for the next seven days as that is literally all we have left in our cupboard aside from some baking essentials. Rice, waffles, and cake, diet of champions...  I would offer something in exchange but anything I can make costs more to ship than I will have for ages. If you want I can draw you something, I guess? Any help would be beyond appreciated and once he starts his job in a couple weeks, I will be sure to pay it forward!  
1	I'll pay it forward ASAP... (Friday, when I get paid.) Snowy Chicago isn't very pretty on an empty stomach.
0	I graduated in June from UCLA. I didn't have a job at the time but I had some money and I want to be a screenwriter so I need to live in L.A. So, I set out to find a job. Was not looking for a dream job, just something to pay the bills. Now, here I am three months later and, if a miracle doesn't happen in the next six days, I'm moving back in with my parents. 
0	Ok, first of all, I just made this account, A really good friend of mine suggested that I might be able to find some help out today.  i'm 4 hours away from my wife and daughter, because of my job.  I don't get paid any kind of money until tomorrow.  I Would love to have a pizza, I'm in a place i don't know anyway, and i'm only here for work.  I work outside all day long, and i'm starving!  if someone could help me out, I will gladly return the favor when i get my paycheck.  i'm just tryin to get some help today. thanks so much!
1	I'm a student who is currently looking for work.  My husband works long hours, but (after a series of unfortunate and close-together events) we are completely BROKE.  In all honestly, it's inspired the kind of creative cooking that is fun every once in a while.  Alas, we just ate our last bag of dry beans and our bank account is over-drafted due to unavoidable bills (will send a screen shot of bank account, if desired).  I'd like to say that we could pay you back soon, but until I find a job that's a promise I can't commit to.  I do, however, plan on getting more involved in this community once we're back on our feet.  I love reading about the kindness of strangers and would love to participate soon!  I'm planning on going to our local food bank tomorrow if this doesn't produce any fruit...I hate to do that because there is always someone in more need than I am, but when you're on your last packet of ramen, things get desperate!  Anyways, thanks for reading and happy reddit-ing!  
0	This is actually my first time on Random Acts of Pizza. Me and my girlfriend have been in our first tight spot in a long time, I don't get paid for 3 more days, financial aid from ACC has yet to come in, and we are down to 15 dollars, 1/8th tank of gas. We have been living off pbnj and ramen. A friend recommended me to this website when she heard how hungry I was at work &gt;.&lt; I would be extremely appreciative, and would definitely like to help someone in return as well. We can take pictures of the pizza too Tashia gets off school in about an hour, maybe she can have pizza instead of ramen
0	I am stuck in small vilage in UK called South Killingholme, near Grimsby, which is as grim as the name suggests, no car, and busses suck. Miss having pizza but unsure if any deliver, would hope someone to prove me wrong.
0	I don't want to post from my main, but I've been a redditor for some time now. I live with my boyfriend and roommate, and both are in between jobs right now. I've known my roommate since high school and I know that if I ask them to leave, they will have nowhere else to go. I'd love to have a roommate or boyfriend for that matter that doesn't stress me out and put so much pressure on me when it comes to money. I should actually be saying MY MONEY, but I never get to see any of it. My income goes straight to bills and food.   I am coming to a point where I no longer see both of the people that I live with as just having a hard time. They've been unemployed since February and June, and I've been paying for everything for months. I really can't take it anymore. I can't even put away enough money to take a trip to get away from everything and everyone. Between work and school, I am really at my limit.  I'm hoping that another redditor who has been here before in this situation will help me with something other than canned vegetables for dinner (pretty please? :D). I would love a pizza and it would pretty much make my entire year, because this would be the only nice thing I've gotten. If someone is able to help, you would be a hero! I should also mention that I'm in NYC (Brooklyn stand up!). 
0	9 kids to feed, health took down spiral, and job closed to due economy. Appreciating any help necessary. If able e-card is sufficient.
0	please i need a pizza! we are so hungry we would love you forever go dawgs
0	My funds are getting really low. I fucking love pizza, but I ate my last frozen one two days ago. Then yesterday I finished off my shitty instant rice. 
0	My friends and I are just hanging out watching some crappy movies on Netflix. As silly as our request is, we'd just love some pizza. It'd be much appreciated.
0	My wallet, containing my last paycheck until i start up training at my new job, was stolen on my way to deposit the check. A replacement won't come until Friday (as i am now in a different city), and i am already in the red with the purchase of new semester books and rent.
0	But I'm still trying to keep my head up, It's not all bad though, I passed my Exams and not failing. But now I'm home filling out applications really hungry and tired of Ramen noodles. Thanks in advance!
0	Me and my son would really love a pizza for dinner we havent eaten out in over two months and its just too hot today to cook. I have been cooking at 9/10 olclock at night so it would be nice to eat at a decent time for once. Can someone pls help us.
1	We're planning a move across the country in about 3 weeks. We've got some money saved for the trip and getting set up out there, but we're pretty limited on funds now. Any pizza would be greatly appreciated. We're both hungry and any scraps will be fed to our two cats, who just happen to love pizza too.  [Here](http://imgur.com/tOHAK) they are right now. Look at those eyes, gleaming with the anticipation of cheesy delicious pizza. 
0	Please and thank you. :)
0	Unexpected costs regarding my car have made it very difficult to keep up. If I can avoid borrowing money from anyone until Friday, I should be on track. That being said, I am tired of eating firm tofu or celery and vegan peanut butter. I have gas in the car to get to work, I just need a few nights worth of food (real food) to get through til payday. Once I am back on track, I promise to pay it forward here.  **EDIT: Forgot to mention I am in the Las Vegas area. If there is something you want from here/me let me know I am definitely willing to work something out.**
0	I love pizza but i dont have any money. I have it, just cant spend extra on pizza otherwise ill have to live on the streets. money is that tight. You can say it's tight like a virgin. If anyone can help, ill eat.
0	Me and my family never spend time together so i want to try and get a pizza,watch a movie and talk about our day
0	My truck got stolen this morning before work, I had started my truck and had to go back in to grab my cellphone, and when I came back out I saw the taillights of my truck going down the road. Since I had to call off work last week while my daughter had food poisoning, and since I was late today my boss fired me on the spot. And to top it all off the clarinet I had rented for her band class was in my truck, now I owe 600 dollars to the store for it, and I still have to rent her another one. Wednesday has always been pizza night for me and my daughter, I only get her on the weekdays during the summer, and school starts Monday. 
0	Not much to say, super hungry and bored and i don't get paid until next week. If anyone wants to help a bro out it'd be legit.
0	I've been unemployed for a little over a month and my financial situation is extremely dire for the next week or so.  Just started a new job today and the future is looking bright, but this week will be extremely tough. Thanks for reading!
0	I'm not starving, or without income. I'm a little broke right now, but there's definitely food in the pantry. But you know what? It's all healthy food. And fuck that. I just really want a pizza. Or as Dr. Steve Brule would say, a prizza. **It makes me really fucking happy.** See? Look at this pic of me eating pizza! Look how happy I was in that moment! http://i.imgur.com/kDS2u.jpg You, good sir or madame, could make me that happy again. It is within your power! Plus I'd probably take a bunch of photos of myself LOSING MY SHIT over the pizza. It'd be really undignified and manic. 
0	Pimpin aint easy!   To expand on this, I'm feeling a little down. Some pizza might be able to cheer me up. Unfortunately, my financial situation (broke, college, etc.) wont allow it. I feel a little awkward just begging on here, and im sure this wont work, but I figured why not. =/ Anyway, if for some reason you do feel like helping me out I would be really grateful. 
1	Not too much of a sad story, just an overworked, incredibly stressed out mama here who is very tired of eating Ramen for ALL the meals. Had a really crazy week, especially yesterday... And would love the relief of not slaving over hot stove for the kids dinner &amp; then eating Ramen myself.  Never done this before, so I don't quite know what else I need to do. But if anyone is willing to help... I can pay it forward on the 10th :)   Ughh I thought I put this in the title. Sorry! I'm in Kansas City, MO :)
1	hey redditros,   Just asking for a pizza for me and my kids. Single father, times are rough, and a pizza would surely help us bring our spirits up.   
0	I am very hungry dont have anymoney and there is no food send me a e-giftcard please
0	No dominos, pizza hut, alfys, or even papa johns. What am I going to do?!
1	Hi pizza friends!  My stupid scooter broke down (Honda makes a great motorbike for people who like to walk!) and I lost my job.  My mechanic's ma is very ill and I'm being a good patient doobie while he takes care of business, but time, money, and food are running out.  Could one of you folks help me out out with a meal?  Many many thanks. :D
0	Hungry and broke college student here, would be eternally grateful for a pizza to hold me over until I can afford groceries again later this week. [I painted Pizza Cat for y'all!](http://i.imgur.com/W1513UK.jpg)
0	Decorating the Christmas tree (finally) and would love an easy and delicious dinner of pizza. This is our first time posting here and i must say its pretty damn awesome... whether we get pizza'd or not we will try and pizza someone soon! :)
0	I have battled addiction all of my adult life - I have had long clean times (2 years), short ones, I've overdosed 4 times, and been to a lot of rehabs. I just returned home from yet another one and am starting over, have been going to meetings, have a sponsor, just got a job (though won't see any wages from it for weeks) and things are generally looking up. I won't lie - I'm certainly not in dire straits, but I sure could go for a pizza today.
1	just got the pizza! thank you soo much to oOBlackRabbitOo!!!
1	So today I got fired, which blows. My car got hit last night in the parking lot and the whole front in is destroyed. I called into work and said if I didn't make it in I would be fired. I couldn't find a ride from anyone, so I got fired. Definitely a total bummer day. If anyone can help me out, I would appreciate it a ton.
0	My last final is tomorrow, but due to Drum Corps stuff, I'll probably be living here away from home until next Monday. I'm out of university money and real money, spent the last of it on bills and a meal the other day.   I understand if this isn't going to happen, just hoping that some person out there will want to donate a bit of love to a Redditor and his friend.   If anyone can do this, I  live in Greensboro, NC
0	So I figure you may like some background information.  I parked my car in my apartment complexes parking lot over night and when I woke up the next morning to head to work I saw that my windshield had looked like it was hit with a baseball bat.  [A picture of my windshield](http://i.imgur.com/TjMr1ml.jpg)  So anyway, I call a local glass shop to get my window fixed and they say they can do it the next day while I'm at work.  The next day happens and I am getting ready to leave work and my windshield is still broken.  Because they couldn't keep to their schedule, I decided to cancel with them and call a separate place.  They come and fix it the next day and were super professional about the entire thing.  However, when they replaced the windshield they took my parking permit for my apartment complex with the old windshield.  So now I have been having to find street parking every day until my apartment complex's office is open so I can try to get a new one from them.  I am just lucky I saw that my sticker was gone before my car got towed.   Anyway, tldr; My car windshield got hit with what looks like a baseball bat and would appreciate some pizza!
0	 I just started a new job about a week ago, and I have .62 cents in my bank account. Luckily I bought a bus pass to get me to and from work before I ran out of money. I'm finally getting up on my feet but right now is the hardest time for me. I would be homeless if not for my best friends parents who took me in. Please, it would really help me out... I know I can make a pizza last at least a few days. Anything helps out in these times.
0	So spice up my life with a pizza! Broke, it ain't no joke, my landlord wants to get payed, and my stomach wants something other then peanut butter. Figured I would try to get a treat before I sell my laptop!  Thanks, yo.  And feel free to mail me smokes, hardyhar, haven't had one since last Thursday.. but, hell, might as well just quit. 
0	I have a pretty awesome life. Seriously. I have a good husband and great friends, I'm finishing up school...   but this week has been pretty rough and I am craving pizza and already spent my share of the monthly eating-out budget. If someone could get me a small pizza, it would be absolutely amazing.
0	I really really really hate asking for things, especially from strangers. I lost a bunch of hours on my last check, and have been surviving on the 4 dollars u had left after rent, ramen is nasty. If you want to help someone out, this guy is desperate for some protein. Thank you even if you don't help.    Edit. I am in Peoria illinois, if that helps. I am also down to walk to your house and clean for food at this point in the day if you live in ptown. 
0	Father has cut me off completely, refuses to pay for my final semester in school have been searching for jobs in LA for the past 2 months with no luck. I've sold most of my video games, music equipment and just about everything of value for food, but have finally run out of things to sell. Am finally giving up and will be flying to Florida next week to stay with my mother find a job and save up so I can return to school.  I would be eternally grateful if anyone could help me out with a pizza :)
1	Thanks in advance to anybody willing to help us out.
0	Hi RAOP I'm a student in Florida and I would like to request a pizza. My situation is that I've run out of money basically paying tuition for summer classes and have to survive for two weeks on about $15 until my financial aid check comes in the mail. I would greatly appreciate a pizza or gift card in order to make surviving a bit easier. Thanks for reading
0	I can provide proof by way of drivers license picture and bank account screenshot by PM.  Using a throwaway because I go to meetups and I don't want people to go in my comment history and know me as the guy without money or friends.  
0	Regardless of the subject, regardless of whether you care to compensate me with delicious pizza, this sort of thing is great to keep my drawing chops up. I prefer Domino's gift cards if you are pleased with my work and wish to feed me.  Edit: [0_0](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T2l15bKMZk) Remember, I'll draw for you, even with pizza-y goodness. 
0	Girlfriend and I just went to a coin star and cashed in our change jar to buy some cheap food items... We would love a dinner that isn't rice or beans. Will surely pay it forward when I am able. Thanks.
0	My Birthday is this friday (November 16th) and I'm turning 21! :D I'm extremely excited! I've been browsing Reddit all evening and I randomly got the idea! /r/RandomActsOfPizza was what originally brought me to Reddit for the first time; just the amount of awesomeness involved is unlike anything else I've seen. I've never actually had a good enough reason to post here (other than having the munchies) but now I think I do! It'd make my 21st birthday awesome!
0	US Army soldier broke and all the dining facilities are closed. Haven't eaten anything in 24 hours due to being on shift, and could really use a pizza right about now. 
1	I missed two weeks of work earlier this month due to an episode of depresion, and now the bills are looming so money's tight. Been living off cups of ramen and bowls of pasta to cut down on food costs, but a pizza craving is hitting me hard today. I'd appreciate it, and pay it back (or forward!) when I get some money to myself.
1	Helloooo, I just got my wisdom teeth taken out on Monday and they were killing me for about two weeks prior to that. All of that equates to me not having eaten anything other than soup for almost three weeks :( I am finally feeling better and really want to eat something real, but being that I'm a bartender and haven't been able to work for over a week, I haven't made any tips that can help me with said food. To add to that, I would love to share requested pizza with my boyfriend, since he's had to deal with my drugged up whiny ass for a week, and it'd be a nice treat for him. If anyone's willing to help, we'd love to pay it forward within the next few weeks.. Thanks so much!
0	Pizza Pizza. Sitting at my computer watching my eyes turn red in the reflection. HELP PLEASE
1	 I dont want to eat from the public park trash. Please we are sitting here anticipating eating.    Dont worry, the dog eats the cans i bought for him. Please someone help us, im on the verge of tears. We are homeless and our ebt does not come in until next week. I landed a job interview for monday, but dont want to celebrate with starvation. Please someone care.
0	My partner and main support system is out of the country for three months. Work has been especially frustrating and I'm waiting to hear if I got into the school I want to go to. Rent and bills have emptied my accounts and while I do have food at home, (rice and beans) I'm just feeling too overwhelmed to cook.   I'm located in Portland, OR. 
0	Hey! Just got off my retail job that im working until i finish my teaching certification (hs math/physics).   Been eating peanut butter sandwiches for a few days now until i get paid at the end of the week.  Would really appreciate it and would repay the favor soon!  Thank you! May The Flying Spaghetti Monster grace you with his noodly appendage!
0	Hey Reddit! I turn 21 today and its a great feeling. However my family is gone for the rest of the day and won't see them until the late evening. Could one of you guys make my day! Thanks
0	I just paid my rent/utilities today.. which was all of my money. so now I am completely broke until next friday when I get paid
0	I had heard it was coming down the pike, but my work cut my hours back because of the Affordable Care Act. I'm working 23 hours, part time per week. I get paid at the end of the week but I have some things I have to take care of, so I'll be hungry til next paycheck. Any help at all would get me through 3 or 4 days if I space it out.   I literally haven't had a scrap of food since Sunday night. Also, I live just down the street from a Pizza Hut, so I can pick it up to avoid a delivery charge.  **EDIT** Begging
0	We've been working all afternoon and we're both very hungry. We would really appreciate the kindness of a stranger!
0	Payday is days away and the girls would like pizza. I am seriously tapped out. I am talking down to change. I just found this Random Acts Of Pizza when I came to Reddit for a different reason. I promise I will pay it forward on payday. Can anyone help me make my deserving daughters happy today?  Thank you kindly
0	drugs. i fucked up, and will probably be punished for the rest of my employable life.   EDIT 8/1/12: [help a brother](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXxOU49TVKA) enjoy a few little things.  edit 8/2/12: ;/
0	I'm stuck dogsitting at the last minute tonite with no (human) food, and I can't walk this dog to the store (he's trying to eat everyone he sees) and I can't leave him here, because I have "no pets" on my lease, and he will start HOWLING every time I leave...help!! I'm so hungry, this is insane!!!
0	Been rough the last two weeks due to a mishap with my army pay. So Ive gotten down to the bare bones nothing on money till Friday. I know sounds all "Meh a begger" but I will 100% repay the kindness with a meal of your own friday. I believe in the firm policy of treating others fairly.
1	Hey guys I've been without stable income for a couple months now and have eaten nothing but ramen for 2 weeks. Any money I end up scraping together goes to my rent so I'm not couch surfing. I was just wondering if anyone would be able to help me out here. Ramen is ok but it makes me want to hurl after a while. Here is my bank account http://imgur.com/WW08gM5  I don't know if ill be able to provide anyone with any in the near future but if someone could help me out that would be great and if not that is fine to. Thank you for your time.
0	hello im a single mother of 2 im currently unemplyed I dont like to ask for help but im starving I was supposr to recieve child support but havent yet so if anyone can please help I will return the favor when I scrape up some money
0	There's a bunch of people around here who actually need a pizza 'cause they don't have food or whatever. So if you're looking to give, get to them first.   I've been depressed for quite a while now, give or take 4 years, mainly due to the pressure from my family to go to college and get a degree. I've messed up quite a bit during that time, all of it my fault honestly, and so I've gotten academically suspended for a year. This has escalated my depression because I feel like I'm just throwing away opportunities like it's nothing and letting everyone I know down. Today's been especially bad, I had a pretty shitty dream were everyone finds out what I failure I am, the first thought I had today was about suicide. I know I wont do anything, but it's still an awful way to start my day. So I've been drinking the day away and being generally useless.   Sorry for the boring story but it just feels better to type it out. It's not like I'm lacking food, I could go make a sandwich, but a pizza would be nice since I don't have the money for that.     
0	I'm a broke college student that would love a pizza.  I have only $2 right now and have no food out my apartment. I will not be able to buy food until next week. I hate to ask for help but a pizza could go a long way and give me a few meals.  I promise to return the favor as soon as I have the money to.  
0	My cousin about a week ago tried to change my oil in exchange for letting him use my car to drive to work. Since MN has pretty good Metro Transit, I use that to get to and from class every day.  Cue Friday when I finally had to use my car. Oil light is on. Check the oil. THERE IS NO OIL. He messed up the oil filter and everything leaked out. Had to spend the only money I had left (until tomorrow) fixing it.  Could use a Pizza tonight. My other option is to use the couple bucks i have to buy McDonalds, but then not be able to take metro transit and therefore miss class.   Let me know if you want to help out! I will definitely pay it forward next week. :)
0	So my mom is without electricity for a week so my sister and her friend along with my mom are staying over here so they don't have to deal with this heat. My mom just started her new job and I got fired at mine a week ago :'( (have applied everywhere and am pretty much now harassing places hoping to get hired) I am currently without money and my mom doesn't have enough to buy dinner so I am coming to reddit for some help. I am in an area where there isn't much selection and I don't think the closest place (which is pizza hut) delivers out here but I do have gas to pick it up. Thanks.  EDIT: Forgot to mention that I would obviously repay the favor to someone else in the future. Thanks again!  EDIT2: Forgot to say what state in in d'oh I'm in Maryland
1	Thanks for getting this far.   Not to pile on the bad news, because it really isn't that bad, but I just got a call from the landlord that the power's been out for a few hours in my complex, and to be careful of the food in the fridge when I get back from work.   Sounds like it could be a long Monday.  ~Nashville TN
0	Howdy everyone,  The water heater in our house and the air compressor died in our truck, stealing money away from our grocery funds. If anyone could be so kind to buy us a pizza so my wife and I can eat something other than top ramen and corn, it would be appreciated so much. We aren't picky, just hungry, cheese or pepperoni would be fine. I can write a Haiku for the wonderful person who feeds us!
1	Hi guys, I would loveeeee a pizza tonight. If anyone feels like giving one away I would love you. Thanks
0	Times are tough. Any help appreciated.my ex really dislikes me atm. 
0	We have a problem. We desire Zza, yet we lack the required funds. Please help us impoverished college bums with our urgent dilemma. 
0	From this site: http://ctscampaign.weebly.com/strike-support.html  &gt; Primo's Pizza, a locally owned and teacher-friendly restaurant near the strike HQ delivering pizza, pasta and salads. Call Gus or Daisy at Primo’s Pizza at  (312) 243-1052 .  Primo’s is at 816 W Van Buren Street, Chicago. Open 11 am to 9 pm Monday through Friday.  My sister is a Chicago teacher, and she says they'll begin picketing, tomorrow, so sending deliveries to schools in striking districts will likely reach appreciative mouths, as well.  Anyway, I hope we can show at least a few teachers some love from all over.
0	I was wondering if someone could possibly help me and my family for dinner tonight. Its me and my girlfriend and our two boys. Things have gotten really tough. My girlfriend lost her job due to her getting sick and they wouldn't work with her with flma. She is waiting on a settlement with unemployment. I cant work right now, and i'm waiting on a disability hearing. Food is very limited and we don't get food stamps for a few weeks. It would bring our spirits up some, and i know the boys would like it. I could pick up, so delivery isn't needed. I can pay it forward with no issues as soon as she gets her settlement on her card. I would really really appreciate this...thanks so much for reading!
0	I live in Tucson, AZ, and came out of work to find a small tree on the hood of my car after this afternoon's lovely storm. Fixing this is going to be the rest of my money until payday on Friday, and I'm just hoping that there's someone out there thinking about passing on a pizza. I'm a big believer in karma, and I'm hoping that she's going to be kind to me after the past few weeks of absolute shit. UGH. Right before my vacation, too :(
0	I was supposed to get paid for tutoring this week, but my student got a speeding ticket and paid that first.  A pizza would feed us for the next couple of days, and I would weep with relief if we got some help. I also have hypothyroidism, and going hungry can be really difficult for me. If you give me your address, I will send you a thank you card in return, and I will write your name/username in Arabic for you, if you want.
0	I've got finals for summer semester this week, and I'm spending everyday until Tuesday holed up in my room with my books. Pizza would be greatly appreciated. Help me make good grades!   After my finals are over, I'll make you some kind of present to say thanks. I don't know what it'll be, but I do know it'll be awesome.
0	Hey guys, i feel really strange asking for food, because usually, I'm the person giving others food. But recently, I've came into some trouble, and now I can't even afford to feed myself.  I would really appreciate it if someone could feed me , thanks 
0	I'm home for the break, he's posting of Facebook of how he doesn't have any food. He's literally the coolest dude. I really want to help him out.   EDIT: Forgot a comma in the tittle. 
1	Its kinda hard to ask....I and my wife and 3 kids need a little help.  I lost my job and even though I got another one I dont get paid till next friday. We have been living off anything we can get.  A friend told me about this from tv. I figured I would give it a shot. Not sure how it works.  I would love to feed my kids and wife a decent meal tonight. I am not asking for charity just....well a little food.  I will return the gesture. cowman31@hotmail.com   If you need any other info feel free to email me  
0	Alternatively, I will write a poetic song about you and a hobby of yours and write music for it!
0	I've just gotten back from holiday today (Greece) which was a clusterfuck of disasters - I was robbed, my iPhone stolen and my money, and have several stitches above my eye to boot. While I was away my girlfriend had her apartment broken into by a lone male and she woke up with him assaulting her luckily she screamed and he was frightened away by her housemate running in, but it could have been a LOT worse.   she has some facial bruising and bruises to her hands, and from talking to her on the phone tonight she is pretty terrified. As a backstory, my girlfriend is from my town but is working 3500 miles away in columbus, ohio, until the end of next year, meaning I cant be there to make her feel better  &amp; thanks to my mishaps while abroad, I have no money to do anything about it and no way to talk to her other than landline calling (we've tried skype but it drops constantly - facetime is a dream come true for us but it will be around 20 days til my insurance coughs up for a replacement phone, so its going to be a nightmare until then!)  so basically I'd like some help in cheering up the poor girl. for obvious reasons giving her address out on the internet right now would be a big no-no, but i'm not sure if there is any other way to do it? if there isnt, then can someone from there give me some pointers on an online site i can order for her? i don't mind racking up some over limit fees if it comes to it &amp; last thing I want to do is come across as a scammer. (you can see I did post an askreddit about the incident yesterday, alas it didn't get a single reply! img-foreveralone).  if anyone can help, I'd really appreciate it. Thanks
1	never thought I'd be here doin this, but I am broke, not feelin well, and very hungry.  I would love to return the favor next month when things clear up for me!  thank you so much for considering helpin me out
0	dropped my phone in the mop bucket today and the only number I remember is not around
0	Please donate some pizza to occupy SD at the civic center. There is a lot of people here who can use a meal. Many of the protesterw are people who have lost their jobs and have been laid off. It would be great to get some delicious pies for the hUngry mouths. 
1	Craigslist and bike riding the past three days and im just hungry! Help me out please? Pics will be provided!
0	Haven't done this before, won't pull at your heartstrings. What I will say is that i haven't eaten anything since Friday, I have no food in and no money to buy any. If anyone feels like helping a brother out, it would be much appreciated. Will happily return the favour when student loans come in in a couple of weeks.
0	We're both poor college students at Purdue, in West Lafayette, IN, and need a break from studying if some beautiful soul is kind enough. I should note that this is my first time using this, and once summer aid comes, I'm going to happily give pizzas in kind. Thanks guys!
0	I read about this website a while ago and had a little read through it, but never had the need to register. Anyway, the time has come for me to make a post.  I just moved into a small new flat with my Mum, after my brother died recently and she couldn't afford to keep paying the mortgage for our old house. Everything is pretty much still in boxes and all the cupboards are empty, so my Mum has been leaving me money or a sandwich from Tesco or something to keep me going. We had an argument last night because she was drunk and she promised she would stop drinking, and when I woke up this morning she hadn't left any money or food, so I have nothing to eat all day long. I have no money (the wallet was a figure of speech - I don't have a wallet!) at all, not even £1 to go and get something cheap from Tesco. I woke up early this morning due to being hungry.  I am embarrassed to post on here so I hope I haven't done this in vain, someone please help me out. Thank you in advance.  P.S. I'm in the UK
0	I just moved to Winston-Salem from Jacksonville (NC) to start a new job, but I don't get my first paycheck until Friday.   The process of moving has be financially tapped out (between my last rent payment in Jacksonville, and having to pay first month's rent and security deposit up here, all I have in the kitchen is a loaf of bread and PB &amp; J).  I have weighed the pro's and con's of sucking dick for a pepperoni pizza, but I thought I would try here first.
1	My baby and I havent had anything to eat and Im so hungry and shes been crying all day. Im doing my best to cheer her up but we could really use some food in our tummies. Thank you! God bless!  heres a photo of us http://imageshack.us/f/854/babymama.jpg/   THANK YOU SO MUCH EVERYONE. I AM GOING TO BE OK!!! THANK YOU REDDIT!
0	Hello! :)  My roommate is a 19-year old college student who has a beautiful baby girl (who was born while he was still in high school).  The mother is a year younger and takes care of her while he is at our apartment for university - but he heard today that his baby is sick and in the hospital.  He can't miss class, so he's stuck hours away from his baby in our apartment worried sick.  In addition, while riding on a bus to class, he took his keys out (it was about to storm) and put them in his hands to get into his car immediately after exiting the bus.  He left the bus, but apparently forgot his keys, and had to wait outside as it stormed for the bus to loop around (takes anywhere from 20 minutes to 45), then found out that the keys somehow made their way onto ANOTHER BUS, so he had to go back to campus, chase down the bus they were on, and finally get home.  All during a storm.  I'm broke for a few days until I get some money, and I'll definitely pay it forward down the line when I have some money to spend, but if someone could spare a few dollars and help get my roommate's week back on track, I'd love you forever.  EDIT: We live in Baton Rouge, Louisiana
0	So, in light of the article that has been floating around here, I feel kind of timid about putting this out there, but I guess I have nothing to lose at this point. In the past, he has searched my reddit history and scolded me for things I posted, etc., but I know that a throwaway won't be acknowledged, so I guess I'll take my chances on him getting mad about this.  I've been in an emotionally abusive relationship for quite some time, and it has been absolutely wrecking my sense of self/sanity.   This weekend, we were supposed to go to his family's cabin, and over the course of the week there were many , "well, I'm going alone!" and "I want you to come with, baby" moments.  That is probably the tamest and most concise way to tell the story.  Last night, he was shining a flashlight repeatedly, directly in my eyes, to try and make me go to bed with him, if that gives any insight.  I am proud of myself for deciding not to go with him this weekend, even if we were on a "high" this afternoon.   I am moving out the first of August, and am trying desperately to save money for my security deposit/first month's rent. To be honest, I was looking forward to free meals with his family, but I decided it wasn't worth it.  The icing on the cake is that I'm one of those people who doesn't eat when they're stressed out, so right now it's just me, a box of wine, and whatever I ate yesterday hanging out in the house.  Logic tells me I should eat.   Anyone?  I would absolutely love to pay it forward when I have my feet on the ground. 
0	Hi,  I'm down to $2.45 in bank account exactly and eating oatmeal and hungry jack pancake mix to get through November. Would REALLY really appreciate a pizza as it is my favorite food. I'm a hard working young woman just have a rough month ahead of me.   Thank You. 
0	Hi, no sob story for ya... thought i would ask for fun! i'm stuck at work until 1am - had my coffee and thought a pizza would be nice.
0	Just got out of college for the summer, sleeping on a buddies couch because i wont have a bed/room untill wednesday. Neither him nor I have much money, would really appreciate.

0	I was doing the keto diet for about a month and a half and lost about 20 lbs. I fell of the wagon about two weeks ago and while I haven't put any weight back on, I've stalled the weight loss.   I'm starting again tomorrow and I'm craving pizza like crazy but it's not in the budget.  If anyone is curious about the keto diet check out /r/keto its awesome!  Oh and I'm in MN USA  Thanks!
1	I would love to give pizza to the family but our funds are very limited for the next month.  We have food in the fridge but there's not a whole ton and we don't get our food stamps until tomorrow.  They don't know I'm doing this but I thought it'd be a lovely surprise if pizza was presented!
0	So I'm down to just peanut butter and eggs until Friday(Payday) and it gets really boring. I'll send a picture of me and my roomie doing a hand stand for the first person willing to get us some sweet sweet Za
0	I haven't had a job in a about a year and it has put a strain on my relishionship with my long time GF. It also put us i a lot of debt. Along with losing our house. I just got a job that will fix most of the problems, and we wanted to celebrate.   Waxahachie, tx
0	Hey I would so grateful for a pizza right now. I am out of food at the moment, not even ramen left, and my pay check isn't coming till Wednesday due to labor day weekend. I have some tests I am studying for right now, I am in Rochester NY. 
0	I made a post before about my situation with my ex. Well, I had to use my entire check just to keep a roof over my head and the lights on. I work for walmart. Next paycheck is May 23. I ate my last pack of Ramen last night before work. Anything would be greatly appreciated and I'd owe you immensely.  Reddit, care to help a 22 year old down on his luck? (more like out of luck, or at least good luck) Thank you for  reading even if you can't send anything. It's the thought that counts.   **REQUEST HAS BEEN ANSWERED BY THE GUY BELOW. FUCKIN SAINT RIGHT THERE!**
1	I am just now finding this subreddit and boy did it come at the perfect time. At the beginning of the month, my father passed away, leaving my husband and I to beg off family to pay for the plane ticket to Texas. Worth it to say goodbye to my daddy, but still horrible. When we got back my husband discovered he was not being hired as a teacher at the school he worked at for the following year because he wasn't catholic enough (yes, it was a Catholic school board). This after two years of working for this board, being an active member of the school community, and being loved by all of the students and their parents. He was devastated. Right now he is sitting at the kitchen table filling out application after application... We have $20 inour bank account and his last paycheck, coming in two weeks has to be spent for our big move to Toronto in a month. I am unemployed (I'm immigrating to Canada and they haven't issued a work visa yet) and just want to see my husband have something super neat and nice happen. Earlier he came into the room and said he wished we could order a pizza... Half an hour later I found this!  I'm willing to provide any proof you ask for and as soon as we are on our feet again I wOuld love to return the favor! Is there anyone willing to give a random act of pizza to a couple looking to smile at least once this month?!  UPDATE: Dinner box arrived! Here are some pictures of my husband and I with our amazing treat from Belgar! My husband was so freakin' surprised! It was awesome! So thank you for totally making out evening!! Also, sorry if I'm doing this wrong!!  http://imgur.com/9BPcd  Seriously, best meal I've had in awhile! :D http://i.imgur.com/VVWEJ.jpg
1	Well the ticket is IMO total bs (it looks like I come to a full stop to me in the little grainy video) but I have to pay it, according to the ticket I did not come to a complete stop while making a right on red. Pretty crappy mood about it and was poor before having to pay it. Pizza is my comfort food. Also there's that email from PJ's that says if I order more than $10 I'll get 25 papa points, that would make this week not so shitty. I thank anyone for considering my request.
0	I might not have the money to go back home for Christmas. A pizza would definitely cheer me up.
0	I'll survive the night, but it won't be pretty. I think I can see my heart beating through my ribcage. Is that normal?   I have a Dominos, Little Cesars, and Hungry Howie's in town. 
0	I don't get to see my dad very much, because my parents are divorced. He usually makes spaghetti or fried chicken for dinner when I am with him. Would love to have some pizza with him tomorrow night.
1	&lt;div class="sob-story"&gt;  So I've been unemployed for awhile now but doing what I need to to make things work and not trying to make it anyone else's problem, got some things going to try to help get me some kind of income going in the meantime. Went to meet someone to sell an item and ended up turning back because they messaged that their car broke down. No big deal, stuff happens. Went to HEB to get some milk and bread, basic staple stuff. Card declined. Try again. Declined again. Insert sinking feeling here. Try once more as credit. No dice. So I left empty handed. Get home and check the bank account to see what has happened, because I had at least $20 to my name. Nope. I'm now negative almost $200 due to a payment I wasn't aware was hitting today. Fantastic.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Now, I have food, it's just not anything special (ramen, pasta, rice). That said, I would much rather people more needy than I get pizza'd. But if someone felt like helping a guy not feel like he's at the bottom of a dry well, I'd be quite thankful.  &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="TL;DR"&gt;  Tried to buy basic foodstuffs, bank account surprise-buttsex, feels bad man.  &lt;/div&gt;
1	I've been pretty discouraged this week in terms of finding employment, monetary problems, health issue and so on. I'm a bit too self conscious to really dig into it but if you need proof of my lack-of-funds, I'd be more than willing to provide that for you.  In this request, I hope for more than pizza but the kindness of a stranger to help me lift my spirits during my time of need by filling an empty belly. This is a hard time in my life but I'm hoping this request will help things turn around! :)
0	Hi RAOP! I heard of this website through wishuponahero.com and was hoping I could get a lil help tonight for myself and my boys. I have been working PT and taking care of my fiancee and four boys n house FT. I finally got sick and went ot the drs today. I have an upper respitory infection and post nasal drip. Im hoping for a pizza hero for tonight. I work at the dominos in town and know that they are having two or more 2 topping pizzas for 5.99 each. I would need at least 3 since my boys eat like garbage disposals lol. any help would be awesome. thank you. oh and i did that get verified thing and have a code from it.
1	Would like to surprise my son.  :)
0	Hello, right now I have my newborn daughter in my left arm as I type this with my right. If released even for a moment she will start screaming very loudly for a twelve-day-old person.   I would like to humbly submit my request for a free pizza. Cooking a meal has been...difficult shall we say and both my wife and I are very tired of Ramen Noodles and Lean Cuisine.  I know Papa John's has a deal this weekend but Dominos is the only place that delivers to my address in my area.   Thank you in advance!
0	Started studying in December for my Design and Pricing actuarial exams. Results came out Friday. I scored a 5 and the pass mark is a 6. Due to the way they're changing the exam requirements, this means I'll have an extra year (at least) before I finish exams.
1	I don't have much to offer but if you can help me out I'll owe you big. My stomach is growling I have some water and about 2 dollars in change. This pizza would last me a few days until my check comes in. 
0	Hey RAOP! I have been broke for the past few weeks with roughly .30 cents in my bank account and have been eating nothing but rice and noodles for the past week. Would be awesome if I can enjoy a pizza tonight. Thanks!
0	Last night my friend had a date with a girl. Naturally he wasn't prepared, and I went to his house to clean it. Messy as all hell, had to vacuum and pick up a lot of trash. Had to buy drinks too since there weren't any and condoms. Long story short my friend doesn't close. Turns her down and wants to "Take it slow."   Now I'm broke and hungry, just want a pizza or something, haven't eaten all day. 
0	This is my first RAoP post, so I don't really know what else to say...Guess I'll start here: I moved to Philadelphia in August and got a job at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, but I got laid off right before Thanksgiving because of over-hiring. I've yet to get any good reception from the places I've applied at, its at the point where all I have to eat right now is ramen and stale Tostitos. I tried filing for unemployment but since I'm not yet a PA resident (originally from South Jersey) I'm ineligible.   My roommates have been giving me food but I feel bad mooching off of them for so long, and I'd like to be able to give them some food for a change. That's where you guys come in.   Well, that's about it. Thanks for reading.
1	I've been living off peanut butter for almost a week now. Times are very tough and I'm just hoping someone has some money to spare for a pizza. I just found this site and I love the idea of people helping people. If you have and can help out, please do.
0	After being unemployed since June, I finally started a new job three weeks ago. The job is great except for they didn't key in my time worked my first week. So I won't be paid for another two weeks. During my time of unemployment I began taking care of two of my siblings, which caused me to go through my savings faster than I would have. Now I'm at the end of the road and really have to make eveything last these next two weeks.   I would really appreciate a pizza to help us a long and would be a nice surprise for them. I will definitely pay it back/foward as soon as I can. Thanks!
1	Hey there.  I've been struggling the past few months but this week has been a little rougher than most.  A check I was expecting from a temp job I had worked was lost in the mail and it sounds like I won't receive the reissued one until later this week or early next week.  My bank account is looking real sad right now and I've used up the last bit of my spare change to cover transit fare.  I've been eating a lot of rice and ramen but some pizza would be really nice if anyone could help.  Thanks for reading :)
1	I've been pretty much struggling with money this year, my already small loan was reduced, the money I had saved from summer didn't go far as a lot of it had to step in to cover the shortfall in my rent and the part time job market sucks.  So toward the end of this year I've been selling stuff to make ends meet. I sold an effects pedal last week for £30 thinking I would budget £10 a week for food to last me.  Now I get an interview for a job back in my home town and I had to spend the next 2 weeks food money on tickets to go to it. I've got rice, butter and frozen peas, but I'd sure like something more substantial if a redditor was kind enough to help a brother out?
0	Every day we eat peanut butter sandwiches, cheapest of the cheap hot dogs, ramen noodles or rice. We are currently about to walk (no car --long story of bad luck) over two miles in 95 degree weather to overdraft our $8 balance bank account in order to buy food for the week. I'm the last person who would ever ask for anything, and perhaps that is why we have lived in such rough shape for so long, but I figured I would give it a shot. Maybe it will delay another day and something will come along. Thanks in advance for helping us, or for any who considered..  UPDATE: People are amazing. We have had some wonderful people offer us assistance. Thank you to those who have helped and those who have offered. We received a Random act of Dominos from the one and only flamingcow. We also will be receiving a grocery gift card soon from another wonderful person. Again, we're taken back by the generosity. We're not used to receiving such gifts. There are amazingly good people out there.  P.S. - I can only hope that we can be as generous to others once things have turned around for us.  MORE EDITS: Wow people have been generous to us, we just got another gift of Pizza Hut today completely unexpected! Thank you very much! (I'm not sure if they want to be named publicly so I won't do so unless I have their permission). We can't wait to be good enough financially to be able to give the gift of pizza/food to others in need in the future!
0	I asked for help in r/assistance and someone was kind enough to give me $45 for help on my credit card a week ago. Now I'm out of groceries and  the credit card bill is getting dangerously higher. This pizza would GREATLY help me out.  I'll pay it forward as soon as I start getting my steady income back!  Edit:  dontlikerainbows helped me out! I now have food to tide me over until Tuesday!
0	I'm a little short on cash this week, or I'd buy it myself.
0	This may seem like a strange request, but there's only one place that delivers to where I am in SF and my phone isn't working and they don't have online ordering for where I am. If anyone could help me to order pizza, I would be immensely grateful   Edit: many thanks to MusicsFan!
0	Hello, I am 24 years old, I am a full time worker, a full time college student, and i live all on my own, not easy to do but i manage. Its the end of finals I am broke, at home with pink eye, so i can't work today (not my choice) and i'm broke. I would really like some pizza. If any of you can help me i would be extremley grateful. Thank you.
0	Long time reader, first time poster.  Forgive me if there's a better place for this, but I thought I'd try here.  I'm a divorced dad with limited funds.  The ex is remarried and in a better financial place.  Not trying to compete with her, but I hate always telling the kids we can't go out to eat.  I have $60 in Fandango cash that I basically have nothing to do with right now.  The kids and I have seen what we're going to see until the summer, and I figured maybe I could trade it for a gift card somewhere.  As I said, I've followed this site for a long time, but I've always been too proud to ask for help.  This way I figure I'm not taking a handout.  What I'm hoping is to get 2 $25 gift cards, and I would give $30 in movie cash for each one.  If you're not familiar with Fandango cash, you can use it at any theater that accepts fandango, and it never expires.  You can look on Fandango.com for more info.    I know there are a lot of great people on here, and I'm hoping some of them would enjoy going to the movies :)  Have a great day!
0	Been out of work, had a job interview today... didn't go so well. It was for a translation job basically, got there and found out the hard way that they are only seeking someone who can read Traditional Chinese fluently.  I only read Simplified Chinese. Whoops. I walked in, felt really good, but then that happened... Just feel kinda dumb. Didn't even let me speak to an interviewer or anything, threw my papers from the translation test away XD.  Can I get a pizza? I was counting on getting a free one from Domino's but they ended that promo and now I'm screwed XD. Pizza or no, any cheerful comments would be appreciated as well :)
0	I am a single mother of 2 who recently just took in my Brother and his family (wife &amp; son). My brother was in the USMC and got out early due to medical issues and we figured we could make it work, but unfortunatly due to the economy he has had a difficult time finding a new job and we are all trying to survive on my salary alone. He did take AND pass his postal exam yesterday so please pray for us that this leads to something great. If anyone could find it in their hearts to help us out a little it would be greatly appreciated.also if you need any other information in regards to this situation or would like a verification code please message me. Thank you for taking the time to read this &amp; God Bless
0	Austin, TX   We get paid Friday and I think my kids will attack me if we eat peanut butter or spaghetti one more time. We aren't usually quite this broke but a poorly planned move and we are on our last dimes for two more days. Please, sir, may I have some moar pizza?  Edit: Aw geez. I forgot to say where I am.
0	Hi there, I'm broke right now and I don't have much food here. I have some chicken broth, an onion and some croutons. I'm thinking a pizza may sound better and then when I get paid on friday I would love to pay it forward to someone else who needs a pizza. Thanks :)
0	No job and living with two other roommates. Both of them are away at the moment. One on Navy duty, the other has a death in the family and is out of state. Ran out of ramen today, would love a pizza to tide me by. Thanks.
0	I'm in Australia (Sydney) and am v hungry! I've opened my own counselling/psychotherapy business which I'm so passionate about. I love helping people. This has meant that I've spent all my money. I'm sure it will all be worth it but in the meantime I'm scraping by on next to no money.  I've finally been on Reddit for a month which I think makes me eligible.    I too would love to take part in offering pizza once I'm financially on my feet again.   Thank you so much to who ever even considers feeding me!
0	No sad story or anything, just a broke college student (I have a part time job but most of the money goes to paying rent/food and paying down student loans early) who would love some pizza for dinner tonight. It is either the pizza or Cheerios with no milk for dinner. Help me out with either papa johns or dominos.  If someone gives me a papajohns gift card, I will use code that gives you the free pizza with an order of $10 and pay it forward in this subreddit tomorrow night!  THANK YOU!!!
1	Received an egift from a person who wishes to stay anonymous thank you so much for helping my family.
0	Just yesterday my bank found fraud activity on my debit card, and shut it down. I won't get another for 5-7 business days, and since I have no cash on hand, no food in the fridge and no nearby bank office, I'm going a bit hungry.  If someone helps me out now, I hope to return the favor once I get my new card by providing a RAOP myself.   Thanks in advance.
1	I have bad luck. Not just any bad luck, but the kind of bad luck that comes from a) either trying to be a good person and help people out or b) the kind of stupidity that can only result from people taking advantage of you.   About three months ago, we opened our house to a 19-year-old girl who, along with her mother, made a verbal agreement to pay 1/3rd of the bills in exchange for living in the smaller bedroom. She was very excited and "needed" to move out of her mother's house.   Unfortunately, this girl and her mother conned us for all we had. Being unemployed undergraduate students, we didn't have any money put aside for "extras" in the first place, and this girl failed to pay half of her rent for April, all of her rent for June, and all of her rent (plus a late fee!) for July, even after setting up a "payment plan" with apartment management with the expectation of paying it. She has since moved out, but not after stealing all of our food, some of our possessions, and most of our dignity.   Apartment management refuses to accept that this girl still has a legal obligation for her portion of the rent as she has NOT been signed off the lease, and consequently, I have been forced to pay her rent for the last three months. She owes me nearly 700 dollars, and though I have taken her to the DA for the bad check she's written me, there is a high possibility that I will not be able to afford fees for small claims court to claim anything other than the 250 dollar check she wrote me, with intentional fraud.   She still has two keys to our apartment, so we barricade the door every night because we're afraid she will come back and steal more of our food or belongings.   Every word this girl has told us is a lie and she has robbed our home of happiness, trust, and most of all, security. We were very nearly evicted last month because of her lies (she waited until the 22nd to "pay" her rent and when I'd gone in the next morning to make sure she had, she had not. I was stuck paying it or being evicted.) And now, because of having to pay her rent for the last three months, I may end up evicted within the next few weeks because I do not have enough money to make it.   My parents have offered to help as much as they can, but frankly, I'm 22 years old and I feel like a loser for living off of my parents when I've been somewhat independent for the last year.  My history is about as bleak: I was homeless over Christmas the last few years, I lived with my sister after that while taking out nearly 10,000 dollars in student loans just for living expenses. The idea that I will be paying off these last three years of my life for the next 50 is sickening to me. I have not been able to go grocery shopping in the last three months; our food reserves are down to nothing because of our roommate's dishonesty and stealing, and we really have no food left. Recently, I was in a vehicle accident that left me with a large gash in my hand and a damaged tendon, and over 1,000 dollars in ER bills which I am unable to pay.  I have applied for assistance and food stamps, but have been denied because I am a student, and my current job which I just picked up at Hometown Buffet (seriously probably the worst job I've ever had) will not consistently give me 20 hours a week, despite having promised me 40 hour weeks when they hired me. This week, I have been awarded six hours of undeniable hell, and yet I have tried to be the best employee I can be because, well, I consider myself lucky I even have a job.   In August, I may be able to receive food stamps due to being a federal work-study recipient, but that is only if I can find a work-study job, which is very limited. I do not know that my income will continue to support my rent or bills, let alone my boyfriend (who is STILL unemployed, I've come to learn that our town/state both have DOUBLE the unemployment rates of most other towns/states.) and because I am not yet 24, my parents are expected to contribute 10,000 dollars yearly to my education and I may not even be able to attend college because they simply cannot give me that kind of money. As it is, the help they are offering me at the moment is limited and I feel guilty that they even think they can manage to support themselves and me.   The financial aid and government assistance system simply does not take people like me into account. I try hard, I love fiercely, and I am responsible. I am not getting married to cheat the financial aid system. I am not getting pregnant in order to receive welfare or food stamps or WIC. I am two years away from a Bachelor's degree in a field where I will probably have to relocate thousands of miles away from my hometown simply to find work. I get great grades, I never miss work or a class, and yet... I can't do it on my own.   Just recently, I've learned that I have diabetes because I have not been able to afford nutritious food or been able to eat more than once a day, causing my insulin production to skyrocket. I spend a large portion of my days, when not working, asleep because high blood sugar levels and hunger cause me to feel incredibly weak. I don't have medical insurance to help me through this at the moment, because the Medi-cal budget is being cut and my paperwork is still in the processing stage following my accident last month.   It is the first of July, and I know someone who is diabetic should not be asking for pizza, but dammit, I'm hungry and my boyfriend's birthday was two days ago, and I haven't been able to give him anything. I don't know what I can offer in prove aside from pictures of my puppy-dog stare, empty pantry, and medical bills, but really, I just want a freakin' pizza and the inevitable food-coma that will come afterwards.   With vegetables on it. I've learned, as a child you never want to eat your vegetables, as an adult who cant afford food, you miss them more than anything.   By the way: this website gives me so much hope, I could burst. I spent hours yesterday and today reading posts before I even signed up for a name and got the balls to make one myself. &lt;3   EDIT: I am going to school for graphic design, I don't know much about reddit yet but if you want a graphic made for you to display, I'd be happy to do it in a repayment of faith and support for RAOP members. :) 
1	I am a mythical creature and I've got a giant sized craving for some pizza! Actually I'm just a man, but the part about the giant sized craving is true. So if it be in your heart to randomly buy some poor stranger a pizza, let it be me.   Thank you! I am yours sincerely, Witherwings
0	(Sorry, I didn't put my location in before)  Well, I had some unexpected finance troubles (who doesn't! ) and I'm out of luck (and have been for a couple days) food-wise until I get paid on Monday. Whether or not this works, I'll be back next week to do this for someone! Thanks in advance for reading and enjoy your weekend everyone! :)
1	So it's the superbowl, I got no friends where I live, I am stuck at home with a broken down vehicle anyway. All I have left in the pantry till tomorrow night is crackers. A pizza would just make my day!
0	Trying to save a couple of bucks by not going anywhere cool for spring break, and missing home (which is in California, and I'm in Pittsburgh). Pizza would be pretty cool, just thought I'd ask!
1	To say the least I have had a very long bad day. My Dad was sent to the ER today, and being the oldest kid I'm the one who is in charge of keeping the family together and calm. I'd like to help calm everyone down with some comfort food (like a pizza), but can't afford to do so.   I know there are plenty of people who need a pizza on here way more than I do, so please help those in need first. I'd just like to give my mom a break and surprise her and my family with some pizza from a stranger. It would def lift our spirits.
1	Today is going to be a very long day at work and I am not sure I will be able to leave to get lunch.... does someone want to send me a cheese pizza :)
0	I have a copy of train simulator I can gift on steam, anybody wanna trade me a pizza for it? XD
1	hey raop...i already rec'd the hookup earlier last week before moving.  i was hoping that someone out there could hook up another pizza tonight.  we moved all weekend, and are tapped out until snap benefits hit on the 9th.  after i a job i'll be glad to pay it back or pay it forward.  i need to feed myself, my girlfriend, and of course the two cats love scraps of ham off the pizza.  edit: oh yeah i forgot, western ky here!  help a hillbilly out, ya'll!  UPDATE: om nom!  thanks to sbrinkley1104 me and mine are eating hot fresh pizza tonight!  thanks ya'll
0	IDK what to write here.
0	Hi guys. I'm home for the weekend with my siblings and tonight I have to babysit them both. It would mean everything to me of I could show them that I'm still fun like I was before I was broke and still living at home with them. Pictures of smiling faces would happily be uploaded as proof :) Thank you so much to anyone that can manage to help out with a surprise pizza
0	Today has sucked a lot.  Sitting alone in my apartment while my family goes on vacation - I need to stay available in case I need to go in for a second job interview, so I couldn't go.  Money's been tight.  I got Netflix recently and the free month just expired the other day.  Just by coincidence, my bank charged me an 8.00 monthly fee for being poor the day I signed up.  I thought it was Netflix charging me by mistake - but this brought my account pretty low, so when the charge for the first month hit, it resulted in overdraft.  Didn't know this until I called my bank.  So I got charged money for being poor...and then got charged more money for not having enough money, though I would have survived the second charge if not for the first.  Hope this doesn't come off as whiny.  I know other people have it way worse, and this is clearly a firstworldproblems kind of thing.  Still, it's only 12:30 and I'm lonely, depressed, and broke.  A pizza would go a long way toward lifting my spirits.  Edit:  Forgot a general location - I live in the U.S.; southern Louisiana, specifically.
0	my family is away on vacation. I have three dollars to my name and no license.  basically broke, hungry staying in on a saturday.  If anyone one would like to buy me pizza I would be sure to pass it on sometime later this week.
0	I'm a student, and my fridge is empty. I would normally bike to the store and buy groceries for the week, but somehow I misplaced my debit card, and I don't have enough cash to feed myself.  I would really appreciate a pizza until I can get to the bank tomorrow. I get my paycheck early next week, so I can pay it forward then. : )
1	That's about it, I suppose. My wife fortunately makes enough for us to scrape by but treats are rare these days.  EDIT: ~~I PMed azzip_oAR as requested and sent him my email. He says he sent me a Dominoes gift thingy via e-mail but that was 30 minutes ago and it hasn't showed up in my inbox, should it take that long?~~  EDIT2: [YES, IT SOMETIMES TAKES AWHILE.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/huz3x/request_laid_off_for_a_few_months_now_not/c1ylhbj)   Thanks to azzip_oAR and everyone else here, this rocks.
1	I haven't had a pizza in months and I currently have -$9 in the bank :c I haven't had any sign of my financial aid showing up yet, and I'm starving!  In return I'd gladly draw anything you'd wish  Here's some of my digital art as an example: http://imgur.com/a/ehpgm  *edit: just fixing formatting because mobile can be wonky at times
0	I'm hungry got no food will trade portal 2 coupoun for pizza we have a papa johns in town please raop help me
0	Hello, people.   I was just told about this subreddit by a friend after venting to him about this evenings biggest annoyance. I've taken part in pizza sharing things before, I just honestly never knew there was a subreddit for it. My favourite time anything like that happened was this one time me and a friend spent _forever_ calling anywhere we could find in this small Czech town, trying to order pizza for a mutual friend we knew online, but that's a long and HILARIOUS tale involving calling the _Mayor_ even, and I'll gladly share it if folk want to hear it.  Anyway, my issue, sob story, whatever you wanna call it.  Basically I live with a flatmate in a really crappy part of the northwest UK, and this guy I share my space with is a presumptuous ass. It's not uncommon to find he's 'borrowed' something of mine, not cleaned after himself if he used the kitchen/bathroom/toilet/anything, and a favourite trick of his seems to be eating my food when he thinks I'm not in or asleep.  That happened tonight. I come in from a day out with family and open the fridge, I'd been planning on making a veritable bathtub full of chilli to eat and freeze in for the next few days until my payday, however tonight I get to learn that he's had company over and guess what he made for these upstanding citizens! He basically used _everything_ I had left, _everything_, to feed his drugdealer friends as they came over to smoke weed, be loud, and play/watch whatever happens to be ridiculously loud in the next room over. One pointless shouting match later I'm sat here tired, wet, and hungry enough that I'd happily eat my bed. Spoke with the family I _just_ came from about this and I'm invited back over for dinner on Friday, the day prior to my payday. Still leaves me foodless tonight and tomorrow, though, and a friend pointed me here. I already said that. Um.  I've no idea of etiquette here, I've no idea if I said too little or not enough, but hey there's my request. I will say though that I'm probably gonna stick around here, and will definitely pass on the favour to somebody elses request once I'm paid. Share the love and such.
0	Hey Reddit.  I've never had to do this before and it's pretty embarrassing.  I literally have just change in my bank account and don't get paid again until Friday.  I figure if I find someone nice enough to send me a pizza, I could have a slice tonight and lunch and meals for a few days.  I'd greatly appreciate it and you have my word, on Friday this week I'll put in a post to pay it back.  I have a real reddit name of over 2 years this is just a throw away because I'm too embarrassed.  Thanks guys!!  Doh! Never done this before.  I'm in MD.  Sorry it's not in the title!
0	Title says it. Really jonesing for a pizza while we chat about the future and money problems. A little something to brighten up the mood. 
0	Been battling substance abuse for sometime, having some of the usual ups and downs. Can't manage to stay clean longer then a few months. Considering heading back to rehab, which is really scary. Boyfriend dumped me two weeks ago, he's dating a girl I thought was my friend, and they apparently have been in love for quite awhile now.   Working two jobs has got me drained...and I really don't want to cook tonight.   Thanks for reading. =]  I live in the southern US.
1	My small family of myself, my wife, and our two kids are ecstatic today at having just landed a new job that has better pay, is a closer commute, and will finally have me working daytime hours so that I can spend more time with my family instead of *sleeping* while they're awake!  I'd love to get some pizza to celebrate with them, but our bank account currently says $0.42, which might afford me a pepperoni.  Anyone feeling like being a part of the celebration?
0	Hey guys my brother just told me about this sub, and I couldn't have heard about it at a better time.  Long story short, I don't get to eat much due to lacking money, but I was hoping yall could help me out today :)   Anyways any consideration is greatly appreciated, and my tummy will thank you himself! :D
0	Edit: adding location / California 
0	Hi there,  life is good and I have nothing to complain about. Today my mrs is going out wedding dress shopping for my upcoming Christmas wedding and I am going to sit and play GTA and have a few beers. A pizza would help make a good day great. Of course I will pass on the good Karma to a fellow RAOP user at a later date. Thanks :)
0	Too flippin hot outside to want to go anywhere (aka, i'm lazy).  Coworkers will be like "Hey, where did you get the pizza?" and I'll be all like "Yo, some bad ass mofo inside my computa bought this fo me"  Or I could respond using proper English if you prefer. Or I could dance a jig and put a slice on my head.  edit: And now its POURING outside so I REALLY don't want to go anywhere.
0	I know this is second time I requested on here, but unfortunately no such luck, so I thought i'd try again. Like it says in the title, I'm low on cash this month, and would greatly appreciate a pizza. I promise that'll come give back once I get back on my feet. 
0	Loads of work to do and I'm sat here bashing it out but so depressed that its a Friday night! Pizza/motivation greatly appreciated :)
0	My word count has stalled and I'm getting grumpy. Some pizza would really cheer me up!
1	After a lengthy conversation with my financial aid office, I have found out I will be receiving little to no benefit whatsoever from my school that aren't loans (this is actually a pretty big deal for me, personally) and for the summer I have no access to loans so I'm without any money after rent goes through. Some pizza would be **damn** good right about now. I'm in Irvine, CA if someone would be so kind :)
0	Not the best week as you can see from the title. Money stresses making my relationships fall apart and struggling to get back on my feet. Pizza would not only cheer me up but fill my belly. Any help is appreciated : )
1	Hiya.  I needed a new place to live as of August 1st and have just paid my first/last and security deposit on it. I, unfortunately, don't get paid until Tuesday the 31st, and am down to 5 packages of ramen, and a jar of raspberry jam (and coffee).  Let's be friends? I'll buy you one next month. :D
0	I'm tired of eating canned stuff, bologna and cereal. Can I get a pizza guys? :) 
1	Feeling under the weather so I called out off work today! I hate requesting because I feel like I'm begging so I thought I'd give back!   (I'd offer pizza if today were payday :C)
0	Ive spent most of the weekend in bed with strep throat. I cant afford the doctor so I'm eating expired antibiotics a friend found in their medicine cabinet. Anything would help.... 
1	My 5-year-old son and I will be home alone tonight, no Gigi or Papa or Daddy, and we can't afford pizza or any special groceries, so it'd be super awesome if I could surprise him with a nice, warm night inside with games, cartoons, and pizza. It would really make our day! :)
1	My fiancée is very hungry. She has had a really bad day at work. I want to be able to have something for her to be able to come home to that's good to eat, and be able to cheer her up. We're both beyond broke and no food left in our house.    We won't get paid again for another two weeks. We both work part time and living paycheck to paycheck right now. Trying to get back on track with our bills after I'd been out of work for close to two months. I'm hoping to be getting a second job as soon as I can get the call back to start. Catching up on our bills has left us completely broke.   I was wanting to try to get us a large pizza. Her favorite is Meat Lovers, but we'd greatly appreciate any kind. We live in Kentucky. As soon as we can get back on our feet, I promise to pay this forward and help someone that is in the same dire straits that we are currently going through.     
1	I won my first free pizza from here the other day, but the person couldn't get any of the gift cards to go through. I was really dissapointed, so I though maybe another kind soul could cheer me up. I can give you proof of the situation as well, in case you don't believe me.
0	Nothing special here, just haven't had enough money to even buy ramen noodles for the past 2 days and won't be able to eat until I get my paycheck on Friday. Any help whatsoever would be appreciated, even if it's just a link to a coupon for canned beans :P I am in the DC Area. 
0	I've got a killer headache from working on college shit all day (and the minecraft pre-release). Anyone care to send a pizza my way so I don't have to bother with cooking?  Coalton, Ohio.
0	No lie filled story. I'm hungry. And would love a pizza. I have made it easy.  https://order.zonicordering.com/MzYyNDY%3d.whtml?str=mountain-mikes-pizza-el-dorado-hills
0	So after my bf shattered his ankle this morning we had to go to the ER and pay for the visit the xrays the crutches and the pain meds. After all that we are now dead broke and I don't get paid until Friday, would love some nice yummy pizza for the night!
0	A delivery driver was shot and killed while approaching someone stealing from coworkers cars: http://www.wthr.com/story/15957703/pizza-delivery-driver-shot-in-bloomington  I've never been on this subreddit before but I figured this was appropriate to link, and since that location is offering all proceeds to go to the family of the deceased( http://www.facebook.com/pages/Pizza-X/82904137667 ) I figured RAoP might be interested. There is nothing in it for me: I do not know the individual/family of the deceased, but I am from Bloomington and felt like outreach might be appreciated by his surviving family. 
1	I have 5 boys for the weekend and cash is running low. Would love to give them a pizza party tonight with your help of course ;) We have dominos and pizza hut that deliver to our home  Thanks in advance.
0	Broke, pregnant and hungry. We won't get foodstamps till the 4th. Would be awesome to get a pizza or two.   Thanks guys!
0	I tried posting on here last night but it doesn't look like my post made it onto the site. Rather than write it all out again I'll sum it up as best I can.  My hubby of nearly ten years spent the money my mother gave us for food on beer and cigarettes, so since last night he's been booted out of the house by yours truly. Not sure when I'll let him back in but I intend to stay mad for quite a while. It got down into the 40's last night so I reckon he's definitely regretting his decision about now.  Thankfully he at least got food for the dog so that's one less thing to worry about, but I don't get paid until Monday and that money was supposed to help us make it to then. Right now my fridge is barren, all I have is half a jar of really old pickles.  I ended up taking the day off work today. I'm hungry, angry, upset, not really good for much of anything. I need something to eat, hopefully something that will last a day or two or three. Monday is quite a ways to go without something in my stomach.
0	hey, my sister just turned 15 and her birthday didnt really go so well and was upset, it would be great if you guys sent her a pizza to cheer her up, and knowing it came from a reddit user would be even greater :D
1	Money is tight and I live in Boerne where there is like no pizza! Please be nice, and help a girl out. BTW, I love this subreddit!
0	It's just been a shitty month. Been broke since I had to drive down to my sister's funeral. Was fired because it took me week of being stuck in MS with car toubles before I got back. Had to give my cat away because i can't afford to keep him. His name was Clegg and he was pretty much my best friend. And my real life best friend is moving away tomorrow. I hate giving a sob story, but i'm just really really down and hungry. please help. Thank you reddit.
1	Money is scarce this time of year. I've had a lot come up recently, including gallbladder removal. Since then, I haven't attempted fatty, greasy nor cheesy foods because I'd feared for the reaction my body may have, but I'm not sure what else I could request aside from pizza. Money is super tight at the moment and I just can't spare the money to purchase much in terms of food until Wednesday. I made a request on Monday that went without a response and I deleted it. I wasn't aware that was a bannable offense, but learned so from the RAOP chat! Just wanted to bring that to light!  Thank you for your consideration!!!
0	Details: http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/hwx1t/i_have_084_500g_of_rice_4_cups_of_flour_50g_of/  That is all I have for the next 11 Days.   Any help appreciated.  I am in New Zealand, unfortunately. In the Wellington area.
0	I have no noble cause to rally any givers to. I am not in absolute need, but I am completely broke and in debt, with a somewhat empty fridge. I am not starving, I have bread and canned goods. I mostly just want some pizza, because pizza is awesome and I'm hungry. Getting over a sunburn so bad I couldn't walk (swelling), if that helps.   All in all, there are better people to get pizza for. But I still want some.
0	[Long Island, new york] If someone would pull through, that would be amazing. i'm pretty much out of food/money until next wednesday.[ i'm spending the night over at my cousins friday but i have nothing to eat today or tomorrow D: just some easter candy.. lol, there are plenty of people who are in worse shape than i am but i thought i would give this a shot. thanks for reading :D    EDIT: also, i'll give you some cool TF2 stuff over steam, the only thing i have to offer :( i might have a 42 hour live card? I could mail you some xbox games like skyrim and stuff depending on your location :}
0	I'm in the US. I'd really appreciate a pizza if anyone is willing. Ramen mixed with vegetables can only taste good for so long. Thanks!
0	I just got home from work, and im broke, not even one dollar in my wallet. Im not looking for much, just enough to get me by till Sunday. I thank you all in advance
1	I can repay you with lovely services. I could of course write you a silly poem, or perhaps create a poster or book cover for you, I could record myself singing a song - very poorly I might add (So that might not be the best option) I can call you on skype and read chapters upon chapters of Fifty Shades of Grey. (That's everyone's favourite, eh?)
0	After reading some of these posts, it really warms my heart to know there are such great people out there in the world. Figured I'd throw my request out there and see what happens.  I just finished up my junior year at the University of Alabama, I'm double majoring in Marketing and Finance, so I've had to take out a whole lump of loans to pay for everything. My mom and dad help out as much as they can, but I'm the youngest of 4 and they are tapped out at this point.  I'm working as a summer intern at a local law firm, but of course they don't have to pay me anything, so I'm essentially an indentured servant to them :(  But I'll scrape by, I always have, and always will, but if anyone had it in their heart and could manage it, I would love a pizza over the weekend. I've got some girlfriends coming over, and for some reason a wine and pizza night sounds pretty great right now.  Roll Tide 
0	3 girls and one boy, and they've vocally already showed their disdain of eating the standard fare of ramen and more ramen that i always serve. 
0	I'm currently getting over being sick for the entire weekend. It doesn't help that I managed to completely screw myself over money-wise. (It's a long story of a 20 year old failing at personal finance) I'm currently spending a summer doing research at a university in Pittsburgh, but need enough money to drive back home in a week. This basically leaves me with a $0 food budget :(  If anyone is willing to help, once I get back on my feet (in 2 weeks I'll be home and get another paycheck), I'll definitely pay it forward. 
0	Hey RAoP. Long-time lurker; first-time poster.  My situation requires something kind of long-term, which I don't really expect to find online (I don't want to be over-reliant on the community; you guys are great) but which I hope to... figure out fairly soon. I'm disabled; receiving assistance which is pretty inadequate -- in the process of applying for more.  Anyway, all of that aside, a pizza'd go a long way toward bridging the gap this month. I'd sincerely appreciate it.
0	I'm a broke musician/artist guy. Money is (always) tight and a pie would be pretty tight butthole. Not expecting anything here, so grateful for whatever comes my way. 
0	So last night I had a study group at my house and we were all finishing up the paperwork. Things are going well and everybody was laughing and having a good time. After we finished studying, we all smoked and got lifted and watched some show on Logo (gay channel) it was funny and we all kept on laughing. Next thing we know, this female (super plus size) asked if she could grab something to eat. I said sure not thinking that she would eat ALMOST EVERY FREAKING THING IN MY FRIDGE!!!! She did and I was sooooo blown that I told her she had to go. She apologized and said that she'll pay me back later in the week. So now I'm here asking if someone can help me out with a pizza so I can eat today. I don't get paid until Wednesday so all my money is on bills and gas. Help a brother out????? 
0	Oh, and I've got dog food. Would love it if someone got me some pizza. I would appreciate it so much. 
0	Long time lurker....   So..I'm 21 years old and I've been really struggling to come up with money to eat lately. I've been trying to find jobs as much as I can but I am currently a bit stuck at home because I have gout. It has affected my left foot severely and I cannot exactly leave the house or get out as much as I need to.   Just hoping someone can help me out! I will forward the favor one day!
0	So, I'm a student in London, and it's my birthday tomorrow. I can't really afford to buy a pizza but would love one! 
0	It's been a while since I last had pizza and I would really love some. I'm located in Utah. Domino's and Pizza Hut are both close by. 
1	Normally we go out to eat but with my schooling taking up all my time/money and my fiance having recently lost his job, that's just not an option this year.  We have been struggling for a while now - you pretty much have to know someone to get a job in this tiny town (middle of nowhere Missouri).  We are living with my fiance's mom, stepdad, grandma, and sister and funds are always very limited; pizza is a huge commodity.                If someone could please help brighten up our anniversary we would be so incredibly thankful and promise to pay it forward when we're back on our feet.  I would keep it a secret from my fiance until it's ready, try to make it as fun as possible, ya know?  : )             [Here we are a year ago today!](http://imgur.com/hp7Jb)       ------------------------------       EDIT: alrightillwrite2 has been kind enough to gift us with a Papa John's gift card!!  You are the sweetest, thank you for making our anniversary special and a day to remember  : )   I *will* repay you some day, friend.
0	I'm a community college student who hasn't had a decent meal in quite some time. I've been eating two or three eggs a day all semester. (the cheapest food really, 2 1/2 dozen for about $4 at my local salvage grocery, that's about 15 cents an egg! Way cheaper and more nutritious than Ramen Noodles!) But I've only two left and after that its a cold water diet until my next paycheck in a week, which is mostly going towards rent and gas. (may have to sell this computer)  I know there are others around the world who are more in need but goodness I sure would love some pizza. As a younger kid, I took good food for granted now it has become a priority and I feel foolish for my prior attitude. If nothing else I would love some words of encouragement or anything that's ever helped you when times got tough. And, if it means anything, I will make a promise to do two Random Acts of Pizza whenever it is a little more plausible.  A big thanks to this subreddit, you guys are a real honor to the internet and the power of kindness! Keep up the good work and if you can't help me please do it for someone else as I know you will! :)
0	I have a hunger only pizza can satisfy but I'm broke as a joke right now. You are AWESOME please help me out.. 
1	As the title says. I start my first teaching job tomorrow! But until my first paycheck I don't have spending room for awesome things like pizza. I will gladly pass the favor along come first paycheck!  
0	I'm going to be up pretty late tonight, and some pizza would be wonderful in helping me get through the night. Any help is appreciated, thank you.
0	Financially-strapped student who has not eaten anything yet today and is also faced with Tesco's closure due to the holiday. I am not expecting a whole bunch but maybe there is a kind soul out there that can help me out! Thanks! 
1	oh and some taco shells, and diced tomatos... nothing much to make a meal from.  If someone would be willing to order me a pizza from any of the major chains I would be indebted to them forever &lt;3
0	I'm currently staying in a motel for a few nights while awaiting a financial aid check, thanks to an assistance program in my local town. I've been eating protein bars, and hot dogs which is what I've been able to afford cooking in a microwave. Anyways, I have class all weekend, studying really  hard and I could sooooo use a pick me up like a pizza! Being homeless has been tough, but I'm working really hard to build a better life for myself, despite a few hiccups...
0	I have four days left in this god awful Philly house and after the security deposit and first/last month rent, our bank accounts are developing cobwebs. My boyfriend and I could seriously benefit from a random act of pizza! It would probably last us about 2/3  days of dinner if we're good which is more than enough. The only one being spoiled with food in this house for the time being is the cat! Any help is well appreciated! My friend told me about RAOP today when I told him how rough its been lately and that I've been sitting on Reddit with a grumbly tummy. (figured I'd give it a shot) If this works out so much gratitude is given. 
0	Hello there RAOP! I am a student in good old blighty, and due to a cock up by student finance, I am yet to receive my loan, leaving me with no money. :(  My rent is due in a few days, and that is the least of my worries, as today I've only eaten a semi melted Toffee Crisp :( I of course will pay it forward, as soon as my loan arrives! Help me Reddit, you're my only hope..
0	Well, i don't have a life threatening disease, i'm not poor, i'm not anti-social and have friends... I mean, there's nothing that makes me stand out to want a pizza more than others. I just want pizza because it's fucking delicious.   I go to school at Ohio University and i just want pizza. Any acts of Pizzaness will be returned to another redditor.
1	Lost my job (was a manager at a hookah bar) due to the owner selling the shop. He overextended opening too many businesses and had to sell off a lot of places, including the shop I ran for him. I've spent the entire day updating my resume and applying for jobs. Any help would be awesome :)
0	Ate my last packet of ramen for dinner yesterday and am very hungry. Would love a pizze, Dominos is in the area, everything else is closed by now.  Edit for location: Marin, CA
0	My scary troll neighbors vandalized my car and I had to have it towed today. My poor stomach is growling and I have no way to get delicious noms! Please help me out!!!
0	I am really encouraged by this subreddit but am still a bit disbelieving that random strangers are so willing to help one another.  I am a major pessimist and, while I try not to be, I almost always tend to think the worst eventuality will happen at any given moment.  So, here we are.  I am supposed to start online classes for my master's degree on Monday and I actually have to ship my computer off for repairs because it is seriously messed up and the warranty ends in 10 days.  :( Sigh, it's not so much the inconvenience of going to the library, etc.  It is just that I feel like anytime I take a step forward, I get kicked two steps back.    A hot pizza on a Saturday night would pick up my spirits a bit and my husband would also definitely enjoy it.  He works as a cook and is always exhausted once he comes homes.  The last thing he wants to do is cook dinner and I am a BIT of a kitchen nightmare.   Thanks guys!  Edit:  near Milwaukee, WI!  I tried to post yesterday but it never showed up in the thread. :( 
0	Been applying to jobs for the last two weeks with no luck yet. I would love a pizza to boost my spirits.
0	Worked in a cabinet shop, no work, laid off, need something other that beans , hot dogs and bologna!!!!!!!
0	We're two students that have packed up all of our belongings to go home, all of our money was used cleaning our dorm rooms (our electric meter has run dry  and there's nothing for us to eat until we leave tomorrow evening.  Please help us my stomach is making sounds like an erupting volcano :(.   We're currently based in Kent, which is in southeast England for reference, and will PM email address or whatever necessary if anyone would be so kind as to help us out. &lt;3  We'll be more than happy to return the favour when we're in more a advantageous situation.  Thanks guys.
0	Hey guys so my Jetta's engine light came on today and I can't get my car into the shop until tomorrow. My roomie and I meant to go grocery shopping today, but now that I'm carless we don't have a way to get there :( If anyone has a a coupon to a dominoes or any other pizza place we would really appreciate it if someone sent a pizza our way! I would normally just buy the pizza, but I'm going to need all the money I can get to fix this bitch. I feel bad if someone has to buy a pizza, so if someone has a free pizza coupon please send a PM my way and we will forever be in debt to you :)  TL;DR: Two college students in Arizona are starving and without a car. Looking for a free pizza coupon if they exist!  P.S. I can post a picture of my cars engine light at request.
0	Hi, I lost my job last month. Currently out of food, cash and would love a pizza to grind on if anyone is up to helping a dude out. Thanks!
1	It's been a rough few weeks due to an unexpected bill, and I've been completely out of food for two days now. I get paid tomorrow (actually 12:45 am tonight, woot!) but oh my god I'm starving today. Can anyone please help me out? I'm at the end of my rope and desperate. 
0	Down on my luck lately and no gas or money to do anything of importance (or fun) on the 4th. Something simple as a pizza would really make my day. I've been a long time lurker and I don't really participate in commenting or posting but definitely could use some good luck.
0	Please and thank you!
1	Here's a pic of Buster: http://i.imgur.com/jgnOY.jpg
1	I just spent $75 dollars paying to get my application seen at the school I'm applying to. I also just payed out the wazoo for a deposit for a rental house and I don't have any more money coming to me for the rest of the month. I barely have enough to make it to the end of the month, a pizza would really help. 
0	bored, kinda crappy week, would really appreciate a pizza. don't have a domino's here, so either papa johns and pizza hut. thank you in advance &lt;3
0	Get paid tomorrow and no pizza in the house. You can see my problem here :(
1	I'm fearful of being labeled a scammer or something after reading a lot of the other posts here, but I assure you this is genuine. My wife of 3 years left me and took our 11 month old daughter a few days ago. She didn't take too kindly to me finding out she was cheating on me. As bad as that is, she took our EBT card right before we were to go grocery shopping, leaving me heartbroken, alone, and without food with a week to go before my next paycheck. My stomach growling is honestly the least of my problems at this point, but I was told this would be a good place to try to get some dinner and solve at least one of my issues, or at least an open ear. I'm going to spend quite a bit of time on here today, as the sense of community throughout the entire site is quite impressive and will hopefully serve as a distraction to what I have going on. Thanks for reading, and I hope whatever deity you follow blesses you in every way possible.  Edit - Thanks to miafria! What a great community and people. 
0	The title pretty much says it all.  I'm dirt poor at this point, trying to find any sort of job, be it part time or just a day laborer, I'll do anything just to have a couple bucks to rub together.  I'm starving, depressed, and love the Reddit community, so if anyone has it in their heart today to help out a beaten down man, I'd be ever grateful.  Thanks
0	If I had a pizza I would eat it  d(O_O)b
1	Normally I would have been fine but some expenses popped up unexpectedly that I had to pay and now I'm going to get late fees on my internet bill because I couldn't fully pay it off. The only food I currently have are condiments, which aren't appetizing my themselves &gt;.&lt;  I will be able to pay it back on Sunday though! I would really appreciate if you could help, thank you!  **EDIT: Thank you ReillyBoy for the wonderful two pizza's!**  I'll be msging you again on Sunday for repayment :)  **EDIT2: How embarrassing, I was able to pay it back the next day &gt;.&lt;**
1	I'm looking to trade 15$ from my paypal account for a pizza hut giftcard. I'm flat broke and extremely hungry and I got some money in my paypal but unfortunately it would take a couple days to transfer to my bank account. I will send first but please be reputable/flair because I would hate to get scammed.
0	Looking for a generous Redditor to get us a pizza tonight. Wish I could give something back but can only offer pics of our [kittens](http://imgur.com/a/zff2c) Just realized the gray one looks as if it died seconds before taking the picture. Rest assured it's alive and adorable. Thanks.
0	Me and my boy (5 years of age) wouldn't mind eating something other than noodles today.  [Take a look at our fridge..](http://imgur.com/LGM7N)  Luckily before my unemployment ran out I got the bright idea to stock up on [noodles](http://imgur.com/5N5rA), and [such](http://imgur.com/Fn1ee).(There are 28 square packs left and 36 cups for those who are curious..)  I am in no way implying that we are without food to eat (coz' noodles count as food right?), just wondering if anyone out there wouldn't mind tossing a pie our way.   **Edit**: I am no longer in need of pizza for tonight, fate has smiled upon me and my son, providing us with pizza from another source. Thank you anyway reddit :) (Current Time: 10:43pm)
0	Moved up here hoping to get a better job, didn't work out like that. Have a job, but it's enough to pay the bills, and that's really it. Payed rent, got cat food for the kitty, and TP. Pretty much emptied the bank account. Still looking for a better job, but until then, a hot cheesy pie would really make my day!
0	I was just informed that I have been retroactively fired on May 18, 2011. I have been out of work with an injury and I was just about to go back when I got this lovely news via email. As you can imagine this has thrown me into a panic over how I am going to pay for rent and food. It will all work out, it always does, but things look a bit bleak at the moment. I would love a pizza to eat while I go over my resume! 
0	Reddit please give me A bit of your time, I've smoked my last smoke And spent my last dime  I'm hungry and sick of My bowls of rice, A pizza I think Would be pretty nice  Though my wallet is empty My heart is full, For I met a hottie In my social lull  I'm selling my Playstation To take out this girl, A sacrifice That might make me hurl  Provide me a break A bread cheese duet, One night of pizza I'll be forever in your debt
1	My name is Liz. I'm 22 and stuck in my food barren apartment with nothing but an empty wallet and a frown. I would sincerely appreciate any help in filling my tummy with some cheesy goodness. I wish I had a sad story to tell but to be honest I was at the Philadelphia Folk Festival for the weekend and stupidly spent all my money, forgetting that my cabinets were empty back at home. Now I'm sitting here, tummy grumblin, on the verge of a headache, hoping to God that someone will show me alittle empathy. Thank you for your time and good day.  EDIT: around the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania area.
0	I was stupidly laid off of my last job and have been without work for the past two months. I could definitely go for a pizza. In return I'll send you something precious of your choosing.   **EDIT:** I live in Kansas. Close friends with the Kents. Haven't seen Clark around lately. Would love a pizza instead.
1	I get paid on friday and I have very little food to last until then.  I'm currently on the look out on a better job that would prevent this from happening, but no bites so far.  As soon as I have some available funds, I'll pay it forward.  Thanks!
0	So... I guess I put my little sob story here.  Well, I'm poor, lonely, and hungry, and longing for some pizza to fill the emptiness in my soul.
1	Ok so my name is Alex or Axeltoss, I am a starcraft 2 caster and am currently at MLG Orlando with Steven Bonnell, a popular starcraft 2 personality... (ROOTDestiny, QxGDestiny).   Steven did a charity drive a while back where he raised over $30,000 with a friend but as a result his paypal was frozen so he can't buy anything. Proof of that is here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fe2pI21GCic   I've spent a lot of my own money on both of us this weekend because of this fact, and I've been spending way too much. I was hoping someone out there could send us a pizza or two. Here is proof of us existing:   http://www.twitch.tv/axeltoss/b/297568206   Thanks a lot for reading. Zipcode is 34746
0	I'm kinda sick, or I'd go out and grab something myself. As is I don't really **need** pizza, but it is a deliciously warm meal that would fill my stomach with delight while I try to grasp the concepts of partial derivatives and such.
0	I was just laid off today, due to my original job being phased out of existence. While I have been as accommodating as possible to make my employers see my ability to learn new things and excel at every job put in my path, they decided because I haven't worked there as long as others I got laid off. It was also implied that the last position I was training for couldn't be done by me because I'm a girl. (Apparently being a girl means I can't use a wrench or climb a ladder.) Unfortunately because it wasn't out right said, I can do no legal action. Could really use an upside to this day.  **Edit: Thank you so much to *unmoderated* for the gift of pizza and literature! You made my day infinitely better!**
0	This guy just beat cancer, and it's his reddit birthday. How do we send this mofo some ZA? (Unfortunately I don't have a credit card or I'd send one myself)  http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ju6x5/looks_like_its_my_reddit_cake_day_today_here_is_a/
0	My wallet got stolen two weeks ago and due to complications with my address can't get my new card until friday. Bank was closed all weekend and burned through all my reserve 20p noodles.  Haven't had anything today and need to walk over 4km tomorrow (edit: to the bank in town) because cant afford the bus, would appreciate the energy boost
0	This May I got pneumonia and ended up in the hospital for 4 days because my immune system wouldn't kick in and fight the infection in my lungs.  Fast forward a few months and I am in the college of my dreams, but my immune system has taken a pot shot at me again.  First it was an ear infection in week 2 of Fall Quarter, now it is the flu.  I've missed so much class I may have to go on medical leave.   My story is long and messy - my life really exploded this spring/summer, which is why I am a 30 year old living in the college dorms. *facepalm* I'd be glad to share more of the story if you'd like, but in the meantime it would be great to have some food other than the Easy Mac, stale tortilla chips and soda I've been living on since getting sick.  Maybe something a little better would help me get well?  I can only hope!  Thanks in advance, Reddit :) 
0	I won't be able to get any grocery money until tomorrow and I am down to a lonely can of baked beans. Could anyone help?  Thanks guys, I love this subreddit and all the good it has done.  Edit: Thank you so much ass_man007 for sending me a gift card. :D
0	I've been dating my boyfriend for three years now. We've been through a LOT, mostly due to my health. I asked for him to take time off of work last year to accompany me to my many appointments and he gladly did so. I am cancer free these days, have been in remission for six months and working two jobs of my own to pick up the slack on medical bills in collections... but he's doing nothing. I feel like a total asshole for expecting him to when I specifically asked him to take time off from his job, but I can't afford to keep both of us afloat anymore. He went home to see his family, but I'm unable to fly, so I'll be spending Christmas alone. I don't want him to see this, so I'm on a throwaway. :\ It'd be great to wallow in my holiday weekend and munch on some pizza for Christmas... I will pay this forward.
0	So I am currently home alone, having a miniature break down about the fact that I have no real friends anymore and that I might or might not be a complete waste of space. Pizza in my opinion is the ultimate comfort food. My day, well my whole summer, has been pretty bad. I've pretty much been black listed from my home town and I feel more alone and worthless than I have in a really long time. A pizza would definitely cure me of my constant sobbing that's been happening all day. So if anyone is feeling like cheering up a sad nobody in Colorado, I would be sooooo happy.....
0	My mother and little sisters land lord left a note on their door stating that if they don't pay their current and late rent amount in 2 days that they will be evicted. The landlord is always really lenient with my mother so it's understandable and pretty predictable that this would eventually happen due to how far my mother got behind. I immediately went to the bank, withdrew every dime I had, got a money order and took it to their land lord.   I did this fully aware that I'd be without and with no regrets. My mother and sister having a roof over their head is far more important then me going a couple days without food. I have a well paying job and I'm rarely home which explains why I have no food in my refrigerator. I help people out whenever I get the chance. However, My belly is really screaming "fuck you" at the moment.. So it would be pretty rad if someone could loan me the money for a pizza. I get paid Monday, and I'm a lady of my word so you can best believe this will be paid back or paid forward.   The throwaway account is because I don't ask for help, I just don't. It's embarrassing and a touchy situation so I'd rather hide behind a bitch account. Growing up we were always needing help with something, and I really don't like asking for help.. However if someone is willing to help I WILL give you my account name, I can even give you my mothers number so you can verify this.
0	Hey guys,  I'm a student at Virginia Tech. Currently broke; would appreciate a pizza. Thanks!
1	My family has it rough this time of the year, this mommy always gets sad cuz my parents passed away. Well to top it off Friday I was laid off not knowing if ill get called back and 2 weeks ago my van died. I wanna put a little holiday cheer into my family even though I'm down n out.

0	Long story short: I am a British student who is now living in Canada and have been the past 11 months. I  recently lost my job at a youth hostel in downtown Toronto (also where I live) and for the past 2 weeks I have struggled desperately to get a replacement job but to no avail. With rent coming, phone bill to pay, and other assortments, I'm stressing. Hard.  I've never had to ask people for handouts, and I really don't know how to go about asking, so I'll just say it.  I would like a pizza Reddit. I have absolutely no cash left and I have barely and food left in my fridge; the past 3 days I have survived on water from the tap, peanuts and microwavable popcorn.  It's a joke, really, and I am ashamed. I have been a long-time lurker and never actually thought I'd create an account solely for this purpose.  Apologies, but help is appreciated.  Proof if required.
0	I'm going in for orthoscopic surgery tomorrow; and just found out earlier today that I have to pay a $100 copay when I get to the office tomorrow morning, this $100 was intended for groceries. I'm only 20 years old, and due to my knee disability, my employer has cut my hours to where I can barely make ends meet anymore. One of the deacons at church suggested this website to me when I called hysterical this evening trying to figure out how I would feed my family for the rest of the week. I have paper work proving my need for surgery tomorrow, if requested. Thank you and God bless.
0	Hi! I felt bad making a request but I'm home alone and off of both of my jobs tonight. Didn't want to eat ramen or spaghettios again for dinner. &lt;3
0	I'm a broke college kid and today is my birthday. Most of my friends are out of town as next week is homecoming and all of my family is 6 hours away. Just looking for some random Pizza to make things better. Proof: http://imgur.com/0Swi9 Location: Vermillion, South Dakota
0	So i recently got laid off from my Minimum wage job due to a back injury. I've fallen on some hard times, I have money in my saving account but, i'm saving it for renting a tux for my best friends wedding. Will pay it forward when i find a stable job
1	She has been running around all day panicking about school and work. She went up to campus twice to figure out financial aid stuff that the school mixed up, her hours just got cut back...AGAIN. We are looking to move out together soon, and with all of this going on I don't know how we're going to make that work and she's absolutely freaking out...and she gets grumpy when she's hungry. I just wish I could do something nice like get her a pizza but I don't have the money right now. Can anyone help?  P.S. I get a check on the 15th so I can pay you back or send you a pizza then!!
0	Recovering addict, now in college trying to turn life around, just out of food and was told of the power of reddit.  Thanks in advance
0	Now all I want is Pizza Hut. :)
0	There's only one thing that could complete this night and with your help, we can do it
0	I don't get payed till friday and my meal plan only works on campus. I'm too broke to buy ramen. I will gladly buy pizza for the person who purchases a pizza for me when they are in need. 
0	These three dogs are a handful and are making me hungry! Would love a pizza this New Years Eve as my spouse/in-laws are out of town and I'm feeling kinda lonely. Thanks in advance :)
1	My dachshund, stretch, passed away last night. I had him for around 18 years and he was my best friend. It's put me in a funk all day and I'd love to eat some pizza and be lazy all day. Thanks ahead of time.
0	i don't know what words to put here  (posted in the fork sub by mistake)
0	I keep seeing these videos popping up on YouTube. You know the one's with the really depressing music and the guy sitting in a dark room holding up signs. I figured why not try it out and see if someone is generous enough to reward My starving roommates (Brother and his GF) and I with some Pizza. I would put more info about our situation but I will let the depressing video do the talking for me.  [WATCH THE VIDEO](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu57Uvqdh7I)  Copied from YouTube video My Brother his Girlfriend and I just moved from Portland Oregon up to Redmond Washington for a job that we got offered. She currently isn't working and tomorrow is our payday as of right now we have no money or food. I have been eating my Christmas candy but that isn't helping at all, in fact it's making me feel worse. I would LOVE for a Reddit to give us a Pizza. Of course I will help out another down and out Redditor next week when I do have my paycheck.  Thanks IkeLewis
0	have little $ to get to and from work everyday and probably wont be able to eat much till wed.... an awesome pizza will make an awesome lunch/dinner for the next few days and ill &lt;3 ya for a very long time ^_^
0	I'm writing a term paper for my Cultural Anthropology class.  It's about Hasidic Jews, and how they interact with the secular world in selective ways, as well as how Hasidic girls try to fit in by selectively imitating secular women.  It's long and rough...       I don't have any meal swipes left and am out of money in my bank account until I go back home and work some more.  I would greatly appreciate a pizza...  And if you are interested I could send you a copy of my essay.  for late night reading i guess.
1	Hey Raop,  I recently got a job as a Standardized Patient, yay. But its been about a month since my last job as a camp counselor and funds are low and the tummy is growling.  I won't lie, I'm not out of food, I could go and eat some beans and rice again for the 5th night in a row but I kinda want to mix it up.   Someone wanna help me out?  -dbrownbear
0	This may be the roughest spot I've ever been in. I have no money and will not have any left over after paying bills with my next paycheck. I don't like asking for help but I'm desperate. I would be so grateful to anyone who could help out, even in a very small way.  
1	So I work at a small, single-owned restaurant, and with the recent heat my hours have been drastically cut. This is my 3rd day off in a row, and my last 2 shifts I was kicked out early because business was slow. Shorter shifts mean less tips. I live on those tips between paydays. My tips have run out, and I made my last ramen noodle last night. I'm searching for a new job because I can't live like this. If this doesn't work, my neighbor will give me some cans and bottles to return so I can buy more ramen noodles. But what would you rather eat, ramen or pizza? 
1	My wife and I are avid pizza fans, but this month has been exceptionally tight fiscally. Having recently put together a new monthly budget (with more reasonable expenses) we've acted more responsibly, but had considerably less fun.   If anyone would be so kind as to reward our new financial responsibility with dietary irresponsibility, that would be grand. I'm sure the kids would love something more than just bland-yet-wholesome Spaghetti for the third night in a row.   Thanks for taking the time to read, and have a great day no matter what.
1	My obsession with pizza actually scares people. This would be the greatest thing that's ever happened to me.  
0	ok so heres the deal cut and dry put ten bucks in the gas tank got two left , broke til friday and the only thing in my fridge is a old piece of meatloaf in a tupperware container that i dare not open, i can provide a picture or whatever else anyone needs as proof but a pizza would make my day a gadzillion times better
0	Short on cash untill I get paid Friday. Kids would love to have a meal they would acutally be excited by. Pantry is not bare, just very little, and not the most tasty things left. Can provide what ever proof asked. The help is appreciated. Sometimes bills leave me with out alot of cash left. 
0	A redditor friend of mine told me about this sub-reddit. I don't have anything to eat tonight, no gas, and $2 to my name. I would really appreciate it if someone could help me out. I promise to repay either in another pizza donation, or in cash as soon as I get some. Thanks.
0	I stopped in at purple east to visit the staff, theyre dog tired celebrating their 38th anniversary weekend as a head shop! There is 3 of us and were broke! Please help us eat reddit! Doors close at 7 which I realize is short notice but we shall be here until 7:20. Please help us eat!
1	He's never heard of Reddit and I just introduced him to it tonight.. I told him not to blame me for the amount of procrastinating he will do this week.  
1	I'll spare you my sob story. Pizza would be indescribably awesome! This is my first time asking and I'll definitely pay it forward.  edit: F5, don't fail me now! If you can beat the crap out of the Reddit alien, surely you can help  make some pizza magic!  edit2: I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more just to *be* the man whose pizza gets delivered to his door.  edit3: Mediocre, random, boredom and hunger-inspired fact: one of my highest scoring posts ever was a video on how to fold a fitted sheet.  edit4: I used to be a delivery guy. Cheesesteaks. On a very regular basis, customers would take several minutes to answer the door, yelling "HOLD ON!!!" open it, huffing and puffing, sweat rolling down their faces and half naked bodies. They were usually about as attractive as you'd imagine chronic cheesesteak takeout-orderers would be.
1	None of the big 3 deliver here...  sorry.  I'm not going to post some sob story about why I would like some food, just that I'm hungry and tired.  If someone could order from a local place I'll give the number and my address or what not.  It would be appreciated. 
0	I thought I could just tighten a few screws.....ended up spending 142.00 on a new faucet.  I just got called in to work.  I would love to leave a pizza or two with my family, but the faucet and work seem to foiled my plans.
0	As the title says, simply a bit more broke than normal this month. I get paid on the 28th and I have enough pasta + pesto to last (and cereal for breakfast) but I'm just sick of it having basically eaten that for over a week now.  Would really like a pizza or something just to change things up. 
1	I am a nineteen year old Western student who finally got part time at a sushi restaurant. I make about thirty dollars more than rent per month. Some variety from the ramen would be great, I've lost quite a bit of weight since moving out and can't exercise or smoke chronic anymore because of the food costs. I am eternally grateful, will pay it forward of course.  In awe of this subreddit.
1	I have some really good Domino's coupons and no money(well not enough to splurge on pizza anyway!) until next Thursday. If you have it in your heart to donate a gift card to me and my 3 kiddos, it would be a nice holiday weekend treat! Thanks for reading!
0	As the title says, I'm a pretty broke college student (at least until my tax return check comes in) and in the middle of finals week studying. A nice pizza would definitely the all-nighter I'm about to pull. I'm willing to provide any info you need via pm. 
0	This stinks... I'm a college student in Normal IL (Illinois State University), but I normally don't have much money for food. I'm living there for the summer because I have a job, but it's part time so almost all of it goes towards rent. Today was a bad day, especially because my friend bailed on driving me over to Sam's Club, and instead offered for wednesday. (my parents let me make grocery purchases up to 50 dollars every 2 weeks). I haven't gone for a month now. All I'm stuck with is frozen vegetables and milk. I'd love to get some decent food for now until wednesday. Pizzerias around here include papa johns, pizza hut and dominos (it's a college town, it has EVERY franchise available).
0	so i have celiac disease and i have just started eating non-gluten things this month. the bread is awful and awfully expensive, lots of other very dry and pricey things...anyway i havent had pizza in so long!....... i've started watching TMNT....
0	pretty much explained it all up there, gotta spend money to make money i suppose.
0	Hey guys, my parents have left on Wednesday and they only left me £25 to live on for 7 days. I now have exactly £0.00 left. If any generous person could send me a pizza, I'd love you forever.  Sincerely,  A random 16 year old in the UK.
1	I tried this once before with no luck.. figured I'd give it another shot. Thanks for your time!

0	I will soon be going on a long deployment which I'm not aloud to discuss but willing to give some info if you ask. Just wanna eat some of the stuff America has to offer before I leave for a long time to Afganistan.
0	I stayed out way too late on a Monday because a friend got arrested and would rather deal with a few days at home than the shitstorm he'd deal with by telling them. Spending my time right and marathoning the wire anything would help.
0	The only thing we have left is a pack of ramen without the flavor packet. Payday isn't for awhile and we're at a major bump in the economic road anyway. Just need something to tide us over till we can get to the food pantry.
1	My name is SPC Collins. I am stationed at Fort Hood, Texas. Been here all of 2 months, and am already having money issues. (which I'll admit is purely my fault.. Except for Hertz Rental Car, the 1400$ they told me was coming out daily, then just yanked out of the account in one day, royally screwed me..) No I am not in dire need or starving, but I have had a pizza craving from heck the past 2-3 weeks. If it helps my birthday was the 8th, and no I did not get a pizza then. I also deploy in less then 2 months. Will return any help when possible, either directly to the contributer, or to the community.
0	Hello I posted last night but forgot to put the proper tags. yesterday I had to spend a weeks pay getting my car fixed, there is no food in the house, i've had a cheese sandwich and four peanut butter crackers since yesterday.

0	Going through a tough transition moving out of state with my three kids and was wondering if someone would be willing to supply a pizza for us tonight. I know that it would be extremely uplifting for them considering the situation. Thanks in advance. 
0	Hello, I'm new to this subbreddit and I'm not exactly sure how this works. Essentially, I'm a broke college student with classes starting this Tuesday. I would like to get pizza for my family tonight just to be nice, but I can't afford it with the cost of books. 3/5 people in my family have celiac disease and cannot have regular pizza without doing serious damage to their body. 
1	Hi ROAP, We are a family of 5 going through a really bad time. My mother in law has been in and out of the hospital sick. Our car broke down 3 times within the last two months taking most of our money to fix as we depend on it very much. I have 2 children one with a disabilty so we really needed to fix our car. We are trying to make our food stretch but would really enjoy some pizza. Thanks for taking the time to read.
0	I hurt my hip and can't walk or stand long enough to go to the store/cook. Can't afford to order pizza(only delivery option in my area is Dominoes), and my GP can't fit me in until tomorrow. I feel like an old lady, can't handle the three flights up to our flat, so I'm stuck inside. Need something to pick me up!
0	Like I said, just dropped my truck off earlier today at the shop, am spending my last bit of money on that as it's a necessity, but unfortunately, I don't have any food in the apartment as I just got back from house sitting for a week. Can anyone help?
0	Im studying for my last batch of finals before applying to college in the fall (transfer student, community college path). very hungry but being broke and having no calc textbook I'm really pressed for time :(
0	Well, I do tech support here in Fayetteville, NC. I got sick a couple of weeks ago and had to go to the doc. I don't have insurance yet, so that tapped out my savings, to start. It also got slow at work, which meant I had to leave early several days in a row.  I just barely made rent. I had 5 bucks left to go grocery shopping on. I bought a 10lb bag of rice and some flavorings (pizza sauce, soy sauce, salsa that was on sale) and have been eating that for the last week. At this point, I just want something with some flavor. I get paid on the 20th, and would love to buy a pizza or two then for someone.  Just figured I would ask. It may work, it may not. Never know.
0	I went to the doc. today, and didn't get that great of news.  I'm kind of down, and would love to have a pizza to lift my spirits!  I don't get to eat out, and after a long day i'd love to not have to cook. thanks!
0	We have had a really rough week. The stress and expense has wiped us all out emotionally and financially. I would be so happy if we could enjoy the last day of the weekend together. We are to broke to go out or order in. We can't celebrate Saint Paddy's Day, and I want to bring a smile to everyone's face. Can you help us with some pizza?  PS I know I don't have a lot of activity, I usually just read everything and don't post, but I have been a long time lurker on Reddit. 
0	I'm not new to Reddit. I often look through posts on this subreddit wondering if it's okay to post from my main account or not. I decided against it and I hope that doesn't scare anyone away. The kids and I had pb&amp;j (peanut butter and jelly for the uninitiated) for breakfast and we are now debating our options. We are not without food, but would just like something different. A pizza would definitely help us forget about our breakfast. PB&amp;J is great, but eating it day after day gets old. I hope someone will please consider us. Any pizza place would work, the little ones and I can share a pizza. Thank you. 
0	Hello,   I am hoping someone will take a small bit of pity on me and help me get my husband and his twin brother a pizza for their birthday today.  I have no extra money, was not able to buy them a cake or even a cake mix to make them one.  I know I am asking a lot but a pizza would be great, and if I get one I will pay it forward on January 25th when I get paid.  Thank you for reading this.  Nikki
0	My lease on my apartment is up tomorrow afternoon and I have nowhere to live aside from my car for the next two weeks. I have no money because my last pay check went into rent and medical bills after having to get my tooth knocked out a few months back, so I've got nothing until next week. Pizza would be great and itll be the last time i get to use my current address lol. Hopefully someone can help me out. 
1	**UPDATE**  [Pizza Received](http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6159/6233102156_02e71819cf_b.jpg)  At home on Sunday night and every other night after sunday, and spent the weekend limping around around house with a torn MCL. I am also an unemployed college grad who has been eating frugal and healthy for a long time. Would love a nice warm tasty pizza.  Will pay it back when employed.  Sacramento, Ca
0	I have my reddit account for a while, I have participated in RedditGifts and even bought a redditor pizza once  just short on cash and really have a craving for pizza.  I would gladly buy you pizza when i get paid.   EDIT: I GOT SOME PIZZA!!! A Friend of mine who also reddits noticed my post and sent domino's over.  Thank you for all the offers. You are all really awesome!  if anyone needs some pizza next week when i get paid, feel free to PM me.  
0	Just got hip replacement revision surgery, got home from the hospital today.  Boyfriend is at work and I can't stand up long enough yet to make anything half-decent.  I'd pay for it myself, but my last paycheck went towards hospital fees (those leeches really drain you) Unfortunately I can't take these delicious pork chops I'm cooking in Minecraft out of the screen, so I'd appreciate if anyone would help me out with dinner tonight.  A medium will last me like at least 3 days.  I have a picture of the gnarly incision they gave me if you want the proof, since I am new to Reddit.  And I did the verification thing.
1	Hi all -- I've been referred here by my sister in Wisconsin where this was mentioned on her local news. After paying our utility bills and only partial rent this month, my family is down to 8 cents in the bank until the 1st. I go to food pantries in my area when I need to, but they only operate on certain days and will not be available for a few. I can provide any proof and would gladly pay anything back. A little food for me and my kids would help a lot right now.
0	It's my nephews birthday and we're having a family get together! The baby boy truly loves pizza! My uncle doesn't believe the karma wielding abilities of the reddit communities. Would be nice if somebody can prove him wrong. PM for address?
0	hello Random acts of pizza! im a poor college student and just came across this subreddit, im going to valencia community college near UCF in orlando and i was hoping to eat a warm pizza tonight. Theres not much in my pantry, a couple boxes of ramen and thats about it.  I was a video game tester for 3 years for Electronic Arts but got laid off 7-8 months ago and havent been able to find a job since. If you have any questions about being a video game tester id be happy to answer them for you, i know it interests a lot of people  thank you in advance!
0	It's cereal or this. I have zero culinary skills and no money. It would be nice to have some pizza to feed family.
0	Hi everyone, I'm mainly a lurker which explains my sparse comment history but have long been aware of this subreddit and think it's a great idea! Our situation is that we are two full-time students scraping by, we've not been able to find jobs so far this summer and are living on very little. It's been a difficult couple of months and some pizza would be a much appreciated treat and give us a bit of a boost. It goes without saying that we would be very grateful and will return the favour next month when our finances are in a healthier state.  Thanks so much to anyone who responds!
0	It's the last day of the holidays and I head back to Uni, UoB, this Monday. Will be travelling all day tomorrow to get back up North so this will be my last meal before heading up. Any kind souls who feel up for helping me have a hot meal before driving all day would be loved eternally till the resurrection of FSM.  Thanks &lt;3
0	...but I'm a dirty bum with no money, so I can't get one for her.  [Here's a picture of me with my swollen face and antibiotics,](http://i.imgur.com/cfGHG.jpg) as proof that I'm actually unwell. I guess I can't prove that she's been helping me out, but... yeah, she's been a saint. She stayed up til 3am and missed her morning class to take me to the hospital.  I'm in Canada, so I don't know if that complicates things, but... hey, it's worth a shot. Thanks for your time.
1	Alright...so, I'll try to keep it brief, not sure if I'm doing this right...I'm a grad student studying school psychology, I work as a fitness coach training the elderly to stay limber and healthy, I mentor, and I am currently working as a AmeriCorps member with United Way going out and meeting with parents and community members discussing how to get them more involved in their school.  On the weekends, I volunteer at an organic CSA farm and I'm getting getting ready to get married next summer.    Man, long story short reddit, I never eat out, but I just finished giving this brainiac an IQ test that took 3 hours and I would REALLY love to have some pizza...I'm broke (make less than minimum wage when my 2 "jobs" are averaged out) otherwise I'd just buy it myself.    I have beer, but no pizza.  I'm not gonna go hungry but...I've been up since 4:00 a.m. and I really need a pizza.  If I get a pizza I'll plant something for you at the farm :)  Thanks for your consideration!
0	The roommate's out, the boyfriend's having a night with his friends.  I'm a week away from turning 22 with no job and no social life (which is good I guess, because I'd be enticed to eat out more).  My family pays me to clean houses for them, but that $100 I make goes straight into groceries (now eaten twice as fast since the bf decided to save money buying lunch at work by having me cook when he's over; I don't mind, but he hasn't contributed much to the grocery bill) and gas.  I'm feeling pretty down tonight, but I'm not the worst off.  I have food in my apartment, and a car that runs.  But I figured it wouldn't hurt to ask. Anyone wanna float me a slice?  I'll draw just about anything you want.  I can do some half-decent portraits, manga was my old hobby, I can make some MLP characters... :P  All by hand, colored, for you.  Or I can send you pics of my roommate's cat and my cat.  Thanks for reading! &lt;3
0	well im not going to make somthing up for a pizza, pizza sounds good.
1	You know the song, Dean Martin, "When the moon hits your eye like a big pizza pie, that's Amore!"  Well RAOP, I come to you with a humble request.  My girlfriend took me out for Chinese the other night, after I insisted that I eat nothing, because of not being able to pay/pay her back, she ordered her meal, then what she knows I like because, well, she's awesome.  I would like to be able to share a pizza with her this week, to A. Demonstrate how amazing this subreddit is, and B. To respond, in kind, to her generous gift to me.   I am not in dire need. This is a request that is desire-based. I have enough Rice and Ramen to last me for quite some time. So if there are other needs that supersede mine, no worries, I encourage you to use your discretion and give to those who, based on your own criteria, would appreciate it most.   Other than that, I will pledge that for every dollar of pizza I receive via this subreddit, I will, within a month, pay it forward two-fold. So know that your gift of one pizza, will become a gift of two pizzas for others very soon. (As soon as I get a second job, to which I am actually leaving for an interview now.)
0	We have evil evil tests tomorrow and we will not sleeping much tonight as a result. Pizza would be an amazing thing to have during this struggle. Reasonable eccentric requests in return will be considered.
0	On Friday night, there I was sitting in my pajamas, eating ice cream when I get a text from a couple friends asking me to come out for wings and a drink with them. I agree and get ready quickly. We get there, order our drinks and food, chatting and everything. We get our drinks and are waiting for our food. Now, we were sitting in a booth and I had my back to the window and I was sitting on the outside. Soooo...all the sudden a car crashes through the building in reverse, pinning me between the booth and the table. I was the only person injured. Within about 24 hours of that all happening, my already insane mother disowns me and encourages me to kill myself (unrelated to the accident) even after I had just had a near death experience. I am now taking a bit of time off work, which I can't afford to do.    So anyway there's a fun story for you, reddit. I would just love to be pizza'd today. 
0	 As said in title, we have a family of four and one pack of meat in our freezer to last until next week. We have like 3 eggs that I am using for my son's 2nd birthday cake tomorrow. Any help would be appreciated. Message me if willing to help. Thanks!
0	Just like the the post says. Tried to make it til the next paycheck (tomorrow), but ran out of food yesterday. Haven't eaten today at all and I figured I'd try RAOP. Someone on reddit before sent me crispy M&amp;Ms before so I know people are nice enough to do stuff like this. I can provide proof of brokeness and am definitely willing to pay the pizza forward to either the giver or someone else next week. Even as early as tomorrow. I can provide whatever verification necessary
0	so. not gonna lie. I've put myself in a bad spot through a combination of bad planning bad, decision-making, and bad luck. Im out of food and currently unemployed. a pizza would be nice instead of ramen. you know how it is, bland food for so long and your just aching for something with flavor. helps keep me from going nuts. my cash is going straight to my rent payment that im really late on. hopefully temp assitance doesn't drag their feet much longer.   also. selling a bunch of stuff to pay bills. comment if interested. will provide pics and stuff. 
1	I ate the last of my PB&amp;J sandwich fixings yesterday and my mom isn't able to buy me more meal blocks until Wednesday. I'll draw a kick ass picture of you as a superhero if you feed me :)  EDIT: wow, putting my e-mail out there was a major slip.
1	I've been eating coffee grinds for the past few days. I'm out of town working, about 600km away, until Thursday when I get paid. I would have been fine but I loaned a few thousand dollars to my parents and they couldn't pay me back when I had to go back to school for a few weeks. I spent the last of my money on medication and now I have 51 cents in the bank, luckily some bills bounced instead of overdrafting my account.  I don't know, if no one else needs help I would be grateful. 
0	Using a throwaway account because my siblings haven't been told yet and I don't want them finding out on the internet, since they all use reddit. My Dad has been a hero for as long as I can remember - he helped take care of me the best he could after my Mom and her side of the family disowned me for being gay. My aunt called me today with the news and broke down crying. It makes me feel even worse knowing she has to call my other three siblings and repeat the process.  I'm just really numb, broke and hungry right now, and nothing would help me feel a little bit better right at this moment than a pizza, a pair of sweatpants, and a tv marathon.  I'll pay it forward as soon as I can to another hungry redditor. 
0	I found this subreddit from the front-page. Great to see it exists. I am a grad-student at Mizzou getting my M.B.A. and while money is tight I would never ask for food for that reason, I can afford a mouth-watering PB&amp;J. Instead I just wanted to share a pic of the newest member of my family that will hopefully not steal too much of the delicious mana some call Pizza! [My pup "Memphis"](http://i.imgur.com/ao70I.jpg). If his cuteness strikes you enough to send a pizza my way, so be it.... you're just another one of his victims.  And for all of you pizza lovers out there, I challenge you to find a better pizza than Pepperoni, Canadian bacon, artichoke hearts, pepper-jack cheese, red peppers, extra cheese, and extra sauce, on sour dour crust.... What's that? you think you can? tell me...   Glutton**   thanks digiteknique, I knew I misspelled it after I submitted but couldn't edit it!
1	I was cut off by my parents a couple months ago because I've been fighting depression and they didn't like my behavior. Since then I've been struggling to finish school while blowing through my savings because of my nasty eating habit till they ran out at the end of the school year and have been living off the generosity of my gf since I picked up 2 jobs and worked 12 hours today but I haven't worked long enough to be paid. We're both broke and hungry and neither of us have eaten today (it's 9:30 here) and I need food so I can work more tomorrow!!! Once I have paychecks coming in I'll pay it forward. Thank you!!
0	Well, here goes. I'm a 19 year old male student, living with my dad. He left for a hiking trip to Costa Rico. He left me some money to go grocery shopping, which I deposited into my bank account. Unfortunately, I lost my wallet 3 days ago, which had my debit card in it, and can not go grocery shopping. I contacted my bank the day after I lost my wallet, and they said that my new one should arrive in the mail on Monday. I have eaten all of the edible food in my house, and am now kinda stuck. If there are any kind souls out there that can help, I will gladly pay it forward ASAP.
1	Not trying to make up some sob story. Just an honest person trying to stay fed. If you could help out Id love to give back when I can. Verfication will be provided. Can do pictures of our food stores if you want!  Edit 1: Food Storage http://i.imgur.com/YveN5.jpg  Edit 2: Got the Pizza Thanks again!!! http://i.imgur.com/hlFxn.jpg
0	My fridge is busted, my house now smells like death and all the food (mostly delicious thanksgiving leftovers which I so looked forward to eating) is ruined. My landlord said he will replace fridge this week, but in the meantime I'm hungry and broke. Will someone help this girl out with some pizza? Thanks in advance from Cali.  
1	I'm a college student who's staying on campus over the summer to do research. I'm getting paid pretty fairly, but there were problems authorizing my account direct deposit and now I have two unpaid paychecks which will not go through until Friday. Usually I have buddies around to rely on, but since it's the summer pretty much everyone I know is gone. I plan to pay it forward when I get money in the bank.   I should also say that I'm not really in need, as I have enough milk, ramen, frozen fruits, and rice to last me a whole semester, I just really crave some veggies / real meat right now.   If you want some verification please PM me and I'll work with you.
0	My Birthday is on November 4th and I am putting this request in early because I am bored and hopefully some kind soul will see it in the next month or so. I broke my leg last Monday and I am willing to provide all the proof necessary. Free Pizza would really float my gondola.  
0	Been working for a month and my job hasn't paid me so I can't buy food . Would love a pizza to get me through this weekend of house sitting.
1	After a particularly ill-timed lay-off, I've finally found a new job! Not only that, but it looks like the lay-off might have been a blessing in disguise, because this job seems amazing!  Unfortunately, I don't get paid for a while. While I have some left-overs I could eat, I'd love to be able to celebrate with a delicious pizza! (And of course, the first new paycheck will have me celebrating again by paying the pizza-giving forward!)  Thanks, everyone!
0	I feel terrible asking and to be honest if my girlfriend ever knew I was doing this she would kill me but I don't really know where else to turn. I lost my job and everything we have is about to go into rent so that we don't lose our home. If anyone out there can help out please PM me, you have no idea how much one good meal would help out right now.
0	I'm on surprise babysitting over night(thanks bro) and I have some food but nothing she really wants, just seeing if anyone could help out with a pie.  Thanks for your time RAOP
0	So, my husband and I decided to get separated on Saturday. It's amicable, but still incredibly sad. On top of that, I am ill in bed with the worst cold I've had in years and have been basically drifting in and out of sleep for the last 24 hours, with brief breaks for a drink warm water. I don't have any energy to cook.  I can't say I'm desperate for a pie, but having one delivered to my door would be absolutely awesome. Thanks! 
1	I am a very happy wife and mother to four children. We just moved which is killing our finances. We are constantly struggling with making it from day to day. I work full time plus overtime.....but I work for salary so the overtime is moot. My husband is struggling with a decision to go through the disability process at such a young age, or to work on a knee that desperately needs surgery but he doesn't have insurance. Applying for disability is a long process and I don't know if we can wait much longer. Anyway, I'd be happy to make it the next couple of days. We are blessed with a little help from food stamps and we have a very generous local pantry. However we're hungry now and the food stamps are long gone, mainly due to a refrigerator that stopped working and spoiled $100 worth of food. (Really hard to stretch $250 over a month's time for a family of 6). We will get pantry food on Wednesday and they even provide clothes. Just need a little help to get by for a couple of days.  EDIT: I'm speechless. [sumpinlikedat](http://www.reddit.com/user/sumpinlikedat) responded immediately when I was being down voted and not expecting even a comment. Looking at the history this is a very kind and generous person. Thank you so much!! Our little ones are going to be so excited tonight!
1	As a rock climber and guitarist, I've been bummed out since I screwed up my elbow ten days ago. I'm behind on rent, bills, and loans already, forgot about automatic bill pay this Monday, and I am overdrafted until my low-pay check on Friday. [Can't get this melancholy but beautiful song out of my head](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VQ5isLBu_To).  Chicken is nice, and these are definitely First World (Boston) college student troubles. My light at the end of the tunnel is a comp sci Bachelor's (and job?) in December, but, man, pizza sounds like pure love right now.   Edit: The unassuming delivery guy handed me an unexpected cold soda and set of garlic bread, along with a huge pizza laden with sausage, prosciutto, and peppers. I couldn't stop grinning. A thousand thanks to anthonybsd!
1	I'm new to this community, turned on by a friend the other day, and I figured I'd give it a shot and see what happens. I was about to post my request, but I feared it would get mixed in with everyone else's and get lost.  My son and I have fallen on some hard times recently. His father passed away about a month ago from a massive heart attack (they call it a widow-maker heart attack, go figure), and we've just been slammed with a bunch of expenses. Jason, my son, is taking it really hard. He's about to turn 15, and his father was his idol.  I would love to surprise him with a pizza some night, maybe get his mind off the whole situation, but I just can't swing it financially at this point, and was wondering if you were still helping out those within the community.  If not, I completely understand, you've provided a huge service to this community already, but I'll keep my fingers crossed.  Thank you so very much
0	Alright, guys. I just got stood up by the same girl for the second night in a row. I have canceled my plans for the night so I could chill with her. She has decided both nights to not bail on me until it is too late in the night to make other plans. And to make it worse, my Netflix stopped working. I'd do anything (within reason) for someone willing to bro out for this.
1	12 teams, 16 rounds of auctioning - gonna take forever and I can't leave my battle station.  Can anybody send a pizza my way? 
0	AND we're all poor college students, one pizza would be a perfect end to a shitty day
1	I posted a long while back for a pizza and thankfully I got one from a great guy who really helped me out. I wanted to give a pizza back but I still haven't found a job. Any help would be great. sorry for another sob story, i know they get old
0	I've recently graduated university. I think I have a pretty decent resume (working on a successful political campaign, interning at a Congressional office, etc) but I cannot for the life of me find a job. Not having a car in a very difficult city to commute in is definitely a problem, but it doesn't stop me from taking the bus. But I can only go so far. A two hour bus ride makes an 8 hour day become a 12 hour day. And scheduling multiple interviews is difficult when I'm relying on the bus to take me. Nevertheless, I'm still pushing through and hoping that if nothing, Walmart will come through.  So yeah, I have to move out by August 1st. My roommates want me to sign a new lease at a different apartment complex to move in by July 22nd, but I don't know that I can do it. I'm almost absolutely broke and it really sucks. It's a mixture of embarrassing, frustrating, and sad. I don't want to move back home but I don't know what to do. I feel like I graduated and I did a lot right to secure a decent job or prospects, but I guess I didn't. I'm studying for the LSAT and I'll take it in October. I plan on scoring well enough to go to a good law school, but that's so far away.  I dunno, I'm rambling. What's up RAOP?
1	I was laid off a few weeks ago, but ndb as I found a new job. Neither paid a lot, but my savings was depleted over the last few weeks while working my new job. Now I am gainfully employed, but have no cash until I get paid on Friday. I could sure use some pizza love to fill my tummy until payday.  Thanks for any help, fellow redditors.   Edit: I got a pie! Thank you, paulinator! 
0	Just what the title says. Husband and I both decided to quit smoking. I went cold turkey, he got the gum. Its been 5 days so far. Food cravings and munchies have kicked in though. I'd love some hot gooey pizza goodness right now. We have Domino's and Pizza Hut. I can pay it forward soon as I get paid, since I'm not spending $40 a week on smoking now!
0	One of my classmates (Graduate of a high school in 2011) had a terrible motorcycle accident. He was in a coma for the first couple of days, then he came out but the doctors had to put him back into one (Self induced coma) in order to maintain his levels of stability for surgery. He is still in critical condition and I am hosting a benefit concert with my band for his family. They lost their mother when they were young (Elementary school) and Ethan (The boy who was hurt) has a twin brother. I've known them almost all of my life and am putting this concert together almost single handedly.   I'm hoping to give pizza to the folks that are working at the concert and the bands playing. If I get enough, I'll even sell it for just $1 a slice at the concert for extra benefit money for his family!   Here is the link to the concert information for those of you wanting to just send your support.- https://www.facebook.com/events/164208037116711/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular  The pizza place (Shaker's) does not deliver so I will have to pick it up. You can order it for September the 28th from 1pm-6pm. You can possibly even preorder it! But if you do decide to order, order it under the name of "Steeple". That's how I'll pick it up. Thank you so much for those of you who send support and those who order! It means a lot. I've been so busy with this concert.   The pizza place's number is (731)-663-2700.  EDIT: Also, please let me know if you order and for what time. 
0	Hey guys, don't have much to say. College student, aspiring comedian. Don't have a lot of money flowing at the moment but today is Monday Madness in Athens (3.99 medium 1-topping) and I could really use some food for the week. Anyone out there wanna help a brother out, just throwing it out there. Will be checking this throughout the day. Promise I will do the same once I get paid for a show (which is rare but I am hoping someone trusts me). That is all. 
0	 I work in a restaurant and my manager is firing people and cutting hours. I am now only going to be working steadily 2 days a week, and next week I go back to school, so finding a second job right away with any flexibility is gonna be difficult. The bf and I have irons in the fire, but we're stressing out and worried about how we're going to get by. A hot pizza and a reminder that acts of kindness are still occasionally possible in this world would go a long way toward cheering up our little family.  I'm in the Louisville KY area. Thanks reddit!
1	Thought it'd be fun to try this out. Just give me some general prompts of what you want the song to be about lyrically and moodwise....I have a style but can try to please as best as possible.  And no this won't be a crappy cellphone recording. I am in the Chicago area thanks!

1	Got booted out of the military several months ago due to downsizing and been waiting on this new job since then. I got it, just waiting for the spot to open and hopefully it's within the week. All our savings are gone and barely subsisting in this 1k rent apartment, cost of living is ridiculous and I can't move cause i'm getting the job anyday. Borrowing from family to make the bills and ramen and other asian staples are managing to get me and my wife by. Just a little something to cheer her and the baby up would be nice. Not used to asking for stuff just I'm pretty sure she's tired of rice and soup. verification code, also new to this so I don't know the procedure pm me.
0	Hello, we dropped everthing on 10/20/11 and used my unemployment check to drive 18 hours to help her. We left 2 kids and a dog home and brought the youngest with us. We did bring 2 hamburger and lots of boxed Mac and cheese and potatos, we have used up the small amount of money we had, and the next check, well that will be paying for car insurance, and then I hope the 3rd check will put gas in car to go home.  And we could really use  a hot and cheeseie pizza!! It would be AWESOME !!!   We r in Wilmington Deleware. And when I get back home to fl and get back on track I will defenatly pay it forward! 
0	My parents come tomorrow, and I have $2 to eat.  A pizza would be very much appreciated, and I can pay it forward later.  Thank you all, and have a great day!  EDIT:  Should've read the sidebar better.  Forgive me.  I'm in Texas
0	i also started a new job, so after my first paycheck, i can pay it forward, or pizza you back up! thanks for the help guys
0	If one person helps me out, i promise to be on here atleast twice a month to pay it forward and restore faith in people, one pizza at a time =)
0	So yeah. My girlfriend of two years left me a couple of weeks ago and I'm pretty much alone with my 3 cats playing Super Nintendo. I'd love some pizza before I leave tomorrow morning, but I have zero money on me after all the holiday gift buying.  Thanks for reading and have a happy holiday!
0	Really need a pizza been eating ramen. and the occasional kraft dinner.
0	Hi everyone,  I have heard of this place and been here before, this is the first time I am posting. As of yesterday I am officially out of food and money. I've been living on Nutri-grain bars for the past month that I had managed to purchase from the store I work at (If they're expired, an employee can purchase them for 75% discount + the normal 10% employee discount, so I jumped on em) however now I am completely out.   I will get paid this Friday, but that paycheck will almost entirely go to bills minus the amount of money I need to feed myself. I'm not going to exaggerated and claim that my situation is dire (it IS Thursday and I only have to hold out until tomorrow) because there probably is someone out there who needs it more than I do. However, if there is a kind stranger out there who has the means and decides to reward me, I would be so much in their debt.  Happy Valentines Day Reddit, and thank you.
0	Okay here's the deal:  A friend of mine has agreed to be the Foster Mother for a Dog in need... However, the organization has all of the sudden burdened her with the costs of Flea and Parasitic Removal treatments, costing over $200!! Normally a Foster agency will cover these costs but this particular one says those fees aren't included in their reimbursement policies... Instead of turning it down and returning the dog she paid to have the dog cured of it's problems like a truly selfless person!  pic of the dog she's fostering : http://i.imgur.com/ziQLZ.png  Video : http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lGu_-4CBtvA&amp;context=C3355516ADOEgsToPDskJYkuuuuA8wYj3_RjQDg61o  She's currently in a bind and is trying hard to get through the next week just feeding herself until pay day since she's been hit by these unexpected fees. If anyone is in a better situation it would be great if we could surprise this animal lover with a Random Act of Pizza!!!!  Please respond in private messages or give the following AIM name a message : Tick373
0	I'm quitting my job in IT to focus on my last semester of college and a career in music management, which is what I've been going to school for. Since I'll just be doing internships next semester, I really need to save my money. And of course I leave my lunch at home today.   I just discovered this subreddit last week and will definitely pay it forward as soon as I have some spare cash. Thanks and have a good weekend!
1	2011 is just not my year. Can anyone help a girl out that's down in the dumps? Ill have a few spare bucks next friday to pay it forward. It would be amazing if someone can help me out for dinner, cause im disgustingly broke. Please and thank you
0	I've probably eaten one meal in the past 3 days. I am broke and don't get paid until Tuesday, and my house is devoid of any food. A pizza would be much appreciated right now. I will take a picture for verification is you'd like.
0	I don't really want to have to do this and I'm not looking for a handout, but I understand the rules of random acts of pizza. I just got into San Antonio, Texas by way of Greyhound and I left my backpack which contained my wallet on the bus by mistake. As such, I'm here without any money and quite hungry.  I'd glady [Offer] when available.  email me at ellotusghost@yahoo.com
0	While looking for a new apartment downtown I somehow lost my wallet.. I feel pathetic for asking because I'm far from a leech, but I'm hungry and out of luck on food.  I ddnt think I could feel so helpless without a banking card..  There are others out there that need pizza too.. But I will pay it forward if someone will make my night tonight... :/  Edit:  forgot to say I live in the northern KY area.  I will also share my REAL reedit username through pm after transaction goes through.. I'm just way embarrassed.

0	As the title says, there isn't much going on here in Cary this Sunday for me. If you've ever been bored to the point of counting the squares on your ceiling, please consider me. When I say there's nothing going on, I truly mean there is nothing going on. A yummy, cheesy pepperoni pizza would definitely break the monotony that is this very boring Sunday. Thank you.
0	I heard about this website online and I hope that someone out there can help me. My husband and I haven't had alot of money coming in, he's been driving me all over hell and high water and of course gas is expensive. I'm 7 months in, to his credit, he has been pretty good about my cravings, even getting up at 3 AM to make a taco run (of course he ate more of them than I did). Today I have been craving a cheese pizza with a little barbecue sauce on the side like crazy. With my families budget, we just don't have enough to buy a pizza. And I hate to say it, but I'm in full bitch mode. Not just for me, but for his sake can anyone help us out? I know I've been giving him hell all day. I haven't seen him in a while, I think I scared him off the last time. I know he's in there wrapping pennies, but there's no way there's enough. I'm in Springfield, MA.
0	Basically my car isnt running at the moment due to vandalism ive lost my job as a pizza delivery driver from that , girlfriend is out drinking with guys probably going to cheat on me tonight been stuck at home for the last week and there is no food going hungry and a random act of kindness would really boost my morale
0	I'm not that great of an artist , but I will use my trusty Wacom tablet to doodle you anything of your choosing.  I'm quite certain that me and my brother won't have much to eat today.  A pizza would go a long way for this broke college student!  Once I get my college check I will be sure to pizza it forward!  *EDIT  I am located in Gray , TN!
0	I've been working on this cartoon idea for awhile, it obviously needs refining but I decided to make my request in the form of a (not rage) [comic](http://imgur.com/hnqAk). Hope you like it! And, ya know, hope the whole pizza thing too..
1	Hi guys,  I'm pretty much out of money (and food, been eating fish sticks) until the first of January, when paycheck comes out. I can spot some other hungry people when I get paid, I have no way of proving that, but just take my word for it and hassle me if your so kind to give me some pizza :). Assuming a tornado doesn't blow up my house tonight, it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks guys! 
0	It poured rain her this morning. Some asshole drove through a puddle and splashed me with water after cutting me off at a cross walk. My socks were wet all day at work (I knew I should've worn wool). Also, my barber wasn't open today.  It's not that this was the worst day ever. There were some good things that happened today and its stopped raining, but that bad morning really left a mark. I need some pizza.
1	I am sure there are a ton of starving college students out there, but I am practically at my lowest right now. After the rent and bills, I have $10 dollars in my bank account. I work at an organic chemistry stockroom, and the higher ups are constantly finding a way to lower the amount of hours I can write on my time sheet. I work more than 40 hours a week, and I can only put in 20 hours. So all my financial plans from the beginning of the Summer went down the drain... I am hungry, and I would love some comfort food.  So that's my story. It would be nice to hear from anyone right now. Thanks for listening.
0	I am exhausted after work, and hungry, however, I spent the last of my money buying Reddit gold for people the other night. That's my own fault though. Anyways, if you're in a pizza giving mood, I'm in a pizza receiving mood. Also, does anyone know how to make an X-mas present seamless when wrapping it? It keeps buckling..  Edit: Don't need it anymore! Roommate came home with that Little Caesars! 
0	I'm not malnourished or broke or anything, just bored. Throw out your offer and I'll see what I can do.
0	I am not from Prague - staying here for 2 days only. The paper deadline is in 4 hours so probably I will spend some more time working on my results. In the name of high quality research, if somebody could get me pizza (and coffee) please I would really appreciate it. ***spoiler:will reveal the title of the paper to the person offering pizza ;-) Thanks in advance!
0	And I'm more than a little nervous right now because I'm doing a lot of job applications, getting a couple interviews for jobs, and really am in a tight spot money-wise, having been out of regular work for nearly ten months. Want to unwind this evening and a sudden urge for pizza goodness crept into my stomach.  ^^I ^^verified ^^via ^^the ^^sidebar.
0	After a rough couple of exams, we would love to have a pizza to enjoy and relax for a night. Tons of class and school work is getting us down. Any help would be awesome, and we would love to pay it forward when we graduate and get jobs! :)
1	I've never done this before, but figured as it's Christmas there may be a kind soul out there who would like to buy my needy friend and I a pizza for our dinner. Sadly each of us fall into the hopelessly unemployed graduate archetype, and this is our first Christmas away from home. We're currently huddled around my laptop for warmth as we're too afraid of turning the heating on. We would be more than happy to pay it forward when we find jobs. We are located in Berkeley. Thanks for taking the time to read this and we hope you're having a happy Christmas day!
0	No money for a while and ankles deep in three papers, studying, and party prep. The warm embrace of pizza would make my day :)  I live in Port Jervis, NY.
0	i'm broke, i'm hungry. i'm sure you've heard it all before. a pizza would make my night (and hopefully make this headache disappear)! is it too presumptuous to say thank you in advance? :)
1	Orange County, CA. This is *random* acts of pizza not *charitable* acts of pizza, so I suppose it's worth a shot. A pizza tonight would make me insanely happy. I'm drooling over thoughts of gooey cheese... mmmm :)
0	My parents are out of town for the weekend and my 3 brothers and I are having a Doctor Who Marathon! We aren't in desperate need of food but we would love some pizza to eat while we watch The Doctor kick major ass! Thank you! 
0	My friend and I are currently Models for Mygirlfund but they take 3 business days to transfer my money into my bank account so I don't have money for anything else right now. We have 3 dino nuggets left and they taste like sponge anyways! Will repay back once my money goes through :( Please help two starving inspiring models
0	So, we are in Terrassa, España (Spain). Today we were woken up by police and forced to leave our home. We are activist organizers from France, Spain, and the States. The reason we were kicked out was because we were squatting the derilict home. It made no difference, of course, that we were fixing the place up and providing a safe place for travelers, and others with no home, to sleep.   No matter if you agree or disagree with our stance on property rights, pizza would go a really long way to making such a crummy day nicer.   Buenos Dias.
1	Single Mom here. So, my oldest is almost 9. She came down with strep three days after school started back. Yay. =\ Had a semi stressful weekend with trying to keep her and my youngest (almost 11 months) apart so the youngest wouldn't get infected too. However, the baby woke me up at 2am yesterday morning with a faucet for a nose and a slight cough. Called the doctor to see if that warranted a visit, and low and behold it does. She was also positive for strep. She's a really good baby though, and except for being off her bottle (I guess the sucking hurts?) a little bit, and hating to have her nose wiped, she's dealing amazingly well.   So to sum it up, I've got two sick kids and I'm behind on household chores (anyone got a laundry fairy they can spare??) and I'd really just like a night off from cooking dinner. I'm not desperate for food, and I totally understand if there are others who are and you'd rather help them.   We're in Metro Atlanta, and are happy with any of the three major chains, but we also have Hungry Howies and Bucks pizza who both have online ordering. My oldest only eats cheese, and I'll take any meat product on the other side. Allergies to mushrooms, so please none of those. :)   I hope that's enough info.. but if not, feel free to ask me anything. :)  EDIT: OMG. Thank you so much JimWill. You are the awesomest. :) 
0	I'm a student who lives off a mix of my student loans and funds from my summer job. I got laid off 3 weeks ago and since it's summer, I have no school money coming in and am trying to stretch what little money I have left. This means a steady diet of rice, beans and ramen and I'm dieing for some variety. I can send some proof in a PM if requested. 
0	Just finished my thanksgiving leftovers for dinner tonight...but now its about time for that 4th meal. Pizza would be the best thing ever right now! :D
1	My fiancé and I bought this beautiful '66 Ford F-350, knowing that we'd have to fix it up a bit....a bit turned into rebuilding the entire engine. We thought we could do it cheap, as my fiancé's dad used to own a garage where he put in many an hour. I even got out there and greasy to help! I learned a lot, but we've spent around $2,000, plus buying the truck (we were walking everywhere, luckily we live in a small town). So to wrap up this entirely too long post, we're broke and hungry, so if someone is willing to help us out, that'd be fantastic!
1	Hey if someone feels like getting me and my girl a pizza that would be amazing. Going through a bit of a rough patch. Anchorage Ak since I forgot to put it in my title. Sorry I didn't get much sleep yesterday. 
0	Hay reddit, about a year ago my mom got colon cancer and they had to do a big surgery to remove it. ( the took out about two feet of her colon) just this week she went back in only to find out that she had a 4x5x6 tumor on the right side of her brain. My dad's a trucker and until he can get back home (today hopeful) I've been left to fend for my self. I am craving a pizza but I have no money; could someone help me out with that?  
0	I am babysitting a four and a two year old for one of my best friends. Her and her husband are going to hawaii for a long waited much needed honeymoon five years late. her flight was suppose to be tomorrow but that one got canceled and the best option for them was to take a flight a day early. This has but a big burden on me beings tho tomorrow I get my food stamps which is the only reason I said I could watch her children for her, because I feel pathetic not having any food for them. I feel like a horrible aunt.   
0	We'll gladly pay this forward but in the meantime we're hungry and were wondering if RAOP could help us out. :)
0	Chillin in Alaska, really craving a pizza. No story, just wishing I could have a full stomach of pizza. By all means, choose the guy above me, or below me. Doesnt really phase me otherwise. I'll probably forget about this anyways :)
0	Hello,  30 year old from TX panhandle area So anyway, i'm struggling! I live in a rural community with hardly any jobs or places to work, and i work online the best i can on surveys and writing articles etc.  I am a remote PC technician and have lots of experience with IT/tech field, but no clients in this area.   I haven't ate for almost 3 days and haven't smoked cigarettes either, because i can't afford them, and actually feel a little better, I just have periods where I want to HULK SMASH everything in my apartment!  I do however have 7mg patches that i acquired from the VA administration.  Yes i'm a veteran, but do you really think just because you signed a contract with the federal government they are going to take care of you for the rest of your life? No.  People that deserve disability have to fight for years to get more percentage of benefits and it's hard.  I am on hud but there is no income.  I offer my services for pizza or paypal  I can Remote in to your desktop or laptop PC only, SCREW APPLE!! and optimize and speed up your system.  No files will be viewed including photos and documents.  You can sit in front of the computer and end the connection at any time.  Will update and make sure you have proper protection and use the latest greatest software downloaded and installed right in front of your eyes.   I Can NOT remote in without a unique identifier and cannot do it again without authorization from you.  Services like this from major corporations can cost up to $200 dollars just for the same thing i offer and will accept pizza or donations.  ]      Today i mowed a large area with someone i know to try and get money, yet that small amount of money is being saved so i can pay my late fees and rent that is accruing which is $100.  Since i haven't ate in a while i got very dizzy and lightheaded and heat exhaustion,  I am recovering from the heat, but hunger has set in.  If i violated anything i'm sorry, this is my first time on here i was referred by an online friend. Thank You for reading and your time!!!  
1	i got in a car accident yesterday and had to spend the last of my money just trying to get home. i don't get paid until wednesday, and i tried to get a cash advance from work, but my boss denied me. i have absolutely no food left in my house, and when i called both my parents to ask for help, my mom just laughed and said to "figure it out yourself" and my dad had nothing to send me (he lives in oregon.) i feel bad asking for something like this, but...i'm out of options. i haven't eaten since last night and i just don't know what to do anymore...
0	Have a few hours to kill before I walk to work for the night. Its kinda far but mostly I just like pizza. Whatever I dont eat will stay at the house for my friend to eat when he gets home. Its his house and all. Have questions let me know.
0	I have about -$5 in my bank account and a beyond maxed out credit card that I can't even make payments toward. I just moved for a new job and am not getting nearly as many hours as I was told, so with my apartment bills, truck bills, gas to get to and from work, I really only have enough to live off rice, ramen, boxed mashed potatoes, etc. Broke college student is broke and needs a break. So if somebody could find it in them to buy a pizza, any pizza, any size, any toppings, whatever, I will be forever grateful.
1	Just paid to have my bank account fixed, and paid rent! Had to use all of my birthday money for bills and such. I am STARVING! I have no cash left, and no food until Weds. and I mean noooo food! I am willing to order a pizza for someone as soon as I get paid on April 30th! Will provide photograph of bank account to show you how poor I am! 
1	Hi guys!  Me and my girlfriend came to the US yesterday. It is so cool here! :) We start working on Wednesday and are kinda strapped for money until then. We are anxious to try anything that is American, and pizza is definitely something related to USA.  We're not too picky, we'd like to try something classic. It is not us to decide what is classic to you, so let it be your pick :)  We live in Kill Devil Hills, NC. There are some places which deliver, but we don't really know them anyways, so again it would be your pick :)  Thanks!
0	I live in Auckland, New Zealand, so remember that. This can be part of the thing that I do. I have a car, so anything within 5 minutes of [this](http://maps.google.co.nz/maps?q=orakei+basin&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=0x6d0d49b351cf3399:0x2a00ef6165e1e540,Orakei+Basin&amp;gl=nz&amp;ei=rjG3TtrrB9CRiQeFpp3tAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCEQ8gEwAA) (like 5-10 minutes or so) is fair game. I can probably make it down to the waterfront. Other cool areas are the former quarry turned residential area, the Auckland Domain, a marina, and an old train yard.  I have a Camera and a tripod, so I can take a picture of myself doing something crazy.  Edit: The pickups here are quite a bit cheaper, so if we organize it right, I can pick it up instead of a delivery. I am also partial to the Mr. Wedge from Dominoes, but beggars can't be choosers. :)
0	I'm a broke student. Seeing all the pizza commercials on TV is driving me crazy. Can someone help me out? Any pizza will be promptly paid forward.
0	I am here because my 5 year old son has been sick off and on since just before Thanksgiving. He has had everything from strep throat (3x), ear infections (3x), sinus infection, pink eye, and the flu. He has now had vomiting and diarrhea and intermittent fevers since January. He has had several blood tests and labs done and we're hopefully getting the results back tomorrow. He has been tested from everything from food allergies and parasites to some pretty serious diseases. As of yesterday he has been feeling a bit better and is feeling up to eating something other than soup. I told him a while ago that once he was feeling better he could have whatever he wanted. Well, my little man has chosen pizza and unfortunately I just don't have the funds to do this right now. (only have a dollar and some change in the bank) So, I'm hoping someone can be my little boys pizza hero before he's not feeling up to eating.
0	Read: hungry :/
0	I've recently moved to Albany, NY and the rent/deposit drained my account. Been surviving on ramen noodles and potatos while job searching and would love something different for dinner tonight. Cheese, Pepperoni, it doesn't matter which.
1	Hey - The title says it all. After a week of exams, I'm letting myself spend the weekend playing Oblivion, since Skyrim is soon to come out, and I have yet to play Oblivion for myself.  I'm waiting for a client (freelance webdesign is my job) to pay me Sunday, so until then, I really have no food other than chili I made 5 days ago, and has been my only meals every day since.  I'll even do any crazy thing you tell me to do in game, if you're familiar with Oblivion, and consider it done (for better or for worst). I'll murder towns in the name of pizza!  It'd really help - thanks!  [Charlotte, NC]
1	Hello! I was laid off about 3 months ago, and haven't been able to find a job since. For 4-5ish months(maybe alittle less) my fiance had been hit by a truck and was out of work for that long. She has been back to work for about 2 months so we've been just getting by on payments. We had to take a loan out to pay for car issues and since I haven't been able to find a job, our bills are being paid late every month until we can finish paying this loan off. It's been fairly depressing, and I can see it affecting her and our relationship quite a bit. I hurt my back not long ago and have been in PT getting it fixed up.  So my job searching hasn't been the best, they thought I would have to have surgery, now were working on just getting it to be anon pinched nerve so I can actually move more. We don't argue about money/food a lot, but I know it is affecting her and making her stressed.. And it hurts me to see it.  Anyways. In my fridge is milk and yogurt. Rice and frozen veggies is in the freezer(Rice in cabinet).. And we've basically been eating Ramen or rice for the past few weeks as we haven't gone shopping in a long time. It's her 2 days off starting today and if, out of the generosity of reddit users we could get 1 or 2 pizzas(2 would be optimum for left overs for the next dinner, but 1 is fine) I will gladly gift, post pictures, and even send you a thank you letter/upvote you for life.  I have these: HL2,HL2:ep1,Portal,Magicka:vietnam Edit: I also have some Wii games(and GC games as I've been trying to sell it all for money). Mario galaxy 2, mario bros wii, and a ton of GC games. Paper mario, luigis mansion, zelda, the good stuff.   I also have Reddit friends that could confirm what I've said above^ So I don't look like some random dude just wanting free food. Thanks for consideration.
0	I'm a history major, not looking for much just a pizza to cheer me up. My girlfriend broke up with me last night, and I'm not handling it well. Maybe pizza is the best cure for depression, because I am missing my girl. 
0	I'd rather not bore you with the details of my week and I like to have a policy of not dwelling on things :). So hey, if you're feeling generous let me know!  P.S. If anyone just wants to talk or play some games together feel free to send me a PM!
0	Hi! I don't consider myself particularly destitute, but some delivery, be it pizza or whatever else, would certainly be appreciated tonight. Story and circumstance below.  ---  I work at one of my school's IT help desks. It's our fall break, and I'm here alone from 2p-10p central. Normally, I'd get a lunch break, but as I'm the only one here (no supervisor, or anything), and I don't have a key, I can't leave the office.  Delivery is fine, but I'm running low on cash until payday. A tight spot to be in this week, but I'm usually OK. When I get off, there will be campus food I can get, so it's really a matter of making it til 10pm.  ---  Anything else you'd like to know, please let me know. Thanks for even reading =)  ---  I was helped out by a friend =) Thanks all, and happy pizza 
0	I'm working on a project with friends all night and all he has in his fridge is orange juice? What the hell I know right. Bring us pizza and make us happy and full! Kosher please (no meats) any veggies are fine. 
0	I just decided to take 21 credits this semester, which is an insane amount compared to the 12-15 I usually do.  I've been up since 5am doing the first two weeks of homework for as many of my classes as possible, which sadly has only been three.  I'm exhausted, and in the least self-entitled tone I can muster, I feel like I've earned a small pie.    Woo!  Oh yeah, and location: Arizooona!
1	EDIT: Thanks to the kindness of an anonymous redditor, I can wallow in my breakup pain while stuffing my face with pizza. Thank you again, good Samaritan.     In summer classes. Life is pretty shitty at the moment. Waiting on my $100 paycheck that got delayed until next Friday. I guess I should have been smarter about saving my money, but I just got out of a long distance relationship that I pretty much threw all my money into. Almost 5 years, and she just left recently, along with all the time and money I spent on her. I just want to eat and stop living off ramen. I don't really want sympathy about the breakup, I guess all the money and time spent was justified in some way, I just want to get over this with the best comfort food I know... pizza.  
1	Hello RAoP! We are  Canadian University students who are very hungry and very broke! One of us also plays guitar and will cover any song you want as long as its not something too obscure.
0	I've been broke and jobless, and waiting to hear back from a few places. Ive been trying my best to eat what I have around the house. Eating cereal everyday has been getting very tiresome and I was going to invite some friends over and would love to be able to offer them something besides a box of corn flakes. Thank you to anyone out there who is willing to give a pizza to a person in need. 
0	We don't have anything goin on tonight, but we DO have a lot of time to kill and some hungry tummy's!
0	Girlfriends coming over in an hour or so who also has no money but is expecting to eat something. I could really do with any amount of food someone will be willing to give. This is the last week we will have together before we go to either sides of the country for university. Would also be more than happy to post pictures afterwards! Thanks in advance.
0	I read an article about this website and can't believe you guys. I am a neuroscience student and prep cook and have been pretty down on my luck lately. I would love it if someone who isn't financially strained could help me out. I have less than twenty dollars to spend on food until the 15th if I plan on making rent. Considering moving out and camping in the woods for the rest of the summer. Fingers crossed.
0	I've been sick 3 out of 4 weeks this month and I'm hoping its not something serious. I've been out of work quite a bit this month (although I'm going back tomorrow) and haven't been able to get medicine because I have no health insurance! Anyway RAOP, can you help me out? I will pay it forward next paycheck (on the 25th, since my paycheck on the 11th will barely be there). Thanks in advance! Whether I get pizza or not this subreddit is a great thing! :) 
0	I literally haven't eaten a meal since last Friday night.. and the friends and family I have asked, have done so within the last month. I don't have money or food at home and I won't until next Monday. I really hope someone will be kind enough to help me out! Please message me.
0	I shall do most anything in reason. I recently moved down here.. In the bumfuck middle of nowhere.  I live a stone's throw away from the Speedway.  I feel disconnected from the world.  I'm ACTUALLY looking forward to the meteor shower tonight-- as there's absolutely no light pollution around where I live.  Maybe enjoy it with a pizza? :)
0	No real sob story, just a lot of revision to do! First post here, can always return and offer when my next loan comes through!
0	We ate lunch yesterday around noon, then proceeded to get crazy hammered and have zero food (literally. I checked) in the house. We're also out of money on account of paying for gas to drive some girls home this morning. Fact is, we're starving. I remembered hearing about this place awhile back and thinking, "DisplacedLeprechaun, one day you'll be hungry as hell. Try that subreddit and see if it can help."  So here I am. And if it works, come this Friday on my payday I'll be giving a pizza to someone on here. Fair is fair.  Cheers!
0	We are all broke and drunk college students in dire need of nourishment. To prove the situation, I offer a picture of Hamm's Special light if requested. Only people in a situation like ours would drink this. Please, help us. We promise to pay the pizza forward in the future when we get real jobs that pay real money.
0	So straight up I am broke and won't be getting any money any time soon seeing as I have no job and been living in my friends dorm for the past few days and been barely able to get any real food to eat. So I was hoping someone be so kind as to donate a single pizza to a dude in need
0	I live in the UK, and my brother has recently moved to Dubai. I recently made a facebook post saying I was getting pizza, and asking who else wanted some. My brother said he was in, and I intend to fulfil his request. I did try to get him the pizza myself, but I couldn't find any pizza places in Dubai that did online ordering, and I couldn't call them because I don't speak Arabic. Help me, Random Acts of Pizza, you're my only hope!
1	hello fellow redditers. i am seeking assistance in the form of food for tonight. Today was rent, and after paying rent, and sending in a check for utilities, I am once again broke. I don't want to bore you with my details, but I am asking for a pizza to help ride out this recession.
0	Hello,  Before I ask my question I want to make it clear I am in no way accusing anyone of anything and I am in no position to buy anyone pizza in fact I am probably more in need of a pizza haha...  Anyway, I've noticed that most if not all requests from the UK seem to go unanswered, why is this? Is it not possible to buy pizza for someone in the UK from America? Or would people rather look after their own country men before others...  I'd really love to find a way to help my UK bros get some pizza. Any suggestions? Thank you.  Edit: I would love to get involved with any ideas people have.
0	Here is my story. I have a 3 year old kid, and due to some bad budgeting this month. I am out of food for the next few days. My son is or course more important than me, and so I've been scraping together what I have to feed him, but I haven't eaten more than a few chocolate covered nuts at work since sunday.   Thought I would give this a try, hoping for the best. 
1	Cliffs Notes to my current state of affairs: Squatting in a friends old apartment until the 17th (then onto legit homelessness), interviews almost every day but no job, I have no cash left and I am out of food, I feel terrible for posting this here and expect nothing to come of it, but I am seriously hungry and asking another of my friends for help is just an invitation to resentment in the future.  Is there anyone out there kind enough?
1	My bank account is completely empty (http://i.imgur.com/Sl7GO.jpg), and I'm eating my last can of pork and beans right now. Financial aid doesn't come in for another month, and I could really use something delicious for dinner tonight.  I mean, I have other foodstuffs, I'd just rather I didn't have to eat rice pilaf again.
1	The Dominos doesn't deliver here but Pizza Hut does! I'll also throw in some reddit gold since I can pay for that with google checkout!  Any kind hearted souls out there mind hooking me up?
0	Hey all, Im just sitting at home alone... really wanting to treat myself to something yummy to help me get in the working mode for all this stuff I have to do before work tomorrow but I'm utterly broke until payday this week :/ I'd love some help. Thanks so much! 
0	Hey reddit,  I'm a recent college grad from Virgina Tech, Go Hokies, with a degree in Accounting.  I'm currently sitting on almost $35000 in debt, and I don't know what to do.  I just checked my account and discovered I have $200 to my name. My rent is $950, all my bills are due and despite having sent out nearly 300 resumes in the past two months, I don't have a line on anything.  I'm not one to beg or look for handouts, but I'm sitting here, constantly refreshing my inbox and Monster.com, hoping and praying for some kind of job offer, and have decided to swallow my pride for at least the afternoon and see if this community's good heart and generosity would give me a helping hand.  I wish I could have come here on different terms, with me giving out free pizzas, but I swear as soon as I'm on my feet, I will return the favor for someone else in need. 
0	Will most assuredly return the favor or pass it along!
0	I have about 15.00 in Amazon payments credit and I don't feel like waiting for it to deposit into my account. I'm also craving some pizza...so, I was thinking I'd have some fun.  Whoever orders me a pizza tonight and sends me their address will get a random gift chosen by me shipped to their house. It won't be a junk item, I will try to get creative and thoughtful with it. I won't tell you what it is so you'll just have to wait and see when it arrives.  My inspiration was a cross between RAOP and RAOA!
0	I would buy one myself if I could.
0	So I'm a massive idiot who didn't bother checking my new debit card worked before moving away from home and to uni. So at present I'm living off my supplies and roommates good will. But classes begin tomorrow and I think my stomach is in danger of imploding from lack of food :O  I would be infinitely grateful if this was answered. I might make a nice little card on Publisher. (If I have publisher? I'll do something)
0	Hello folks, figure I'd give this a shot considering my current circumstances.  Now I know I'm not as bad off as a lot of the folks around here but I figure what little help I could get will be appreciated.  Without going into to much detail of my life I'll keep this short.  Before I head overseas I decided to move my family back to where our family is.  The home buying and moving (on my dime) process has dragged on longer than expected and that has cost us more money than budgeted because of the delay.. I have enough money to put fuel back in the tank and right now we are eating basically what we packed out of our pantry.  We have to last little less than a week and we'll be good.  I have a couple of older boys with me and I'm sure they'd also appreciate some pizza about now...  Thanks in advance and it feels good be get back home to Oregon....
0	Hey Reddit! I'm an RA at one of the colleges in Burlington, VT. I have an event with my dorm tonight, and unfortunately I'm a little low on cash. My plan was to get some residents together, do some team building activities, and then play Apples to Apples to blow off some steam from midterms.  Sadly, I usually need some form of food to help lure these kids in to take part in my reindeer games. Since I'm low on money until payday on Friday, I was hoping one of you lovely people could spot me a pizza. It's a small dorm, and anything would help. I'm not sure how promising to repay a pizza works here, but I'll hit you back with some money to one of "the big three" whenever you need it :]  Help some hungry college kids out, please?
1	Starving writer, here  located in Savannah  just recently moved;  *   Myself and husband  both working but no money  nothing in the fridge.  *  We have much love, still  it's hard to eat out your heart  or something like that.  *  If you pizza me  I will thank you in haiku  customized for you  *  And, when things improve  I will pay it forward, too:  Zen pizza haiku!  
1	Like the title says, waiting on my taxes which will be here this next week. I would be more than happy to give away some GC then. If someone could help my boys and I out with some pizza, it would make the waiting a little better. Thanks!
1	My friend and I will be studying for finals for many hours this weekend. We are poor, but not destitute. Receiving a pizza for studying would lift our spirits and give us a reason to study very hard and do well on our finals. Any pizza gift card would be met with great excitement!  Thank you for your consideration.
1	I went over my current fiances, and I 'think' I can make next months rent. But involved in that process has been cutting down what I eat, and especially how much. I've been basically living on beans, rice, pickles, and potatoes. Now don't get me wrong, I'm glad to have anything. But I'm a little worried about what the lack of variation is going to do to my health. And I'll admit it, even more I just miss tasting a thing that has a flavor.   I've been posting on reddit for over three years now, for what that's worth. I think more important is the fact that one of the reasons I don't have money now is that I wound up donating a lot of it to the homeless when I did...and then I lost my job.   I do work now, but my total income is far below minimum wage. And I'm just scraping by. A pizza would mean more than most people would guess to me. I posted [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/iite6/thanks_what_pizza_can_mean/) about a week back, about what someone's gift of a pizza to me a while back, before this subreddit existed, meant. That's where the meat of my sob story is.   tl;dr: Lack of food makes me rambly and I beg for pizza.   EDIT: The very awesome unmoderated is hooking me up!  Edit2: Pizza is currently sitting next to me! I'm about to eat the hell out of some slices before saving the rest, but I had to add one more time how awesome this is, and unmoderated for doing it. A huge thanks to the entire community here for just being so amazing :)
0	Long story short: i got kicked out of my house for asking to take my computer to a LAN party. (i am NOT exaggerating)  for the past couple weeks i have been staying with my dad &amp; his girlfriend, but yesterday i ran out of the money i had been saving. I don't get paid for another 2 days and i am absolutely famished.
0	I just moved here from Boulder, CO (originally from St. Louis). I finished an internship in Boulder and my girlfriend is here in grad school, so I guess you could say I followed my heart. Anyway, I'm working on moving into my new place and could really use some pizza to help with the move-in.  Thanks!
1	Hi, I've never requested this before and I feel a bit ashamed in having to do so, but it would make the world of a difference. I have a good, stable job and always have. I've always been responsible with money and have nearly no debt, except for one credit card which I'm about halfway done paying. This last week has wrecked me financially. My car is a piece of shit and I spent $766 on brake stuff (pads, rotors - I can show proof of this) and now I'm nearly broke.   I have about $70 in my account (I can also show proof of this) and I need it to fill my gas tank (which costs about $40 here in Vermont). My dad called me this morning to tell me that my grandmother was rushed to the hospital last night and she has pancreatic cancer. There's nothing they can do. They can't operate. My dad is not doing well. I'm here in Vermont and my family is in Montreal. I'd like to go to Montreal tomorrow to see my grandmother and be with everyone during this time.   My fridge has hardly anything in it (I can show you this too!) and basically, a pizza would be a life saver tonight. It's been a rough Monday so far. A pizza would mean that I'd have a meal for dinner tonight, lunch tomorrow, and dinner on the way to Montreal tomorrow. I can also provide a verification code. I only get paid again on Thursday and so I'm looking to see if anyone will help a girl out. Many thanks.  EDIT:  **SteveVStheWorld** has sent me a Pizza Hut gift card. I will post a proper thanks post with photos tonight! I am forever grateful for your generosity.
0	Never got to as a kid. Immigrant parents so we always stayed to basic veg. (my parents were muslims so I wasn't allowed any pork either).   I discovered bacon in all it's glory. Now I love bacon, pepperoni and ham. It always smelled bad to me as a kid but now smells glorious...   Kinda lost track. Anyway yeah, always wanted to try the cheese stuffed pizza. 
1	Sorry for the new account, but I never had a reason to make an account before this.  I have been surfing Reddit for quite a while.  I get paid every other Friday and won't get another paycheck until July 1st.  I don't have any money or food in the house and all the local places that help with food are closed until Monday.   A pizza would really lift my spirits.  If anyone is willing to help me I would sincerely appreciate it.  Thank you!  Edit: hogfathom got me a pizza thank u so much
0	Or I will just be forced to eat food at my work, and we only sell popcorn and pretzels. I hardly ever eat anything other than food from my work because I barely ever have extra money and I feel guilty buying food when I can eat that stuff for free. I make ten cents over minimum wage at my job and had to work 72 hours in the past two weeks so I could pay my rent. I just got paid yesterday and all but $27 of my paycheck has to go towards rent tomorrow. I will only have that $27 for the next two weeks. I feel bad asking for charity but I hope someone out there will take pity on me and buy me something delicious. Thank you!
0	Well right now my room mate and I are  broke, but pretty hungry. We love reddit, and we decided to give this a try. I'll be sure to pay it forward to some hungry redditors next month.  Thanks so much! :D  edit: ontario canada
1	Hi all, I feel terrible doing this as I have never had to ask for pizza before, but am in a bad spot right now, and can't afford any food until my next paycheck. I could make some pizza last a few days if anyone could help.   If you have any questions feel free to let me know. Thanks!  EDIT: A huge thanks to [eetzatrap1300](http://www.reddit.com/user/eetzatrap1300). My request has been fulfilled!!
0	I've been going all down Mexico through Arizona street performing and doing various odd jobs to feed myself and come home. I'm finally here, and would love it if someone could help me with a pizza :) Anything will do, really. I'll do a backflip for you, and I promise to give back to this subreddit! 
0	The title pretty much explains it all. I've been working as a wings delivery driver while in college to pay for rent/bills/food etc. A week and a half since we've had a car/income. I'd really appreciate a random act of pizza, it would make my girlfriend, me, and Henry http://imgur.com/HRB8m our kitten very happy :). Thanks for reading.
0	Hello /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, how's your international coverage?  I'm home alone in Glasgow on a Friday night with nothing to look forward to for the next two weeks except sitting staring at my final year maths notes, hoping something starts to make sense before my exams kick in. I'm tired, stressed and frustrated, and could do with something to put a smile on my face :)
1	This summer has been pretty rough.  The last of my savings went to rent and gas (which my roommate could not afford).  We have been surviving on what remains in the pantry, which is now down to popcorn, a couple packs of ramen, and oatmeal.  A pizza would mean the world :)
0	Low on cash, only have my guitar and my wits. Request any song and I'll try and learn it and record it for you! Don't mind where the pizza comes from but, being a vegan, it can't have cheese or meat on it. Still counts as pizza. I think.
0	Not a dollar to my name thanks to electric deposit, here in my new apartment with an empty fridge until payday. Would really appreciate some food.
0	I have been eating top ramen for the passed week and I just can't tolerate the taste anymore. A nice delicious pizza will definitely hit the spot right now. Thank you in advance! 
0	I've been out of a job for 3 weeks. I've been doing random jobs in the neighborhood to help pay rent. I did land a new job. The only issue is it doesn't start until August (then 2 weeks til my first check). The last pizza I had was one of those Jack's (cardboard things).   Despite having several "flavors" Ramen Noodles are getting old. I don't know what else to say. I'm new to this.  Thanks for reading.
0	No real sad story today, just broke until Friday with little left in the cupboards (Damn cat eats me out of house and home!) Here's to hoping someone with a big enough heart will help a fellow Redditor out. And always willing to pay it forward onto the next guy\gal that needs some pizza!  -Cheers!
0	My son will be 1 on Friday. He does eat pizza and anything else dont worry because he has 10 teeth. Early birthday present anybody? :)
0	Today is my Twins 5th birthday today, I couldn't afford to get them any presents with my situation right now. A friend suggested I check out this site. My Kidslove pizza, we are at the library right now hoping that someone can help get us some pizza. Mama bear will repay back any help that we get, as soon as I can. We are new to Reddit and Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, but have a feeling that we will be giving a lot once mama bear gets backs on her feet. We will offer drawings of pizza, or anything that you like in return for this awesome bday gift.   Love _ Mama Bear and Her 2 Lil Cubs, Brantley and Brianna
0	Studying for the Delaware bar exam which starts on Monday.  Haven't really left my room at all in a week.  Completely broke because I don't have a job until I start work, and all I have left in the fridge are some eggs.  Would love a random act of pizza.
0	I just found this site and I'm happy people actually send pizza. I'm really hungry and I have no food in the fridge. I just got back to my apartment tonight and I didn't eat dinner and I probably won't eat tomorrow either. My parents won't be able to give me money for a while. Can someone please help me with one of those EGIFT cards people give out? I can make some pizza last. I love Domino's. It's around the corner and the closest to me. So, hopefully when i wake up tomorrow I'll have some comments and a pizza by tomorrow night. 
1	Not doing anything this weekend and I would love to be the recipient of a  delicious sausage and pepperoni pie from any of the chain restaurants. I already used my free code from Papa Johns last week. Thanks!
1	Hello! I've been unemployed since February and so far we've been living on her study loans. Unfortunately she can't get that during the summer - and we got denied social welfare so our debts are piling up right now.  It would be so nice to be able to give my girlfriend a little treat!  We live in Sweden - but I've got a Paypal account.  I would also be happy to take ideas of how we could earn some money! We're kind of out of ideas :) (We've tried to "get a job" and we've "sold some stuff")  **EDIT: I got pizza money from a very nice redditor! Will post updates within a few days, when I get the money on my bank account!**
1	Our roommates are all out of town, and a pizza to snack on during our movie night would be great. Thanks guys!  EDIT: We're in Portland, OR.
0	I've been working door to door installing those TV energy saver things, and we get paid per unit as a sub contractor. My boss just decided that he isn't going to pay me. I'm owed about $1500, and there are 2 others in the same boat.  The last of my money I spent on rice and potatoes. It's hard to believe, but I have literally not spent any money in 3 weeks! I'm waiting on my tax return, and that day can't come soon enough. If you have any questions, I have some pretty hilarious stories about going door to door in rural Victoria, the job itself was pretty awesome.   Oh, and cheers to Vodafone who gave me free phone credit so I could get my tax submitted. Very cool of them. If you're kind enough to donate a pizza, I'd be very grateful and would obviously pay it forward. :)
0	This week has been really shitty. My best friend came out a couple days ago and his parents won't talk to him. He spent Valentine's Day with me, which made me depressed. I dont think he wants to go back to his house, which I am fine with for now, but I want to help bring them all back together. Anyways, if someone can help us out with some lunch today, that would be cool,, and it may cheer him up a little.  My email address is fapfappington@gmail.com and I will PM a verification code. 
1	It's been a hell of a day today.  Woke up late to work, lost my wallet during lunch break, and I came home to no food. Thanks.
1	I've got some staples in the house, Ramen, PB &amp; J, and a beanie weenie casserole and I will be going to the food pantry on Monday (I get paid on Thrusday) But I would totally dig a pizza tonight. (Maybe a soda as well?)   There is only so much ramen you can eat before you start to lose your mind. I know everyone post I'll pay it forward when I get paid, but I WILL pay it forward on Thrusday. :)
0	Hi everyone I am in kentucky and I am in need of some pizza and sides for my 2 kids .I am broke and dont get my ssi check on my bank card until late tonight and we need something to eat today can anyone help us out thanks
1	I'm overdrawn 18$ so I'm going to pawn some things tomorrow so I can get out of that hole (expensive fees, ya know?) and I get paid on the first, and I plan to pay it forward, but until then it'd be awesome if someone could help me out on something to eat! Rice and peanut butter is getting very old.  Just look at that [smile](http://imgur.com/D5wIpKC) just thinking of getting a hot cheesy pizza! :)
0	Tonight I ended a nearly year long relationship with my leech of an ex-girlfriend. Tonight is also the first real day off I've had in a long while. I would really like some pizza to celebrate but I find my wallet a little too empty. Is anyone willing to help a guy out and celebrate?
0	~~I'll just be honest - It's Saturday night and me and friends want some pizza. We're broke Italian teenagers with nothing to eat. It would be greatly appreciated if someone hooked us up with some za.~~  It was worth a drunk try.
0	I fell in love with a girl, a seemingly amazing girl, who I was ready to grow old with—for better or worse and everything in between. I'd been hurt before, but I gave her more and more of my trust and grew to love her enough to commit myself to her for life. I had taken her across the country to make sure she could meet all of my family, especially my grandparents while they're still alive. Everything was going great until... well.... She broke up with me rather suddenly. The reasons she gives make it seem like she's hiding something from me. We never had any real problems. The fact is, I hardly feel like getting out of bed in the morning. I still go to work to pay my bills, but I don't really have any friends in my town anymore, and my family lives far away. My roommate is pretty much all I have left around here. Everything around here reminds me of times that I spent with my beloved, but it's all been shattered.  I feel completely devastated. She was my life. I'd love to feel a little bit of the love that you good folks are spreading around if you could share it. I'll get a verification code as necessary. Thank you kindly, fellow Redditors.
0	Like the title says I'm a broke college kid that's working on a paper. I could do with something a little better than beef ramen if possible. I'll be sure to pay it forward when I start my summer job here in a few weeks. 
1	Been eating the same stuff in for a week now, and pizza craving is pretty high.  edit: nevermind, my father surprised me himself.
0	Title pretty much says it all, I realized today that I was in a unhealthy relationship with my girlfriend so I decided that I had had enough. While I know it was the right thing to do it still hurts and I dont really feel like cooking or doing too much. Thanks for taking the time to read this.
0	Hello, I was just on facebook telling my friend how hungry I was and he sent me the link for this site since he knew I loved pizza. I would normally be having a pizza right now but I didn't get paid like I thought I would yesterday, I'll be getting paid tomorrow. I worked 21 hours to help build a chain-link fence for my friend's father's construction crew (he only needed me for a part-time status). I already ate all the food I got (whole wheat spaghetti with a bottle of paul newman's own spaghetti sauce)  This service seems to work and I would be delighted to help pay it forward once I get paid by offering someone else pizza, too.  I am in Cupertino, CA.  Thanks for your time.  PS I used that verification in the 3rd step on the sidebar.
0	I am requesting a RAOP for this family that I have been working with, who are in need of at least 1 different meal this month!  This is a family with a disabled veteran whose case is in an appeal status and isn't due to receive a decision within the next year.  They are a family of 5 surviving as best they can.  They refuse to ask for extra because they don't won't to seem greedy or feel that they are being a burden.  I would really like to do something kind for this family, being as though I am a disabled veteran myself, I can't personally give them anything because I don't have it to give, but my organization has donated food items to them.  I really WISH someone could find it in their hearts to gift this family some pizza!    thanks in advance....
0	I got laid off over a year ago and I finally got hired for something that might stick for a while.  Just started today, I won't get paid until the end of next week and I just ran out of ramen.  Also, I like pizza.  If someone helps me out I will definitely pay it forward after I get paid.  Thank you!
0	I just finished my last day as an intern! I spent 3 months as a glorified slave with no income, and have been rewarded with a job offer at the company (part-time, but at least it's relevant to my degree). New job starts Monday but for now I'm still far beyond broke. I'd love to blow off some steam and celebrate the end of this hellish experience. Anybody who would help me out would instantly reach hero status in my mind.
0	At least I don't think I will be spending my 21st birthday alone... will I??!  thanks :)  EDIT: located in the Bay Area of California :)
1	First off, I will admit I am new, and I made my account after discovering this subreddit.  But I have been a lurker for quite a while and have even gotten my mum addicted to this site (and the aww sub).   Right now I have no gas, and that in itself is nothing new.  But I also have no food, or cash.  I'm not really a fan of spilling my life story.  I don't think it's fair to people, especially if they think I'm only after pity.  But I will explain some, at least that's connected to why I'm in this situation.  Otherwise, what's the point?   My baby sister died when she was barely out of her teens.  I was still a teen myself at the time, and my mum took it very badly.  I ended up becoming her carer and after about five years of constantly hiding anything sharp or pill related and just generally taking care of her, I kind of snapped (or broke. However you want to put it).  It's now eleven years later and the depression pretty much controls my life.   I do get enough money to pay most of my bills.  Though gas and shopping are the lowest priorities.  I have gas/electric here, so thankfully the gas doesn't heat the water for the shower.   I'm not the type of person that can put off paying the bills in order to buy groceries.  Even though sometimes I really should.  That's just the way I was raised.  Sucky, yes, but at least I have the internet and tv to keep me from going insane.    I don't know what kind of proof you could ask for about me.  But please feel free to ask away and I will try my best to verify anything.  Unless you want a picture of me.  That's just wrong.  And evil.  And....wrong :)  Edit: Forgot to include [request] doh
0	pls. got verification code. will dance and tape it for gift cards. delivery is fine too. got dominos nearby, thats pretty much it. its too early right now, but later today id love the pizza. pls.
0	sitting at the house with my wife and daughter, craving a pizza but dont have enough money. any person who willing to donate a pizza i do have a verifaction code to pass along to you
0	My buddy and I just moved into our apartment. Rent and deposit have left us broke until pay day next Friday (9 days, not 2 days). We have no food in the place. Any help would be wonderful and greatly appreciated.
0	    I feel really down that it has come to this but, I have been out of work 3 weeks now and money is really scarce.  During this stressful time I wish to have a night of relaxing and a nice pizza.  The hunt for a new job has and still is quite challenging.  Food is pretty tight as well and I am waiting for my food stamp app to get accepted.  If you feel like helping you would be doing me a nice nice favor. 
0	My friends and I are studying for the finals right now and I thought it would be nice to surprise them with a pizza - to show my gratitude because we have been studying together for three nights in a row but I don't have any cash with me right now. So help me out? We all like cheese by the way.
1	Hey everyone, my name is Nick, I'm 23, had to drop out of college a year ago, and I'm currently living in a van in front of my friend's house. I lost my job and have been looking for a new one for about a month and a half now, so far, to no avail. I'm not asking for a pizza just for me to enjoy, but also for my friend who is helping me out a ton until I get back on my feet. I'm not starving and I have a safe place to sleep, thanks to his generosity. It's been quite a humbling and learning experience, and I'd like to be able to give him something back in return; I feel like pizza would be a great way to do that. I can't think of anything to do or give in exchange (but if you can, let me know), other than a poem written about whatever you want and the promise to pay it forward when things get better for me. Thanks for your time! 
0	Family of 6 would LOVE a pizza gift!
0	Hey Reddit                    Mr.Plainview here forgot my damn passowrd so i had to make a new account im sorry. anyway i was wondering if somebody could help me out. im hungry all i have is a bunch of crap ive been living off of for about 2 weeks now and i feel like its time for a little change. i sadly have bills coming up in 4 days so i cant spend any money right now. but i get paid on the 2nd of september and f anyone can help me out buying this GA boy a pizza i can return the favor when i get paid. thank you reddit                       -your old pal                                  mr plainview
0	yeah so I have almost exactly enough money for rent and electric for this coming month. The problem is I don't have money for anything else. My roommate won't buy groceries because he eats at work and I have been two days without real food. It would be nice to be able to have a pizza to call my own 
0	Sitting here trying to do work and I am starrrrrrving.  I have £1.47 in my bank until tomorrow and no food in the house (except cheerios)  I will pay it forward and repay the pizza back to Reddit sometime in the near future.   Thank you kind Redditors.
1	Hey all, just want to tell someone about my breakthrough. I had a drinking problem for a long time and decided to do something about it. Today I had my first meeting and it really helped talking about it. I'm kind of in a bad place right now financially and quitting the booze is the best thing right now. If anyone could help out with some pizza I would really appreciate helping me take my mind off the booze and money problem. Thanks all.  Thanks to Gary for helping me through this tough time. It really made my day brighter. http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/uizl6/thanks_garyj73167_for_being_an_awesome_guy_and/
0	I have no money (aka poor college student) and I just want to enjoy some delicious pizza, so if can get some I would greatly appreciate it :)
0	Hello! I'm new too reddit ( over a month thankfully) and found this wonderful subreddit! Last month, me and my boyfriend were living out of my car. We ended up living and sleeping there for a month. I had a job, but my hours were minimal and we could not afford rent. It was awful, just recently though we both got jobs and we are able to offers the tiniest little place. Unfortunetly, bill this month left us short on cash with empty cupboards. A cheese pizza, would make the world a little brighter for us!   If you have any questions about our homelessness, feel free to ask!
0	The power went out, and with no money to order a pizza, a 16 year old is going hungry. I am sure I will offer some pizza when I get some more money, but for now, not much I can eat, and hot pizza sounds amazing right now.
1	Yesterday I got laid off with a job I've been working for over a year now. My boyfriend hasn't been working for the past two months since he also got laid off working construction. I have no idea what we are going to do now..rent is due on the 5th at the latest and the next check I get wont be until the 12th. Pretty much feeling shitty about everything right now, trying to figure out what I can do to get money quickly. Plus my ph. is gonna be outta mins, my insurance, and internet bill is due...oh ya &gt;.&lt; ...could really use a random act of pizza. 
0	Hoping to redeem myself after my horrible dinner failure this evening.   Life pro-tip: Ghetto tuna casserole is never a good idea. If you don't have all of the ingredients pick something else.  
0	Thanks to security deposits and two month's rent and hiring movers, I have absolutely no food and no money to last me until I move at the end of the week.   I would be super appreciative if someone would be willing to hook me up with a pizza, which would feed me for at least 2-3 days. I have every intention of returning the favor when I get paid on the 31st.
0	I'm a 20 year old college kid in East Tennessee who works retail but doesn't get nearly enough hours. I'm out of money until Wednesday and seeing how I have never tried this subreddit out, I figured it couldn't hurt to join this community if I will be accepted. I promise to pay it forward later on in the week when I get paid! I hope you guys can make my night since I'm home alone on a Saturday, haha. 
0	I am currently in the process of a move and have exhausted all of my funds in terms of truck, movers, etc.  I need my energy for tomorrow, and the rice I have isn't going to cut it (plus, my pots and pans are packed!).  I should be fine financially in a couple (2-3) weeks once my pay check kicks in, and I will pay it forward, as that's the right thing to do.  Can anyone PM me a gift card for $15-20?  
0	I was just wondering if anyone could help me out, my mother in law and fiance are stuck at home with nothing to eat and it just breaks my heart that not even her boyfriend will do anything about it. Please help thank you
0	Never done this but, I was trying to get home this weekend for the holiday in daytona, but my car broke down and wont be fixed till AFTER the holiday weekend! dont have any money to eat since i put it all into getting my car fixed! $220 So hungry, please help! 
1	My husband got deployed last month and I decided to use all my food money on the best possible gift for him since he is sacrificing so much for me. I have been living on that crap at the back of the cupboards for the last two weeks, and am pretty much out-the only thing left is a box of macaroni and cheese, but no milk or butter to make it with  Yesterday I got a conformation email from UPS saying the package was delivered saturday...it was not. We decided to wait until today to see if the package was just at the local office, but it didn't come today either. The package is gone. I'm in an apartment complex (in California, neer the bay area) and I think the UPS guy left it at the door and someone snagged it.   I'm not used to asking strangers for anything...but I am on the verge of a break down and haven't eaten anything filling in weeks.   We are usually fine when it comes to money, so once our paycheck on the 15th comes I will send a pizza back to whoever sends me one today.   TL;DR (yes, I know I'm a ranter) my husbands deployed, I'm depressed, his awesome christmas gift was stolen, and now I have no money for groceries. If you send me pizza I will return the favor when my paycheck comes. 
0	Finally getting around to having a night to myself (no gf) and video games. Little did I know that we haven't gone food shopping in over a week and neither of us gets paid until this friday.  Would definitely appreciate it and have no problem returning the favor or paying it forward once i can afford it :)

0	Hey RAoP.  I'm waiting for my next paycheck and I'm almost out of money and groceries.  Anyone willing to help me out tonight?
0	Holidays are rough for our family this year, and aren't going to be that good. Kind of has us depressed. Regardless we managed to pick up a couple things for each other and our boys and would love to end our bargain hunting night with a pizza. A little holiday cheer if you will for us and the kids.   This is simply a want, not a need. We have other things to make up in the house for dinner, just would be nice to have a pizza for a treat.. Been lurking here and other reddits once in awhile and enjoy seeing each one of you giving :) 
0	Hey, I have money in my paypal and am quite hungry, and have no way to manage this by my self, atleast any time soon. Im hoping someone is willing to trade a 25$ egift card for 25$ thru paypal. Also I live in Alaska (forgot to put it in title)
0	I can't say that any of us go hungry, or are living in squalid conditions, but god damnit we get sick of rice and beans.   We're located in Xerém, Duque de Caxias, RJ in Brazil. Our NGO works with orphans from poor communities, and also provides education and outreach services in many of those same communities.   I don't even know if ordering a pizza internationally would be even remotely possible where we are, which is why it is a bit of a challenge.  ALSO! WE'RE HIRING!! The pay is shit, but this place is amazing. We have plenty of food to eat, and a roof over our heads. The team is fantastic, but completely overwhelmed with work. If you speak Spanish or Portuguese, and have an interest in this kind of work, we could have you down here in as soon as a month.
0	Just found out my great uncle died. Pizza was always a tradition at his house. Would love to have a pizza in his honor, as I'm broke, alone, and family and friends are out of town this weekend, so I'm alone in the apartment.  In Utah, USA
0	This has been the worst week of my life.  Monday, my grandmother died.  Tuesday, I spend all day getting affairs in order to go out of town for a few days. Important to note that, on this day, I lose my driver's license.   Wednesday morning, I'm having trouble finding my passport, and I end up making my ride to the airport late for work.   Thursday goes off without a hitch!! Luckily!   Friday, there's a lot of last minute things to do for the funeral this morning. My mom asks me to take her car to go pick up the dress Nana will wear for the funeral. I decide to grab some food while I'm out. When the girl is handing me my food, I drop the bag. Awesome. Love Friday.   Today, immediately after the funeral. I get dropped off at the airport (5 hours away) and go to check in, only to realize I've missed my flight by 4 hours. I just checked into a hotel near the airport.      I'm just asking for something small. My credit card is under so much stress right now, and I really can't afford to put more money on it without breaking my ability to make a payment this month.    Also, my nephew used my cell phone this morning, and logged me out. I have no idea what my account's password is until I can look on the computer tomorrow morning. I'd be happy to provide some other verification though.
0	Sitting here at home with the flu and a fever and in desperate need of carbs to fuel myself. Been on the keto diet for a while and have none in my house whatsoever. :/ Payday was yesterday (Tuesday) but since I've been sick, I haven't been able to leave the house to pick up my check! Just got PizzaHut around here and I'm so hungry right now it all looks good to me lol.
0	If someone would like to buy me a pizza I will gladly return the favor friday when I get paid! I just ran out of food and don't want to wait till friday to eat. Thanks for considering!
0	Hello there! I just moved to a new city and unfortunately have not been able to find either a job or a place to live. My last bit of money was spent on gas this morning so I won't have anything to eat until the 10th of November when I finally receive my food stamps. A cheese pizza would be amazing right about now and much gladly appreciated ^_^! It's just myself and my little dog so at times things get discouraging when there's no one else around, this being one of those times.
0	Pittsburgh guy here, got a Papa John's near me.   Usually my parents would spot me some cash, but they've been withholding since they think I'm not trying to get a job. pls halp
0	We didn't have a formal dinner tonight and I'm not really up for making something. I play League of Legends and have plenty of RP so if someone wants, PM me your League of Legends account info and I will PM you back my address. Once I receive my pizza, you'll get the skin or champ of you choice. Sound good?   Edit: Offer stands til' 9:30 my time. I gotta get off my ass and eat sometime if I don't get no offahs.
0	I've recently moved over to London  but I kinda messed up on funds and left myself short. Right now I'm looking at the 23p in my pocket and wondering what I could get with that to buy some food. I have no food in the kitchen and no one over here to help me. Spent the day hunting high and low for a job (which it looks like I might have by tomorrow) and I haven't eaten all day. Please help RAOP. 
0	I am 23, have been in the service industry for 9 years, currently work at a sushi restaurant last night was the busiest night of the year. Worked a 12 hour shift last night drank champagne at midnight and then finished mopping the floors. I was just hitting random and stumbled upon RAOP. I THOUGHT I had 20 bucks in my bank but my netflix went through today. I got paid yesterday but the money wont hit my bank account until Tuesday morning because the owners of my place have crappy checks that the bank atm does not recognize. If someone is gracious enough to reward me I will hold a contest Tuesday to Repay the favor. ORRRRR if you are located in Austin come into the restaurant I work at sit at the sushi bar and will give a solid hookup on some of the best sushi you will have in town. 
0	Girlfriend and her work buddies are pre-drinking at mine, I cant afford to go out, or buy pizza. But being surrounded by this bitchy, whingy and no doubt at some point tearful selection of "Ladies" ( this term is more loose than many of them ). They have invited me to join them out but tbh Socialising with them makes me fear for my IQ.   I get paid on 20th so pizza me today and I pizza you / pay back then ? more of a random loan of pizza !
0	Hanging out, alone in my apartment with my cats, and if I eat ramen noodles one more time I might throw up. Would appreciate something real to eat. My account has been in the red for pretty much the last month. Just got my electricity turned back on since I have a deadbeat roommate... I'll pay it forward as soon as I can.
0	I live on maui and pizza is my favorite food. Can play some acoustic guitar covers or would write an original track, got a couple GOPROs at my disposal could do some action vids or like some Fabio beach photoshoot album. first time poster, open to suggestions :) ~aloha
0	Got a couple of friends coming over and itd be really awesome if we could all share some pizza  Heres a video of my cat being pretty cool.   [Meow](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21mDTy5tDc8)  -----  Video Fixed!   Im in the yuba sutter area in california. I think dominos is really my only option. 
0	My gf is going through a slew of pretty serious shit. Some of it could be considered extreme first world problems (got in trouble with the law for something anyone could get in trouble for), as well as dealing with more severe troubles (ailing family member).   No she isn't homeless, poor, etc., but I thought I'd write this request anyway.  Today is a big day for her, one that determines the consequences of her immediate future. It would be nice if she could come home to a free pizza, and to the knowledge that a random stranger decided to do that for her. She's vegetarian btw.
0	Haven't gotten paid yet and would love a pizzone instead of ramen. I am so tired from 31 kids and its so hot we cant take them outside.
1	i think we all know why we are here, and mabey this is the first step to admitting how depressed i am, but ive run out of food and could use a bite to eat to make it through the week &lt;3. Im in Manchester NH. Not goin anywhere so feel free AMA heh.
0	I'm an illustrator in California. I would also like a pizza. So what do you say?
0	My roomate and I (two average college guys) just finished a crazy week of midterm exams and got rather drunk last night with a bottle of 151 and have the morning shits. Now we are broke/exhausted/hungover/starving and would seriously appreciate a pizza and you would be forever in our debt. 
1	Yeah, just the usual I'm afraid. Broke, payday isn't for a few more days and what little money I do have is going into basic necessities.
0	I get paid on friday but until then am poor. More than happy to pay it forward at that point, but could use some help right now. I'm located 1hr north of Seattle.
0	Hi there. I am in the West Palm Beach, FL area. My family is struggling severely. We have gotten to the point that we need to go to a food bank tomorrow to be able to feed myself, my husband, my disabled sister and my toddler. I would literally be forever grateful if someone would be kind enough to give us a helpful hand to get through tonight. We are out of options.  Thank you so much...
1	Simply put, I'm a broke college kid who hasn't eaten since lunch yesterday...and when I say broke I am not exaggerating. I was paid today and had to use the entire check to pay my bills. I'd kill for a pizza, especially since someone walked by me with a fresh one earlier and the aroma has stained my nose.   Details: I'm not a freeloader--I currently work on campus and am in the process of finding another job. It's surprisingly more difficult than expected, as I don't have a car or the money for a bus pass, so I have to stay in walking distance. I just got home from a 12 hour day on campus so this pizza would be the best way to end the day.   Please be my pizza hero!  
0	My NCEA level three exams kick off next week and I am currently on study leave studying my ass off for them. Unfortunately the only food to eat at the moment is Sandwiches and I am sick as hell of them. I have no money to go and buy my own so I was hoping you guys would help out as a little pick me up. 
0	I would love you forever and ever!
0	Near Charleston, SC. I just got a little behind this month. I'll give a pie out to someone on Monday, or I will give one back to the sender! EDIT: I'm still requesting if anyone is interested. It'll feed me till monday. Thank you. 
0	Hello everyone! I'm usually a bit of a lurker on here but I decided to ask for some help today. My husband is feeling really depressed today, we both got laid of from work a few weeks ago and haven't started getting unemployment yet/found work...things have been very hard. We used what money we did have on bills and rent. We have run out of food in the house (today is the first time this has ever happened) and won't be able to get any until we can go to the food bank on Tuesday. I would love to be able to surprise my husband with some Pizza please. I know a treat like that and a funny movie will help make him feel better for at least a little bit. I will only be able to reply to pms sent before 4pm central time as I'm at the library (one of the bills we had to cut was internet, ugh).
0	I am using a throw away but if ANYONE is serious about helping me, i will provide my real account and any proof of situation. ive recently been attacked by scammers/trolls and all kinds of things, i had a post but i know it will get nowhere and i would truly love a pizza, my post cant get the chance it needs due to idiots, so please, if youre a wonderful person and can help a gal out, pm me and i will provide anything u ask. its almost time for all the pizza joints to close, but i would love a pizza..it would brighten my sea of darkness..gods honest truth.
0	Struggling to find employment. Would love a pepperoni pizza.
0	Is it true that people are just giving pizza away on this subreddit? I'm not quite sure if I'm supposed to tell a story about why I need pizza or what but unfortunately I don't have one and I'm not the kind of person to make one up.  I mean I am in college and as an RA I have been on duty all weekend forced to eat the tasteless cafeteria food if that's not worth a sweet greasy pizza I don't know what is.
1	We are located in Pensacola, FL. Paid off a lot of bills, debt with the last pay check and also didn't want to have to move a bunch of food with us. We underestimated how long our food would last. We have some noodles and jello and non-perishables left but we'd love some pizza!   We'll try to pay it forward once we get settled in our new home. Thanks! 
0	Long story short I've been doing landscaping since March and I got laid off last Friday. I collected my last paycheck yesterday and paid the remainder of my bills for July. Exploring options for new income, but completely broke until then. Appreciate your time for reading this!
0	Our rabbit, Bugs got sick.  He lost 30% of his body weight and as a result his temperature also dropped a whopping 8 degrees F below normal.   We spent somewhere over $100 on his initial vet bill, Critical Care (this oatmeal like grain food to have him gain weight), hot pack, hot water bottle, space heater, and an extra amount of his favorite veggies.  I also work 2 hours away (seasonal position, I basically just get work whenever I tell my boss I'll be in town) and had to cancel my shifts for tomorrow and Sunday.  My boyfriend has missed work to care for him, and I've missed school so I'm also way behind.    He needs 24 hour care so we're taking turns sleeping and watching him, and both of us are never out of the house at the same time.  He's eating more, we're keeping his temperature consistent, but he's not gaining any weight.  His mate died a few months ago, so we think that's why he stopped eating.  This is taking every bit of our energy.    If he doesn't start gaining weight soon, he'll need blood tests, stool sample tests, and a couple others along with an increased dose of Critical Care, an antibiotic, and a probiotic.  The estimate from the vet was just over $400, so we're cutting corners everywhere we can.  Keep in mind, that money doesn't count for the extra veggies from the grocery store (our rabbits always get fresh veggies, but since Bugs is now refusing timothy hay, which is supposed to take up a large majority of his diet) we're having to buy, which is going to add up over the next few weeks, possibly longer if he continues to ignore his hay.     So, if you've made it this far, I'm just asking for a pizza, or pasta, or something from Pizza Hut, Dominoes, or Black Jack (those are the closest places to us).  If you have a random gift card for *any* restaurant in the Tucson area, we'll be grateful for that too/instead.  Anything to keep us from Ramen would be so appreciated.     **TL;DR** Our rabbit is incredibly sick, and we've already spent just approximately $131 on his special care, not including the extra veggies.  This was our grocery budget until the next paycheck comes in, and we've both had to miss work to stay and care for him since he needs literally 24/7 monitoring.  The vet gave us an estimate of $400 for extra tests he could need if his condition doesn't improve.  After we run out of the food in the house, we're going to be on ramen for at least 2 weeks, possibly a month or longer until he gets better.  Pizza wold be wonderful.
0	As the title says. Finished last of my exams not to long ago and finally found work.  I don't get my first pay until Friday and could use a pizza to make the hunger go away :].   Sorry for the throw away account. I can provide you with my actual account (Reditor for nearly two years, second time using this subreddit). My friends / siblings often stalk me on reddit and I don't want them to know im in a shitty financial situation for the time being and offering their help.   Silly logic I know, won't ask family but will ask strangers on the internet for food :P.  My pride... its a very strange form of pride. 
0	This is going to be a long week. Would any kind soul out there be willing to help get me through tonight at least?  Located in Washington DC.   In return, I will answer one question on any topic of reasonable historical interest that you wish to know. =D
0	been going crazy over song structures, and trying to write lyrics [which i haven't really done before] and finally just finished for the day. i can provide you with my facebook for proof, as well as a verification number. i'll be able to pay it forward later this week when i get paid. thanks guys!
0	Not the end of the world if nobody offers but would be a really nice change to a shitty few days! Would love a medium from Dominos or maybe just a couple of their sides to be cheaper  On Monday I'll pass on the favour (not because I'm a nice person or believe in Karma, I'd just feel like a bit of a dick otherwise..)  Thanks in advance if anyone is kinda enough x  edit: Should maybe point out, was hoping for this sometime this afternoon or evening, no rush on it
0	I recently turned 18 and graduated from high school and I'm a YouTuber.  Currently, being apart of the partner program does not bring in that much (a few cents a day) and I'm having my first scripting meeting with some other content creators.  Money is tight and it would be much appreciated if someone could help feed the brains of a couple of teens working on their passion.  P.S.  I'll list you in credits for "Executive Producer".  It's Star Wars related.  In fact, I just finished learning lightsaber FX (finally), I'll link the video testing.  [VIDEO](http://youtu.be/TD6JiAJzXRM)  
1	Pregnant with twins and have 3 other lil ones. Fridge went out and landlord wont be able to replace till tuesday. So anything would be a blessing to me and my family right now. Thanks and god bless all!
1	Will pay it forward and provide pictures of said delicious Pi(zza). Everyone enjoy the holiday
0	so i recently moved to cookeville tn and was going to get an apartment with a friend, but my wallet got stolen somewhere and now im out of over 600$ my ss card, id and my debit card. I have a job lined up with mentioned friend but I'm unable to start working until they have my id/ ss card ect. I would be really grateful if someone could provide a bit of food for me today,  the last time i was able to get anything was around friday(around lunchtime) any assistance would be greatly appreciated.
1	My family wants a pizza. My husband, My 3 yr old daughter and I are really craving a pizza right now. We don't have the money to get it and we are living on low income. I'm not giving anyone here a sob story. There's no point. It's not going to help my situation anymore or less if people know my whole life story. Like I said, I am just going to be COMPLETELY HONEST. We are all CRAVING A PIZZA :) We have a papa johns around here, We love pepperoni and their little cups of garlic sauce!!  :) Want something in return? A Drawing, Poem, Song, ?!
0	I'm close to out of food for this month and could use a pizza. My new job isn't going to pay till the end of the month. I am interested in either paying you back or paying it forward. Any amount is okay and appreciated. :)  Edit: living in Vancouver WA area.
1	My husband has been out of work due to an accident outside of his job. I just payed the rent for the upcoming month and I now have spent the last of my money for the next two weeks. I would love to suprise my husband with a pizza as our food has dwindled down to canned vegetables and bread. I will return the favor as soon as I am able. Thanks for your time.
0	It's summer, I'm a student, and I'm broke for the next week or so. It would be really, really nice to have a hot meal delivered to my doorstep. I'd repay the community once my student loan comes in, but until then I'm getting kind of sick of ramen.  Thanks for reading. :)
0	i'm 35 today! i'm trying to celebrate, but i'm piss broke. 
0	I am currently enlisted in the Marines and waiting to go to boot camp soon.  I have no job and very little money (about $25 in my bank account).  I am just looking for something to eat today and I figured I would try for a pizza.    I plan on paying this forward once I'm making money.
0	I'm a student out at Texas Tech and unfortunately I now have no way to pay for pizza or any other type of food. Please PM me for more details.
0	Luckily both myself and my bike are still in one piece, scuffed though we might be. Planning on studying for my Marine Bio test tomorrow and watching the new Adventure Time ☮  **I get paid Friday, so of course any good karma will be passed on that night&lt;3**
0	It was the first weekend I've not had to work overtime since July. I forgot my debit card at the bar. It's Sunday so the banks are closed, and my fridge was just replaced so I have no food.  Would anyone be willing to help me out tonight with some food? I remember this subreddit from awhile back and would love to donate some pizza Tuesday for a pizza today :)
1	You know how it is - end of the month, all the money's been committed, stuck at work and everyone else is eating awesome lunch stuff and you've got nothing but the earlier resolve to just drink water at lunch until payday...which is seeming less satisfying by the minute.  If granted a joyful pizza, I'll be offering a pizza on the 16th in return, because that's how I (pizza) roll.  ETA: whether today, tomorrow, or Wednesday, doesn't matter. I'll be working through lunch, so time is also flexible (say...by 3pm on any of those days). Thanks for your consideration!
0	I've been laid off for almost two months now and have begun skipping/ stretching meals. I would really appreciate a pizza, thanks so much. Much Love.
1	I'm a college student and I've run out of money, I have very little food for the rest of the semester and I rationing it so it will last (it's mostly oatmeal). I eat just enough to keep me going. I wish i had ramen and Mac n' Cheese, otherwise I wouldn't be asking for pizza.  Thanks for hearing me out reddit.  EDIT: THANKS!! I already got a eGift Card. I will enjoy it.
1	(First time on RAOP so sorry if i messed up the format/rules)  I'm currently down on my luck due to my roommate moving out, and my cat getting really sick (She ended up having hyperthyroidism (Damn rare in cats, i won the sick cat lottery!)) [picture of the sick kitty](http://i.imgur.com/PPAW8.jpg).   She's doing just fine right now thankfully. Though the medication is 58$/m (and thats if they are nice and drop the visit fee like they did last time which in of itself is 43$) until they get the dosage right then back down to 20~$/m (depending on dosage, probably be a bit more, i'm expecting 34$/m if the current dosage works)  I'm just wanting a pizza or two i can eat to raise my spirits (it's the even last finals week for my bachelors! Damn you Murphy's Law) and have something tasty eat while i try and de-stress and work on getting another job while 
1	Tonight's one of those nights where my boyfriend and I are in a mighty funk about our bank account balance. I'm offering some artwork [in exchange for cheesy delight](http://imgur.com/a/u5lWD#0). If there's one-- maybe two-- items you'd like, reply or PM me. I can also make you a similar commission item. I do most things, as you can see there...  [plus My Little Pony...if you happen to be into that kind of thing.](http://fillyphalanx.tumblr.com/)
0	Hello everyone I could use something good for lunch today , I am broke until Tuesday and bArely have enough food to feed us until then. I will return the favor Tuesday . ThAnk you all for reading
0	**Boston, MA**  So. We have this fabulous Constitutional Law professor who had to reschedule a few of our classes for I'm not sure what reason... I think she was at a conference, or something.  Anyhow, this means that today our class is, at minimum, 3 hr and 15 minutes long... but she usually runs over time. Because the class is from 10.45 am until 2 pm (it's 11.45 as I post this), this means that we also will be missing all of the club-meeting opportunities for free lunch.   Pizza would greatly be appreciated as we listen to Scalia arguments!!  *[original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Randomactsofpizza)*  
1	Struggling with classes while on academic probation and being faced with a crazy rent hike where the other option is having to devote time to looking for a new place. I have around $6 to my name right now with no idea when I'll get more... could use a pizza to cheer up a bit. Not sure whether anyone will see this, but thanks in advance :)
1	I am 21 years old and a few months ago my boss unexpectedly cut my hours from 30 hours per week to 5 hours per week. I have been working 1 day per week for the past two months. That's about $200 per month, obviously this has been rough. During my job hunt, I swallowed my pride and got food stamps. This month I have somehow ran out early, and I pretty much only have condiments and cans of beans. I had a very promising job interview yesterday after submitting tons of applications and countless phone calls! I mean, it's retail.. but I am just excited to get myself on a path back to better things. I wanted to celebrate with myself and fill my tummy to prepare for more hunting (job hunting is tiring without a car) and what better to do that with but pizza! :)  I will provide any proof needed. I will also take a photo of the pizza if received.   you would seriously be making my day (actually, a pizza could feed me for a few days)! And hopefully I got this job so I can offer pizza in the future! 
0	Hi raop. If you couldn't tell by the username, I am broke. I have about 50 dollars to my name to last me until August 30th. If you're wondering why this is a throwaway, it's because I have family who know my main username and I don't want them alarmed at my current situation.  I was recently let go from my primary job and have about 12 to 16 hours coming in from part time work when I can get it. On top of that shitty predicament my car sprung a leak in it's cooling system and until an acquaintance can get to my city to help me do repairs i'm reliant on bumming rides off of people to get to/from work.  Suffice it to say a little pizza would go a long way for me while I try to get back on my feet. [Here is the only thing I can think to provide as far as proof](http://i.imgur.com/trd9c.jpg). Not really sure if there is something I am supposed to do otherwise, I just found out this subreddit existed a few days ago.
1	Friends and I had been planning on camping tonight. But I was the only one that actually prepared and I guess really wanted to go because everyone backed out.  Live in Southeastern PA. Would love Pizza.  Edit: I ate large fries last night....
0	Throwaway as my only other account is a gonewild one :p. Anyhow my boyfriend i just moved into a new apartment in seattle, paid all the fees, deposit, first months rent and moving costs and even had some cash left over before our next paychecks to buy food and necessary stuffs. Came to get our keys this morning,  all our stuff in cars and a moving truck to find out the landlord had expected us implicitly to pay a two hundred fifty dollar fee when she agreed that our cute black lab rescue, bowser, could live with us. She in no uncertain terms told is it was the deposit or no dog, we paid up. So now we are very hungry  and we could use a pizza- not bowser of course; he has lots of food. Which will hopefully remain a last resort. 
0	The last few months we've been eating rice noodles in chicken broth at least five times a week for dinner. A pizza would be a very welcome change, and we would very much appreciate it. There's just four of us, so we don't need much.
0	I spent the last money I had on gas today. Im broke until next Thursday :(
0	At work tonight in a hotel and none of us have enough cash to order a pizza or anything for that matter. We would really appreciate some free food to fill out empty hospitality worker tummies.
0	Hello and thank you for reading.  What I am asking for is a pizza from Papa John's.  I don't get paid until tomorrow and I would be able to pay whoever buys me a pie back or just pay it forward.  Thanks again!
0	I have tons of ramen noodles but I really don't feel like eating them and I don't have the money to actually order a Pizza (I have $30 until Thursday and my gas tank's on E) and I would just LOVE a dominos philly cheesesteak pizza like you wouldn't believe.  Edit: I have a pounding headace right now probably because I haven't eaten all day lol
0	New to Reddit, guys on 4Chan sent me this way so hopefully I strike a cord with someone. To sum it all up, here's the general overview of my life since April of this year.   I used to work for a major cell phone carrier answering calls from the general public. I liked my 9 dollars an hour, then they fired me, for taking 3 days off in a row because I couldn't get to work (I couldn't miracle up a car to drive while mine was getting fixed). Seems unlikely right? Well this is Sprint we're talking about, the same people who offer to take $25 off your bill when you call to complain about their wonderful service. They don't bother to tell you it extends your contract by a year and removes your upgrade eligibility, and if you ask odds are they'll lie about it. Speaking from experience, 90% of my coworkers in my department didn't know that. So as you can tell nothings beneath them. If you have any questions about Sprint I'll happily clear them up, there's a way around almost anything lol.  I've tried my best to be self supportive up until now. I cut a few yards every month, sold all my worldly possessions, I even defaulted on my car payments with just 4 to go. You know, the usual stuff. I also tried the unusual, for a week I was selling male enhancement pills from home in my spare time. Then the company went under lol. Just as well, they were nothing but banana peel powder and saccharin anyway. Oh and crab shells or some crap like that, I dunno, I didn't keep the bottle they gave me.  My family's been real supportive through all this, my uncle even changed his phone number without telling me. Ironically I hadn't even asked for anything from them, they saw my post on twitter and deserted me on the spot. I'm the only one in the family who owns his own home, and the only one who hasn't begged the grandparents for anything. After all, I've always managed on my own, so my uncle probably figures I can do it again. Of coarse when his mule faced wife wanted a tummy tuck and a boob job done last year, they asked me to keep her in my prayers. Fair weather family is like that, thank goodness I'm the youngest. I take solace in that I'll be alive and dragging my butt on their graves long after they're dead. Might even take a wizz, gotta water the grass ya know?  Since I got fired I don't get unemployment, and I'm a natural born tax paying citizen living near a major metropolitan city, so there isn't any government programs I qualify for either. Work prospects are bleak at best, especially since now I'm without wheels. I tried doing the day labor gigs they have down at the local employment office, line was already a hundred people long when I got their, 3 hours early x.x Tried finding religion to see if the divine spirit would help with any of my problems, then I found out God gives you hardships to make you stronger. Sure enough my gas stove died later that week, so as these and countless other things continue to stack up I find myself getting stronger and stronger. You can't tell because of this fat exterior but man, underneath all that I'm built like a brick house.  So that's some of it, if I got into all of it we'd be here all day. I just want a couple bucks worth of pizza or maybe a couple of those sandwiches Dominos makes, that'd greatly improve my mood here in the short term. Tomorrow and Thursday I'll be glued to the phone hoping that for the first time since April I'll get offered a job. If nothing else wish me luck on that. Also if anyone's interested in buying whatever curse I've been afflicted with I'm selling it on the cheap =)
0	I'm honesty feel a bit awkward doing this, but would appreciate any help.
0	PM for details. If you can't that's alright. Other people need it more than me. I don't even know if some pizza places still deliver this late either.
0	Just down this last week, cant afford more then the basics and would love a couple pizzas to hold me over for a few days and cheer me up a bit! im located in the usa, and such if yall are willing to help me out.   Thankss!
0	How is everyone? ME? I am okay, just really hoping for some kind people to help me out today. I will be home alone tonight with my 4 kids and my 3 nephews while my sister attends a party.=( Could you imagine cooking and cleaning up after 7 kids?? (YIKES) Could anyone please help me out tonight? I get paid friday and would be able to pay the randomness back.... Thank you
0	Experiencing times of hunger :/
0	My car didn't JUST break down, it's getting repaired at the shop, haven't had it for 3 days. haven't been able to get groceries and me and my fiance cleared everything out quicker than expected. We knew we would be riding it slim this month due to the car repair, so we figured we'd give this a shot! Pics, signs, etc available uppon request ;)! Also, we'll happily return the favor to RAOP within 7 days !  Forgot to add - Orlando, Florida is the area, zip 32839.  &lt;3 Ash + Dom
0	No real sob story. I'm a pregnant high school English teacher and it's the day before payday. We paid all of our bills ahead and are left with 3.73 until tomorrow. If someone felt like feeding hubby and I (and our unborn hobbit), I would gladly offer up a pie tomorrow to someone else!
0	Things have been hard. My wife and I worked for the same company and both got laid off about a month ago. Our unemployment still hasn't been approved and today we had to pawn our TV, game system and guitars so that we could pay bills. After putting gas in the car we don't even have enough left for some food. A pizza or two would help lift our spirits.
1	Left work because I got sick (threw up, fever, exhausted) anyways I am really craving some Pizza Hut and have no money and could repay or pass forward in two weeks. Enjoy this whale http://i.imgur.com/yzpIN.jpg
0	I have been eating ramen for a week, lost my job 3 weeks ago. Company I was at withheld my check, I had to borrow money from my roommates just to buy ramen. Would be more than happy to return the favor next week when my old job actually gives me my check. (Also, general location is Madison, Wisconsin)
0	My job Changed payroll systems so I got a shorted check this week. in two weeks I'll be back on track but now I just want a pizza. can anybody  help me out?
1	Hello!  I'm Riley and I'm requesting pizza for my family.  It'd sure be swell if someone could help us out. We aren't totally starving, but it sure would be a treat. I'm a senior in high school and I work part-time at a grocer. I have 3 little brothers. Conner is 14 and the twins, Ryan and Brando,n are 10. I don't know when my mom was diagnosed with MS, but she worked every day until recently. My dad is a carpenter, but was laid off and has been doing wallpaper for a year now.  I'm going to college next year (don't know where yet) so I can get a good job and take care of my family. They deserve it. I pitch it where I can, but most of my money is going to car insurance right now.   We're managing over here, but it'd be so great if someone could help get us even just a pizza. My parents do a lot for me and helping them with one meal would make a big difference.  Thank you for taking this time to read this.  P.S. No I'm not cutting school; I'm on my friends computer during study.  I'M REALLY SORRY IF I REPLIED TO EVERYONE A BUNCH OF TIMES. MY COMPUTER IS KINDA OLD AND SLOW AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT HAPPENED
0	My mother and I have been rather down on our luck; paying phone, rent and credit card bills has left us with almost no funds at all and the both of us have been wanting a simple cheese pizza but with no way to pay for it. It would be really wonderful if someone could spare a pizza for the both of us. We're in New York City. Thanks so much if you can. :)
0	Hi! I'm a student away for summer school....it's a huge opportunity for me, but it meant I had to come with no money.....been scraping with what little I have....it would be GREAT to have a simple bacon and spinach pizza...anything would be nice though....thanks! :)
0	 Just found out my girlfriend is pregnant, and today her tonsil was swollen up like a bloody golf ball. We haven't eaten anything but peanut butter and jelly tacos since Monday (we've been spending it all on doctor's visits.) I will draw you any image of your choosing, and pay it forward or back as soon as I'm paid!
0	Dota 2's The International 3 is this weekend (popular competitive video game).  I'm not as close to my brother as I would like.  He's 8 years younger than me.  We've had our differences in the past.    I've invited him to come down to NYC for the geek-out tournament watching weekend.  He's old enough now and I'll also buy him drinks and expect to have a jolly good time.  If anyone would like to participate in this brotherly bond in the making, you're more than welcome to!  He arrives tomorrow afternoon.  Thanks!  [edit] brotherly, not botherly. LOL.
0	Hey RAOP, I'm chilling here in my dorm room and could use a great hot pie. I managed to land myself in a "suitcase university"--almost everyone goes home on the weekends. It's pretty lonely here. I have gifted before and would really appreciate some pizza. I absolutely LOVE Casey's pizza, but that's a midwest thing. Otherwise we have Pizza Hut close, and I'm not sure what else.   Thanks a million for reading. 
1	My boyfriend was supposed to get paid Thursday, but at the first of this month we moved and spent all of his last check on moving costs and first months rent. We also bought some groceries, but only bought enough to last until this paycheck. It still hasn't come and we've run out of food. Could we have a pizza? We only need one, and will gladly forward!   Btw, I'm his girlfriend, I don't have a job because I'm in school full-time. I have student aid, but didn't get any for my summer courses, so only have a limited amount. I used most of my funds to pay his student loans so we wouldn't get any fees, or I would be buying cook-able food! Thank you guys soo much! (just saying...because, this is awesome).  EDIT: Thank you deborahb45231 for sending an egift card! 
1	Hey ya, I am coming here to ask for a pizza if any one is feeling kind enough!  I'm pretty hungry and I have no buying power.  I am a very poor college student whos had it pretty rough in the past year and...  Well, I'd enjoy a pizza very much.    Thanks guys and gals, I really appreciate it and I try to pay it forward each day by just being a kind person each day in real life.  :)  
0	Me and my girlfriend of three years just moved into our first apartment together, a little one bedroom in a small college town. We're both students and employed, but the move has proven costly.   We don't have any food in our fridge and my car broke down earlier today while I was moving stuff to our apartment.   Any random act of pizza would not only cure our hunger but would also make my day ten times better.   [Fridge Proof](http://imgur.com/QQ446)  Thanks for reading :)
0	Fiance's birthday was yesterday, and I don't feel like cooking. Have a big test tomorrow. I'm willing to pimp out my super cute kitty for Papa Johns. He has really small ears. My cat, not Papa John.
0	I have the post-festival blues despite being accompanied by my boyfriend and a bunny fairy in a sexy tu-tu. Please fill the gaping void of sadness beneath my boobs with some glorious, glorious pizza so i may convince my boyfriend the bunny fairy is real and that we wasted (/not wasted) one of the wishes on pizza.
0	Out of work for several weeks now, unemployment has been less than helpful getting things sorted and currently waiting to get called back in for an assignment at work.  Pizza got into my head and now I'm sadly craving it something fierce...
0	I know i am a new user and am willing to show any proof needed to show im not a troll or scammer. would really help this little family out since we are down to just a couple of boxes of mac and cheese and my wife dosnt get paid untill the 7th. e-mail is camarocutt@hotmail.com
0	I've been underemployed for a few months now, and just barely making it. Today I got a full time job offer, and I'm really excited! Would love to celebrate this with a pizza!
0	Well I thought I had it all straightened out with student loans, rent, cable, electricity, phone, etc. but my car decided it didn't want to play ball and so I'm a bit short on cash for the next two weeks.  I'd truly appreciate a random act of delicious pizza.  P.S. first time on this subreddit and I'm blown away by the community.  No other site is quite like this.  I have Facebook "friends" who probably wouldn't buy me a slice of pizza and here you guys are, strangers buying each other whole pies. Incredible.  **EDIT:** I was hooked up by a non-RAOP source, but I appreciate what you guys do here.  
0	Hey guys as i have said before i do actually work but just been going through some hard times of late. Tonight i find myself with no food willing to get someone a pizza on payday but looking for a nice person to possibly do me a favour tonight   Cheers
0	We dont tend to have fast food pizza, we make all our own food at home, but we do enjoy a good hot pizza every now and then. We are incredibly unlikely to buy OURSELVES a pizza, as we tend to use our food money at the Farmer's Market, but if someone were to buy us a pizza today, I would definitely return the favor, or pay it forward, whichever the sender prefers. We are located in North Florida and we are not at all picky as to which chain the pizza comes from :)
1	I could really use some help. I took my dog [Volk](http://tinypic.com/r/241rqmf/7), he was 25% Timber Wolf 75% German Sheperd, to the vet yesterday because he stopped eating and was generally acting really weird, not wanting to move. It had been getting worse over the course of last week. After the vet's initial examination, he thought it had something to do with Volks kidneys, so I left him with the vet overnight. I got a call this morning from the Vet's office, telling me that it was some congenital disease, that causes terminal kidney failure and that though I could probably keep him alive on dialysis for a while, it would be extremely expensive and he wouldn't be living a full, happy life. So, I went in this morning and said good-bye.  Anyway, the total cost of the visit, tests, and euthanasia was close to $300, all of which I had to pay up front. That was supposed to be grocery money. I feel bad asking for help from people I don't even know, but all my roommates and friends went home for the summer, and I promise I'll pay it forward.  I'm in Dallas.
1	 I am literally this poor: http://i.imgur.com/uUNES.jpg  I couldn't even afford to pay for my anti-depressant medication so one pizza would go a long way in helping me out and I get paid wednesday and will gladly pay back anyone willing to help me out. I'd really really appreciate it.
0	I am very starving at the moment and i have nothing to eat i am willing to do anything for food, Please help.  I live in Salem, NH
0	Just finished the last of my exams recently and while looking for full time employment could use some pizza :] .   Made a throw away account so friends and family don't realize how broke I am atm but I am willing to provide my real account via pm. Of course I shall repay the favor to the person or just put up a contest later on for a pizza once I begin working again :].   Anything is appreciated. Thank you for your time 
0	Feels really strange to ask.. but, long story short, I went to visit friends this weekend up at SDSU in Brookings, SD, and after checking my bank account, I saw a nice 900 dollar deduction... from a payment made in February. I return back to Lincoln, NE in a couple days, and I can make it gas wise.. but if someone can spare a 5 dollar pizza hut calzone or something, i'd love it. Love. Probably couldn't eat it, because I'd marry it.. but it'd just be an elaborate ploy to get to the rest of it's family. If you can't give, words of encouragement are nice too. I can try to eat those.
0	my children are coming home after being gone 21 days and i would like to take them for pizza when they get here but i can not afford it.  we are a family that  lives paycheck to paycheck and are often short on funds, with school starting next week we are truly in the hole.  I want to be able to sit down with my girls and talk about their trip without having to worry about anything.  Thank you.
0	So my  gf is out of town and I've caught up all the house work so it's time for a well deserved marathon with a neighbor.    I have used all my money towards bills so the spending money is with my gf and I would feel bad asking my neighbor for pizza since he is always broke like myself.  Just wanted to see if anyone would be so kind to hook  us up with  a pizza or 2.  O and don't think  we are skipping  The Hobbit! 
0	I spent some time reading this site before I decided to join and ask and apparently it is not polite to join just to ask for a pizza but I REALLY could use one.  Im pregnant from a man who does not care about me's baby.  I guess I was just his toy till he found a new one.  My son Josh is 3.  Im still young and I know I have my whole life ahead of me but THAT life looks pretty grim right now if you ask me.  OH and to top if off my parents are drug addicts.  Now I am pretty sure a pizza is not going to help me situation but I AM hungry right now so if someone feels like being generous that would be GREAT!
1	Hi, I am a married college student with no job or income, my wife doesn't have one either. Right now we have about 40 bucks to spend for the rest of the month until we get our school financial aid in the last week of August.  As I mentioned before it was my birthday a few days ago and no one bought me pizza :( sad day. On top of that I just went to go get the cheesecake my wife made for me for my birthday and someone ate it before I could. We are living with her parents at the moment because it is close to the school we both attend, but we recently moved here and haven't been able to find jobs yet, the only money we have been living on is the left over financial aid from last spring semester.  We can make it the rest of the month food wise, but not pizza wise. Without Pizza how will we survive?  EDIT: Location is around Sacramento California.   Also our favorite type of Pizza is a deal from Papa Johns we regularly get when we have money that costs around 15-20 bucks. I can't remember the exact price.
1	So I'm sitting here reading through one of my many favorite subreddits, the wife has the tv on and all they keep showing is pizza commercials. Now that has me hungry for pizza. Anybody have an extra pizza out there that they aren't using? I could put it to good use! My pizza factor would go up by a thousand fold!
1	Title pretty much says all. Tired of only eating ramen. I would be very grateful if someone could help :)   Verification is ready!  Edit: I'm from New Mexico
1	Hey Reddit, I heard about this sub-reddit for a little while now, and think its an awesome idea. I'm a 24 year old college student from South-West Sydney, working a part-time warehouse job to help pay bills, and just moved into a shared accommodation. Things weren't always this difficult. I had a girlfriend live with me, so sharing bills and having food wasn't an issue.  But now that I've been single for a year, and trying to make my way through college, things have been rough. I have depleted any savings I once had, and my credit cards are shot. I still have at least another year in college, but seriously need to consider some kind of alternative to make my way through this.  I rarely go out with friends because of my situation. I haven't had a beer in ages, and can't remember the last time I ate 3 square meals in a day. I might only have one meal a day, because I have to consciously ration the food and money I have. I even invested in hair-clippers recently, just so I can save money on haircuts. I have been living paycheck to paycheck for the past few months now, and putting food on my plate is simply getting more difficult.  It's kind of depressing actually. I never have thought surviving alone would be so hard.  I must admit, I had a little too much pride to think about asking this pizza Reddit before, but long story short... I'm starving. I'm very embarrassed to ask anyone, as I don't want people to know how poor I am. However, if someone could help a brother out, I would forever be in-debt. Its not just about the pizza, its about helping someone in a time its needed most. I would most certainly love to be able to "pay-it-back" to others who need help, when I get back on my feet (if I find my feet at all).    **UPDATE:**  **EDIT: ** Received the Pizza, and it was the most tastiest bloody pizza I have tasted in a long time. **1stGenRex** you are so awesome. Reddit should be proud to have members like you and others who have offered a kindness that literally makes me want to tear up.  Here are some pics. Oh before I forget, **1stGenRex** decided to be extra awesome by spoiling me with a box of [Magnum minis](http://i.imgur.com/0BfhY.jpg) and a pepsi. Here is the evidence that **1stGenRex** is one of the coolest mofo's on Reddit:  [Pic1](http://i.imgur.com/v71mw.jpg)  [Pic2](http://i.imgur.com/lvg0x.jpg)  [Pic3 - With my ugly mug enjoying the hell outta that pizza](http://i.imgur.com/si9Fq.jpg)  Reddit and Random_acts_of_Pizza and **1stGenRex** stay awesome. Real life Karma will be returned for your kindness.  *sniff* ...love you guys...  I'll be sure to keep subscribed so that one day, I can return the kindness onto others. I can't believe you Reddit. You guys are too awesome.
1	Tried this once before but I guess it never went through! Hoping to someone feels like sharing a great weekend by helping me start off a nice lunch/dinner meal! 
0	Hey man. This subreddit is awesome! Might as well give it a try. Basically I'm out of money, and the only thing I have to eat for the rest of the months is pasta. Aye, I'll survive, but fuck it's boring.
0	[They](http://imgur.com/y63DB) just opened up down the street from me . Ill send you a pic of the pizza if you send me a pic of your pizza.  Lets order each other a pizza and use a funny reddit inspired names . I figure we can post the name on the receipt to share with everyone else.  [Here](http://imgur.com/tJ3j9) is the new shop . Doesn't look very new but it is.   PS - I have never been asked for an ID so I figure it would work.  PPS - If this works out I plan on buying a few pizzas for the hungry as well .
0	Recently my roommate and I were both let go from the local hotel where we worked front desk.  We have been struggling to get by as unemployment barely pays enough to cover our basic expenses.  Lately we have eaten a lot of ramen/rice/toast/etc.  As of yesterday we are entirely out of food so today we decided we would try to apply for food stamps.  The application process is a lot of paperwork and processing so hopefully we can get some assistance by next week.  I'm not a fan of asking for handouts but when you haven't eaten in a few days I guess you just have to swallow your pride.  If anyone can help us out we would truly appreciate it and will definitely pay it forward when our financial situation turns around.   Location Rhode Island  **TL;DR**  Sooo poor and sooo hungry.    Also [here's a picture of my cats!](http://i.imgur.com/2ZNKYAI.jpg) because of well, ya know, reddit.  As a side note despite their owners situation, these kitties are **never** without food.  I would never let a helpless animal suffer because i'm having trouble making ends meet.
0	I'm amazed that such a thing exists! I don't really know how this works, but if someone could get us a pizza we would be so grateful! We would eat the whole thing with much happy yelling while watching The Iron Giant. 
0	Alright, that first part isn't entirely true. I did spend last night in the ER, but not for anything terrible. But I'm broke and really hungry and would greatly appreciate the help of a fellow redditor.   In the Southwest Washington area.
0	Hey. I recently had my hours cut back at work, and have been struggling to find a second job to make up for the lost wages. I've had to cut down on my food budget in order to pay my bills, and have been eating nothing but ramen for the past month. I only have a few left, and I'm now out of money until Friday. Would be amazing if I could actually eat a real meal for once. Thanks a lot.
1	if this is a real thing and people actually pizza other people, then this might actually be the best day of my life!  I can promise to pay anything forward that comes my way!
1	So I've fallen on some really hard times, and I've never done something like this, but after reading through some of the posts on here, I was taken aback at the kindness of the community, so I figured I'd give it a whirl.  I'm a 24 year old guy, living with two roommates that I absolutely loathe, unemployed for the past 5 months, busting my back looking for a job, and reaching the end of both my money and sanity.  I've been "borrowing" food from my roommates for a couple weeks now, but I hate having to go to them for anything, so I've been relegated to ramen and pickles.  If you've never tried them together, do yourself a favor and DON'T.  So, if someone had the urge and would be willing to help me out, if even for a day, I would be incredibly grateful and appreciative.  Thanks everyone
0	I'm not one for charity, and I don't like to ask things of people. I'm sure that gets said a lot, and words are meaningless, but at some point hunger just has to override pride. I don't know if it's too late for this even to matter, but it's worth a try.
0	Hello,  I've been wanting a pizza for a while and I don't really have much money. This isn't really a sob story though because I can eat something else but I'd love a pizza if someone can gift it.  Here are some random pics of my dog for people cause he's cool and encouraged me to want pizza: http://imgur.com/a/Vudjt  Also this is in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area) in Ontario. Any questions about this request are welcome :D  Anyways thanks RAOP and have a good day! 
0	She can't stop eating! She keeps nibbling on chocolate and snacks, her favourite is.. you guessed it, pizza! 
1	I feel kind of guilty asking this, because I'm usually the person helping out others, not the one looking for help. I just finished my summer term last night and wanted to celebrate somehow, and pizza is the go-to food for college students, right? Well, I wanted to order some Domino's last night for a night of PS3 fun but quickly realized it wasn't financially feasible at the time. In fact, I can't even get 10 bucks worth of gas right now to leave my apartment.  If you want, I can get screen shots of my grades to verify. And I **WILL** pay it forward when I get paid next month (my only income is from the GI Bill, as I am unemployed right now). I'll send you the link when I do and of course I will thank you on here, publicly.
0	Hey yalls, I just fuond out about this reddit. I just moved to a new city via train with everything I own on my back. I have a job but I don't get paid until Friday. I'm currently renting a room from a friend while I save for an apartment. Unfortunately I don't have any money to pay him in rent, he says it's okay but I still feel guilty. I would love to surprise him with a pizza for being so awesome since I can't afford to help him out with bills. Thanks Reddit, I'll promise to pay it forward when I get paid!  EDIT: roastedbagel is awesome! Thanks again RAOP, This subreddit is the best! I know I'll be back again [as an offer-er] soon! 
0	Give me your mission and if my response pleases you, feel free to send me a pizza.   Or just make me do something for free if you decide to not send me a pizza, that's fine. Go on a power trip to see how far I will go for a potential pizza? That's fine. I am not "in need" but I will do some random things for random pizza.   
0	My power was out for about 3 hours earlier this afternoon. I keep trying to watch DVD's (Twister...I mean when in Rome, right?) but as soon as I get halfway in the power either flickers on and off or stays off for an extended period of time. I don't feel up to going out for food either since I've been sick for about 3 days now and Hurricane Irene is being a bitch...  Thank you all!
0	I just moved to a new city 2000 miles away from home, Oklahoma to Oregon, and am craving some pizza. I don't know the area very well and am a bit homesick. It would be awesome and make me feel a little better! Thank you very much! 
0	23 year old guy and I'm just really craving something hot to eat. If there's anyone out there willing enough to look out I'd definitely pay it forward at my earliest convenience. Thanks guys.
1	Been following RAOP for a while for the d'aww of it and upvoting people who need it.  25 y/o here, I've always been independent so this is a little weird for me.  I was laid off from my job of 4 years 3 weeks ago.  After an intense job search, I was hired into an OK paying new job a week later(dancedancedance!) and everything is going fantastic there.  Their pay schedule is harsh (paid in arrears 1 week + 2 week delay = 3 weeks no pay) and I'm not due for a pay check until Friday.  My final paycheck  from my last job went into paying rent/keeping the power on/getting a bus pass etc etc. I'm the frugal type but even with my efficient spending, over the last few weeks I've dropped a lot of weight (down to 5'10" 125lbs). So just putting this out there since I'm darn hungry. Any kindness will be returned in the form of filling a request when I'm back up and running financially.  Vancouver, Washington is right next to Portland, Oregon. ... Northwest USA.  Thank you all for reading and for being there.  Happy Holidays to everyone!
1	I am part of a team of four AmeriCorps VISTAs about 45 minutes south of Cleveland Ohio, and we only make around $900 a month. If you don't know what AmeriCorp is, check out www.americorps.gov. Two of us work on a financial literacy program that offers classes on banking, credit, etc., and myself and another person work on a program that helps empower individuals to become self-sustaining through education and a community based mentorship program.  I would really like to get my teammates pizza for for lunch today. I'd get us all pizza myself if I could afford it! We typically all bring in our own lunches, but sandwiches, bagels, and leftovers are getting a bit old.   Thanks in advance! I can, and will, provide a picture as a thank you.   
0	My hours at work got cut which has put me into a financial bind. I'm looking for other work, but right now I don't have a lot of money. On top of that, I recently found out my grandpa's health is deteriorating, which just adds to the stress of everything. I'm just one 22 year old guy, but I'm really tired and stressed out, and could use some delicious pizza to temporarily ease my woes. I have some strong job prospects coming up, and as soon as my money isn't so tight, I will absolutely pay it forward. 
0	Hello RAOP. We are 3 guys at work and would like a Pizza we are broke. and lunch time is coming fast. we are starving could you help?  We only have a pizza hut in our little town and its a call in I can give you the number if needed. We will return the favor asap. Thanks so much in advance.   Edit: Flippin Arkansas. ( yes its a real town.)
1	My Mom just returned from trying to buy groceries and believes she was robbed while she turned her back from her cart. About $200 was taken from her wallet and so now we're out that money and groceries from tonight. Salt on the wound is that, upon reflection, she realized a man had been shadowing her almost the whole time in an almost empty store and the store doesn't have video cameras.  My husband and I are down visiting, so it's 5 adults total. If you could spare enough for about 2 pizzas, you'd be doing us a great favor.
1	Hi Everyone!  First time requester here and thanks for reading. I'd like to request a pizza for my partner of 7 years. I think it'd be a really nice surprise for him and he loves Reddit as much as I do, so it'd give him one heck of a smile. If you're interested, I want to provide some history so you know where I'm coming from and why I'd like to see that smile. I'll try to provide enough context without being too verbose :)  About 3 years ago I lost my job in marketing. I was the breadwinner in the relationship and he worked for fun, really. I set out to find another job at the start of the recession and it didn't go so well.  After about a year of being unemployed, living off savings and looking for another job that would pay enough for me to pay my bills (a big concern that stopped me from taking a lot of jobs due to pay requirements... we all have to service our debt obligations!)  I realized I hated what I was doing. I was 25 then... 2 years ago.   It's strange and hard to describe, I think, unless you've gone through something similar. I worked hard, ever since I was 13 and had a paper route that earned me a couple hundred a month. When I was 16 I got a job at Best Buy and that's when my 'career' in sales took off. I sold on the Best Buy floor for about a year, then went to CompUSA where I worked as a commissioned sales guy. My first commission job and I was only 17. I made really good money and continued to progress through retail and then into retail marketing.   By the time I was entering college I was making more than most people who had been out of college for years, and that number went up every year. That kind of money blinded me to the fact that I wasn't enjoying what I was doing... I was enjoying making and spending money. So much so that I burned through it faster than I made it. It was really the only thing I had fun doing, though. I dropped out of college (probably a good thing, since I was going for a degree I wouldn't want now).  I met my partner through Myspace at about the time I had gotten my first management position and was traveling 90% of the time. The first couple years were great. I was gone so much it was like a long honeymoon. Sometimes he'd come with me; Vegas, NYC, Seattle... etc.   For his part he worked off and on. It was never a big deal... I made a lot more money than him. He'd always worked odd retail jobs, hourly stuff, customer service stuff. Never made over $10 an hour or held a job for more than half a year. I didn't care because I'd rather spend my time with him when I was home than have him working and making a couple extra bucks.  So, back to three years ago when I lost my job. After about a year of coming up dry, I fell into a pretty bad depression. I couldn't find work that would pay my bills, and realized that I didn't even like doing that work. It affected our relationship dramatically. I retreated into World of Warcraft and stopped talking to family. Eventually the money ran out and bills stopped getting paid.   I hit bottom after a long, dark period... but thankfully for me bottom was a nice soft pillow of people that loved me. My parents stepped in to help get me through some tough financials and my partner stepped up to support me mentally and financially.   Fast forward to today. My partner is now happily employed (1 year anniversary this month) with a company that is providing him with a promising career opportunity that he loves doing. We've downsized our lives; no car, eating cheap, staying in, cooking and we've moved into a studio apartment. My partner is working we're saving so I can go to school and do something that I do love; be a vet. He even got me a chocolate Labrador puppy in February. We named him Fizban and he's a constant source of joy for me. The person I was 3 years ago would not recognize the person I am today.  I try to do nice things for him whenever possible to lessen the stress of being the sole earner in the house. That's what this request is about. We're not starving, but we live tight. This would not only be a delicious treat for us, but once my partner found out that it came from a generous person on Reddit he will be amazed.  One day I promise to pay it forward. Here's a picture of my dog, Fizban and my partner:  http://imgur.com/SoygY
0	Hi RAOP! This will be my first time requesting your service. I'm currently a senior up here at the University of Idaho, located in the unbelievably small town, Moscow, where the plains are rolling and the smell of cow ass is abundant.  Anyway, this is my second semester of living in an apartment and I'm still working on getting a budget together. Normally I do a fairly good job, but this semesters worth of books cost about double what I had originally planned for. Normally this wouldn't be too much of a problem, but in a town this small it's very hard to find a job. So I was hoping that a nice meal would be just the break I needed before I get back to struggling through the rest of the semester.  Thanks for listening and have a wonderful day. &lt;3
0	Eglin AFB, Fl.  My husband and I live on a military base. We don't get paid until in the am of tomorrow and we are down to no food and 47 cents in our checking. We are so broke because of me. I have illnesses that require medication that our insurance doesn't cover, as they only cover generic. This man has given everything to me and wants to take care of me. I wish I could do the same for him. So please, we need our faith in strangers restored. We will do the same. Please. 
1	I am a college student at oregon state university, and I am studying all day for my  finals this coming week. A hot pizza pie would make my day because there is no better food to study with. I do have some food in my fridge so I am in no way in danger of starving without this pizza, but it would brighten my otherwise dull next couple of days of pure study. I would be sure to pay it forward after my finals and when  I have extra cash I can spend.  Thanks for reading Reddit :)
0	I am a college student doing my best to make it on my own, and have not had money to afford anything but ramen and toast for too long. i'm dying for a delicious pie.
0	So here's my story of why I'm here and why I'm so hungry.  7 Weeks ago my dad said his friend was moving in because she needed a place to stay. She arrived the next day and moved into the downstairs guest bedroom with her baby daughter. Four days later her 12 year old daughter moved in upstairs next to me. My dad never cooks and this is fine because I'll cook for myself and enjoy cooking. But I've noticed the food disappearing more and more, when I asked my father to go shopping he did about 2 weeks later and to my surprise 2 more people moved in. Friends of my dads from Tennessee. They were only here for a week but when they left there was no food again. When I asked my dad if I could go shopping with him he said he didn't have the money to feed all these people and asked the women with the 2 daughters to find a place. It feels like it's been forever and they are still here. There's almost nothing I can make to eat besides ramen and corn. The only thing she buys is junk food but not even anything you would want to eat as a snack. Ice creme, ice creme cake, microwave dinners which I can't eat because it's for her "diet", and baby food.  What I've been doing is just going out and eating but I quit my last job and began to work with my father. It was hard work and good pay but we live in Florida and it's rain so much the past few days we haven't been able to work and he hasn't giving me a paycheck. Like I said there is corn, ramen, and ice creme I CAN eat. I really rather not but if you are generous enough to give someone a pizza, try and find someone in more need than I am. If you can't and decide to help me out I will LOVE YOU!  Thanks for reading and I'll answer any questions.  TL;DR: Guest who've been staying at my house eat everything and leave me nothing. Haven't left after being asked to. I'm terrible at writing.  ::EDIT:: NVM! My mother invited me over to dinner and to pick me up as well. (parents are divorced) A concerned friend also invited me out to dinner and asked if I needed cat food. I have four cats but I assured the friend they are fine and they truly are. I have 2 full bags of cat food. :) Thanks to anyone who read and I'm delighted that I will eat tonight!!!
1	Just paid my rent and now have a scarily small amount of money in my account. Also studying for the worlds dullest exam tomorrow. Would love to have a pizza to go with Match of the Day later! 
0	just left PA to move to new york to couch surf with a friend until next month when my VA check comes in so i have enough money to get a studio apt with 1st months rent and security deposit due , i have zero funds im a disabled vet and had 3 surgical proceedures done last week , i sure would love a warm pizza but most of all i want to share it with my friend to in some way do something nice for her to repay in some small way the kindness and generosity she gave me       thanks , Louie
0	I was looking up for possibility of free pizza and ran across the reddit free pizza at first was hesitant but I thought I give it a try. My girlfriend and I are in a tough spot, my job has yet to pay me my "lost" hours and we are behind with some bills. We have enough money to pay for rent tomorrow but it may be a week or so before we will get above. Does anyone have it in their heart to provide a pizza for us? In return we will pay it forward to your choosing (I have just thought of a unique idea paying it forward) If interested I will share it with you. Thanks for taking the time to read this.
0	[This.](http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lvmvg/i_share_a_birthday_with_the_kid_next_door_this/)  I cannot afford to at the moment, but would anyone be willing to PM the OP and offer some help?
1	thanks for taking the time to read. due to medical circumstances(i work graveyard shifts, have hard time sleeping during the day, dental visits), i haven't been able to work the past week. therefore, i wont be getting a paycheck this week. i had just enough to scrape by my bills, and put enough gas in my car to get me to work and back this week so i can have a paycheck(finally) on the 20th. im usually ahead of the game/curve, pay my stuff early, etc. its just been a rough month.  if anyone feels like being generous, i only have one condition-let me do something in return. you name it(within reason) as long as it is very frugal in nature. i can write you a letter/card, valentines day card if you're a lady redditor. i can make pictures of my kitty. something along those lines. again, thanks for reading.   EDIT- /u/niteflirtgirl is a Pizza Hut secret delivery agent. THANKS
1	-I'm located in Virginia. It would be great to have some pizza tonight, feeling under the weather. I don't get paid until the weekend, and this would make our day. 
0	I want a pizza.  My husband hates pizza.  We never eat pizza.  If you buy me one I won't give him any.  Short. Sweet. To the point.  
1	Freelance worker here, currently my funds are all stuck in PayPal. I'm willing to do a fair trade if somebody can order me a pizza! I'm willing to pay double for the order!
0	He has the car with my wallet inside of it, so I'm stranded here with no money or transportation. I think a pizza might help calm my rage. 
0	So I'm pretty broke this month and just heard from work that I wont be needed for a few weeks meaning that I don't have any money coming in for a while. I heard this after getting back from a full day in uni and with a few hours of reading to do tonight so I would really appreciate some pizza. In return I will pay the favour forward when I get money again and send the redditor who makes me smile a story of some kind or photos of me looking happy :) please help me random knights of the internet.  EDIT: location is uk
1	Just hoping someone could help me out tonight with some pizza. Money is tight, and food is low. I start a new job next week so i wanted something to celebrate with rather than soup and crackers again. Thanks for your time and consideration.
0	So here's the scoop — I have a few ingredients from which I might be able to pull together a meal. However, I am working on deadline right now trying to get a business off the ground. I'm hungry as hell but I don't have time to get creative in the kitchen, I'll be working til after midnight at least as it is.  Pizza delivery would solve my time and hunger issues however I won't have any money until tomorrow night (11/27).  Anyone care to spot me a pizza? I can pay it forward (or back) in about a week if you wish. (Possibly as long as 2 weeks, but probably not that long)  I'm a longtime redditor, this is my regular Reddit account, I have a spankin' new verification code, and I have a record of repayment over at r/assistance though I only asked there once.  If you spot me a pizza, I'll sing a song for you and post a link to the mp3! (After deadline which means, tomorrow night)
0	No long sad backstory, just me and my friend, no money, and a realllly craving some pizza, so help out, next time i'll fulfill someone else's pizza request.
0	I'm craving pizza right now, but no way to aquire.. I don't usually take handouts, let alone blatantly ask for them, but pizza...
0	Hi I am in Blantyre Malawi (New Naperi) and would be grateful for a plain cheese pizza
0	Hi guys i'm  new to this site.. so I guess i'm just supposed to tell my story... alright here it goes lol.. I am a single mother of two.. no sob story don't worry.. I just graduated High School i did it online at Pennfoster.edu I do have a job but unfortunately don't get paid until friday. I will pay someone back or give a pizza on Friday. I'm just so excited I finally graduated by the way i'm 20 and could really use a warm pizza until I go grocery shopping on Friday!! thanks for reading :) 
0	Been living off ramen and beans 'n rice for the past few weeks. Ate my last ramen yesterday for lunch. Don't have much to offer but I'll do what I can to trade.
0	The year has started great so far. I've moved in to a new apartment , freelance business is picking up, and my part time job is giving me more hours!  Unfortunately I'm without food until my paycheck goes in next week.  Anyone interested in helping out?  I'm willing to pay it forward once I have the means.
1	Keeping an eye on them all is a chore, help with dinner tonight would be greatly appreciated! I'll be sure to pay-it-forward when I can.
0	Hello,  We just got done moving our older brothers and their children in with us, we used to be a family of 4 but we have grown it seems overnight.  We just moved into a bigger home to accommodate everyone here but now we have nothing left for food until Thursday night.  I understand that there are many on here who need this more then my family and if you overlook us to give to them, then God bless you.  But if anyone out there wants to throw us a pizza lifeline this evening it would be most appreciated. 
1	Ran out of food this week, can't buy anything for another two days. I'll happily draw a humanoid character portrait for anyone who can get something headed my way!  Examples of my art, and the style and quality I'm willing to draw: http://imgur.com/A6CQbrp http://imgur.com/KDKJCj0  (crossposted to [the other RAoP](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPizza/comments/1gn9st/request_drawings_for_pizza_in_nsw_australia/) because I don't know how to Reddit v well :( )
0	My fiancee and I are usualy broke as my fiancee is on disability and I stay at home to take care of her. A pizza would be a wonderful treat for us.  Thanks! -Mac
0	I'm 23 years old, graduated from college this past december, when doing so I lost my on campus job. After that, I interned on a feature film for a month, meaning I worked at least 12 hours a day, for no pay. Since then, I've done my best to find a new job, but I live in a smaller, rural area, meaning there's not a whole lot of jobs to go around. This is my first post on this subreddit, but basically, I love pizza, and I would just love to eat. Thanks for reading.  EDIT: Just found out that because my mom was forced into early retirement, she has to pay $10,000 a year in income taxes for the next few years. So the $30 I have, is what I have.
1	Our family has been going through a rough time lately. We were involved in a car accident on Thanksgiving, and the other driver (who was at fault) was uninsured. My husband was fairly significantly injured, and dealing with the hassles of medical bills, doctor and surgeon appointments, and suing for damages, on top of resuming school/teaching this week (I'm a graduate student) has left me emotionally, physically, and financially drained.   We have three small kids, and I'm sure pizza would be a huge hit, as we haven't bought food from a restaurant in a LONG time. If anyone would be willing to save me from cooking tonight, I would be eternally grateful.
1	I'm an art student and I do Web Development to support myself. I've been waiting to get paid for a week, and am close to running out of food completely. Can't buy anymore till I get the check in the mail. Chances are it won't be here till Monday at the earliest.  A pizza would really raise my spirits. I live in the Chicago area.
0	I went out with some friends earlier in the week and ended up lending my friend 20 bucks til he could get to an ATM. Long story short, we ended up pretty silly drunk and crashed at different houses so he never got a chance to pay me back.  I get paid tomorrow and I could definitely tough it out, but I'd love to down a few slices before I spend the night cleaning up my apartment.   
0	I just moved back to Brooklyn and slept on a living room couch for the past month. I am currently subletting an apartment but don't have a full time job. That means rent comes before food. I worked from 4pm on sunday to 6am this morning doing labor at the metropolitan museum and didn't eat during that time. Please help and when I am capable I will pay it forward. Thanks.
0	So I am totally car-less. I wanted to know if this website is for real. Free pizza?:D I'm up for that! I haven't had pizza in ages! I live in a town in the middle of absolutely nothing.  I can't drive anywhere. Help?
0	Title says it all.  Don't have enough money for any type of food right now, nonetheless pizza.  If this works, I will be floored. :)  Have a good night everybody!
0	Here is my story. My mother is finally done with getting treated for breast cancer but with all the treatments we have had to cut back on a few things. We never go out to eat and we try to limit our food usage because we need to save our money for getting two cars fixed and get a new/used car that my parents can use for work. My dad has his own business but he only does small things so not much money comes in that way. My mom gets up at 5 in the morning sometimes earlier so she can get extra hours to get more money and being in a small town I have gotten a job as a babysitter but need to keep missing days because I have teeth problems. I have to go back to school next year to finish the classes I missed from being in a very abusive relationship so more money will be put towards that. It would be nice if one day I came home with supper in hand for us and eat as a family. If anyone needs proof or knows more information then contact me I live in Ogema, WI and i am 18.  I have gotten help!
1	Hey guys-  Welp, tonight I am dinnerless.  I work in video production under freelance contracts, and my client said he cannot pay me on time like he was supposed to.  Unfortunately, that means no dinner for me tonight.  Just wondering if anyone can help a first time pizza requester out.  If I do find a kind person around these parts, I will definitely be giving back the second I get paid, not to try to make that any leverage, but this seems like an amazing idea that I would love to support for the future.  I live in Lakewood, CO, so there are a fair amount of choices that are taunting me... ;)  Thanks for taking the time to read this... ~Slade
1	So the story is simple.  Due to a miscommunication with my family I will not be able to have Christmas dinner with them this year.  To top matters off my wife lost her debit card (with access to her cash) and I had a credit card payment (that I scheduled and forgot about) and a car insurance payment drop me into the red until payday this Friday.  So I'm feeling bummed and really could use a pie tonight if anyone is feeling generous.  Edit: Wifes debit card came in the mail last night so we are no longer broke.  Thanks for everyone who looked at this and thanks Styx9001 for the offer but things aren't looking quite as depressing as before!  Merry Christmas (or winter holiday of your choice!) ^.^
0	I got a coupon in the mail last time I ordered from Dominos for a free medium pizza next time I place an order. Well today's the last day it's valid and I am completely busted. Would anyone please be kind enough to float me a gift card to Dominos so I can get something to eat and get to use my coupon? It seems like a shame to let it go to waste. If you can  hook me up than thank you, if not its but it's not the end of the world. Thanks Random Acters.
1	My husband has to work 7-5 and class from 530-930 on my bday, so I just wanna order some pizza and read a book to occupy myself tomorrow. Anyone wanna hook it up with a pizza? 
0	Hi there. I'm at school 100+km away from home and the school just took a tuition payment. Have nothing to eat until Thursday when I get money so a pizza would be greatly appreciated. I could ration it throughout the week. Anything helps if possible, thanks! 
1	Woke up 6 this morning puking. Haven't had any food all day, but now my appetite is coming back but I have no food. Anything would help and be greatly appreciated. 
0	Hey everyone! Today is my now 8 year old son Logans b-day and we kinda strapped for cash so i was wondering if anyone could bless him with just 1 pizza for tonight. I hate to ask but it'd really make his day, he loves pizza more then anything lol. Thank you all so much :)
1	FIRST OF ALL I DON'T NEED THIS PIZZA.  There seems to be a lot of people that do so go to them first.  But I do love the whole idea of the subreddit and thought it'd be fun to try. I religiously love pizza. :)
0	My partner is a wonderful gender-queer pansexual and after six-months I am still enamored. We live in the Barrio of North West Dallas and love-it. While I looked for a tech support job, my partner bit the bullet and took a burger job (albiet, fancy burger place; they refer to it as eco-capitalist.)  We would love a pizza with meat on it (although we are queer activists we do not dabble in granolaheadary.)   What you will get in return: we will personally write you a thank you card and send you a pizza in return. I will make my personal number available to your elderly relatives; so that I can tell them to unplug their router and restart their Windows 98 when their internets aren't firing.
0	The entirety of my last paycheck went to paying rent and I just moved into my new apartment so I have very little food. If anyone is willing to provide me with food tonight I would be forever grateful.
1	Like the title says I'm in a tight spot and could really use a warm pizza to lift my spirits and give me a break from KD. As it stands I won't be able to both pay bills and afford groceries when I get paid so this would be a huge boost. I'm a long time redditor and am happy to PM you from my main account to verify this as well as provide any other info you would like.    EDIT: Thanks to the wonderful DEStudent I will be having pizza for supper! Thank you so much!
0	Hey citizens of Random_Acts_of_Pizza!  NYC-based actor/ retail drone, broke (overdrafted at the moment) until paycheck deposits tomorrow.  Caught a weird head cold this week (better now!) and missed some shifts at work, had some family drama, and dealing with this awful heat and humidity. A sensible pizza could get me fed and happy until I can get paid and to the grocery store tomorrow. I can only eat so much cous cous in one weekend!  I've never posted here before - but I fully intend to "Pizza-It-Forward" when I'm back on my feet a bit more.  Happy June, everyone!   EDIT: added some more info!
0	Hey all.  I fractured my ankle in 3 places Friday night, and am currently stuck in my bed on pain medication with no easily accessible food. None of my roommates are home until later tonight, and I am absolutely starving! I am not working at the moment due to my fractured ankle, so I am trying to save as much money as possible to pay for my bills, etc..  I would really appreciate some pizza right now! I will be sure to return the favor when I am in better fortunes.  Thank you so much!  EDIT: Picture of my cast! http://i.imgur.com/vciRBM4.jpg
0	we don't have anything to eat anywhere in the house at all and need a hot meal to feed us.and the our car's gas tank is leaking at the bottom of the tank so when we put gas in it it comes right back out the bottom of the tank so we went and bought a new one and nobody to put it on right now and my wifes been in and out of the er almost every day with asthma attacks and we need some help with food please and thank you so much.
0	Yeah, it had my debit card in it so I've got no access to cash at the minute and an empty fridge save for a cabbage. I'd love a little pick me up!
0	Hi, I actually hate asking for this but I'll pay it forward! Got laid off from my job and have ran out of food a week ago. I have been fine tho, but after losing weight my appetite has come back with a vengeance and I still have to wait another week before I get some support money. So have to put a request out there. Thank you (:
1	With Boston and all I'm pretty much on the bottom of the food chain but I'm at the point where I'm returning bottles to make Bus fare to get to work. Working while starving is killing my performance to point people are noticing and the spiral downward is starting. I'd have pawned the machine I'm typing on if could have found a shop that would take it. I'm getting paid soon and I'll be sending out pizza as soon as I can. I'm in upstate NY.
0	My Girlfriend and I are down on our luck and getting desperate. I lost my job at the start of the summer and we've been floating by just barely managing to keep the rent covered. We've both been looking for jobs very actively, just haven't had any luck at all. We've got a bit of cash on the way next week, but no money until then. Not complaining about all that, but we haven't eaten in nearly three days and we're getting damn hungry. I'm more than happy to repay this favor in the future if someone would help us out tonight. 
1	As title says I would love some pizza love action tonight!
0	We don't get paid until Thursday so can't hit the grocery store until then, but the kids and I sure would love some pizza tonight. Anyone want to make our night?
1	Like the title says.  Been so sick that I can't even go grocery shopping.  I'd order my own but I'm on a tight budget right now and not working for a week has kind of screwed me.  Ran out of ramen today and I just heard of this sub so I figured I'd give it a shot.   I'll gladly reimburse in a few weeks. 
0	(Request) student just it done with finals. Would love a nice warm pizza to celebrate :)  EDIT: in central IL  
0	We're not in the biggest of pickles, but let us plead or case.  &lt;in Pocatello, ID for work. Been here for about a week but haven't been paid yet. &lt;ran out of money two days ago, and went through the rest of our raman. &lt;dying for dinner.  Two 23year-old painters could really use a pizza. And I promise if this works I'll pay it back with a large as soon as I get back to Colorado.
0	Plus, my S.O. took the laptop, so I'm typing this on my kindle.
0	Hi I am new to reddit but my best friend told me to submit a request here because  a) I want pizza b) I lost my debit card and have no cash c) my boyfriend (who I moved across the state to live with and have done countless things for) just broke up with me and I only have 1 beer  d) these are my [cat pants](http://i50.tinypic.com/jkyn3t.jpg)
0	Please and thank you!
0	My girlfriend and I just moved into a new apartment after being homeless for a week and half. Our cubbords are empty and the week + of homelessness drained both our bank accounts. To top things off, I've contracted a flu like sickness and can't help around the new place much just quite yet. Some warm food would be greatly appreciated. 
0	Basically, like the title says, I got paid yesterday, and after putting gas in the car and paying rent, I have $1 dollar to my name and no groceries. I start a new job Monday, with a big increase in pay, so I won't struggle like this anymore. When I get the first paycheck, I'll pay it forward to the person who helped me or to someone else on here.   I'm in Southern Indiana.   Thanks!
0	I've been eating saltine crackers all day :/
0	Title says it all...Studying for finals, pretty broke, dining halls are too expensive and I don't have money for a meal. Would love a pizza to help me get through this night...could even give you a Rift 60 day time card from when I used to play, i've had it forever.  Any help would be SERIOUSLY appreciated! Thanks!
0	I'm not poor. I'm not sick. I'm not angry or upset at life. I don't particularly need my day cheered up, it has been pretty cool on its own. I am however hungry. 
1	Proof: http://imgur.com/7UrIW  Any size pizza from any pizza chain will be highly appreciated!  Thank you!
0	He's always looked out for me and I would like to return the favor. He came home as a surprise to us which is great, but i can't celebrate because my girlfriend, son, and myself are going to be moving to a new apartment next month so we're on a very tight budget. We live near Pizza Hut and Domino's. Any help would be greatly appreciated, thank you.  I would be more than willing to provide proof in any way possible.
0	Hi guys, Anderson/Clemson, SC area here. My roommates and I are broke and could use a pizza to eat tonight.  Three of us just got new jobs but we are stretched a little thin from moving into a new place.  Our cash flow is pretty screwed until next week.  I will provide any sort of verification that you could want.  I've been lurking reddit since the digg v4 thing but I just signed up for an account 6 months ago, although I rarely login.  Also, I have a SoftLayer dedicated server that I'd be willing to give you some space on for web hosting / FTP / data backup. (The server is paid up for several more months so you'd get plenty of value from it!)  If somebody can come through for us, that would be awesome!
0	So yeah. I'm starving and it's midnight. I don't have a sad story. I just want me some pizza. Preferably a Jet's eCard. I'd appreciate it if you did sent it to me :D
0	Just like the title says, I have no food at my house and no money to buy any with. At least not for the next week. Pretty sure I could make a pizza go pretty far.   (I guess that's a lie...I have some protein powder on top of my fridge).   Located in San Francisco, CA!
0	Hey guys, I'm in a tough situation and my mom has no money. She gets paid every second Wed. of the month and I've had Ramen Noodles and Mac N Cheese for the past week for Lunch and Dinner. It would be amazing if someone can help me out. I would be willing to barter with pics of my cat doing goofy stuff. 
1	I've got $0.90 to my name. And her next few paychecks are going to medical bills. I don't get paid till Monday. We'd be more than appreciative if we had some real food. Thanks.
1	I only just realized Halloween was my cake day so I've never celebrated it before. Anybody want to send some celebration toward Washington state?   Edit: Ryzome has PM'd me with an offer. I'll update soon with a thank you post once it arrives. 
1	This is my first post here but basically I have lost my college ID, which is used to get into our dining halls. It costs 25 dollars to replace and I just don't have that money right now. I've been eating ramen since Saturday and would like some pizza as I wait for the 21st to arrive so I can get a replacement ID.
0	My dad lost his job in the last few weeks, I'm in school and working on getting a job but until then I haven't been spending on anything really.  I'd really love a pizza to enjoy while watching the Blues V. Hawks game tonight with my girlfriend Location: Illinois
0	I had to move back in with my parents, I share a room with my parents computer and have to wear a bandana as a blindfold so I can sleep since that light just HAS to be on. A full stomach of pizza would make me sleep better.
0	EDIT:  A redidt-donor who wishes to not be named had helped me greatly with more than a pizza!  Thanks so much!   ------  I recently suffered a lower back injury putting me out of work until I recover completely and I am waiting on my next cheque from the workers compensation board and trying to make my current grocery situation (instant noodles and chicken noodle soup) last as long as I can.  A small break from noodles for a night would be greatly appreciated.  Snip of the current balance. http://i.imgur.com/jWtYr.jpg
0	I live in bristol stoke gifford and really need a pizza. I need a pizza because i really need to make my sister happy again shes kind of depressed and i know how much she loves pizza so this would be perfect treat for her. Her favourite type is meat pizza but others will do fine.  Thanks :)
0	Hey Redditors!  I will give you the code for a new $25 Nike gift card in exchange for just $20 of pizza! I am super hungry for pizza but all I have is this damn Nike gift card. Help me eat and I'll help you buy stuff!  Thanks everyone
0	My mother left for work around 6:30 this morning and will more than likely be home extremely late tonight, being that my cousin is in the hospital &amp; she's gone to see him every day since he's been hospitalized. She left us $20 on the kitchen table, but my sister was called into work &amp; needed cab fair. Now my brother, sister &amp; I have nothing to eat today. We won't die, but help would be greatly appreciated.
1	I am so hungry, me and my roommate have had only saltine crackers to eat for like the last 2 days, we spend all our money on our bills :(  the groceries are the last thing to stock for the sake of everyone always coming to our place to eat our food. Everything has been really short lately and it just sucks! , If you could help out in any way that would be amazing. It would be very filling and a great surprise for my roommate...I would pay it forward in due time to someone else in need.  thank you, &lt;3  here is me, starving : http://i.imgur.com/GYmNY.jpg 
0	I am a high school kid supporting myself. I get paychecks biweekly and I have ~$1 in my bank account. I usually eat breakfast and lunch at school, but this week is February break. A pizza would hold me over until pay day. I get paid on Thursday and I will gladly return the favor then, twice even! 
0	I used to work for a magazine company as a designer. There were multiple red flags that it was a really terrible place to work. My boss was nuts and employment there was like a revolving door. He fired me without cause about two months ago and since then I've been struggling a bit ands currently starting to sell possessions in order to buy food. I live in Chicago, IL and would really really appreciate a pizza... Thank you 
0	I've never done this before, so I'm not sure if I'm even doing it right. 
1	I have ~20 bucks on me since I sent the rent check off yesterday, and I hate asking my parents for cash when I get paid from my job on the 15th. I'm at work now (on campus job) and don't really want to eat Pop Tarts for dinner. There's a Dominos next to campus that always has cheap student specials, but I want to try and make my 20 dollars last as long as possible simply because I don't want to ask for bailout from my parents (trying to actually be an adult and make a living for myself.)  It's okay if you guys want to give to someone more needy! I just kinda thought I'd try and see if this struck with anyone familiar with the situation! Best of luck to everyone out there!
0	I am embarrassed to ask...but I started a new job a week ago (no paycheck for two weeks) and my kids have been eating rice for three days.  They have been far more understanding than they had to be.  I would really love to give them something special tonight (but I cannot).  If any one could help save them from yet another night of white rice, I would be most grateful.   And would love to pay it forward when I get paid next week! 
1	I am an out of work phlebotomist struggling to get by at the moment while I find another hospital to work at.  The bills are piling up and I have no money to pay them.  What bothers me the most about my situation is that my boyfriend, who is super patient and cooperative with me while i'm losing my mind trying to find a job, helps me however I need to whether it is financial or a simple hug at the end of his long day to cheer me up a bit.  I am very upset that I lost my independence...  My boyfriend has been on a diet (Keto) for a few months, and he has decided that he is going to have a "cheat day" on his birthday which is in a few days. He has been my rock through these long months and I have nothing to give to him and no money to buy him a gift or even cook him something for his cheat day.  He has done so much for me and all I want to do is give something back to him.  If there is anyone out there that can help me out on his birthday, I'd be so happy!  Even if I can't get a proper gift for him, I think pizza on one of his cheat days should suffice :)  Once I get back on my feet, I am going to send a pizza to some lovely redditors to return the kindness.  
0	I've never done this before and I'm not sure what to expect but this has been one hell of a week.   I and my boyfriend are on a weird pay week, which means we won't be paid til next monday.   All our bills are paid, so we're fine there. However, he (the boy) has been working overtime like crazy and yesterday he had a blowout of his back tire and we had to get all four of his tires replaced.   If someone is feeling generous, I would love to feel the love.   Thanks guys and even if no one answers my call, I've noticed how many pizzas have been gifted to people who really need it and you guys are awesome! Keep being amazing and thanks! Oh! Before I forget, I'm in Pasadena, CA. I know location is important!   EDIT: 8:07 and my boy still hasn't left for home from work.   EDIT: 8:36 and he FINALLY just got off work.
0	Hey guys, my per diem check never came and we were counting on it We are paying rent today (late as is) And we won't have any money left for the rest of the week.  I budget like crazy but my SO had to go away to.work for a week, so he had to pay to love separately from us. So we are very behind and broke.  Well the check hasn't come and was suppose to be here a week ago.  I will return the favor in a few weeks when we get all caught up.  Anyone want to help a girl out? Much appreciated! 
1	Trying to set up a surprise romantic evening for my hubby and I.  Only detail is that we are vegan, however there is a nice place close by that offers a large, 1 topping, for $10, that is made with vegan cheese and they have vegan toppings. I have all the other "components" for the evening ready to go, just need the pizza. Thanks in advance.  PS. I promise to post pics!
0	If you don't like my poem, don't buy. I prefer the Papa.
0	Hi! I've had a crappy pay period. Got paid today and poof, it's gone. I would dance with glee if someone gave me a pizza for me and one cat (she will get one pepperoni, which she will beg for, but then lose interest once I give it to her.) Anyone care to build me a smile?
0	I lost my debit card and the food in my apartment consists of a granola bar. If someone would send me a pizza so i could eat tonight that would be awesome!
1	Graduated and I've yet to find a job but prospects look better now. Still unemployed and just got a letter saying my internet and phone service will be shut off soon. was hoping a kind redditor could help me out with a pizza and something sweet for dinner. 
0	Just me and the wife at home today, she is in bed sick, don't feel like cooking since its my only day off this week, would love a pizza.
0	Didn't want to use my normal reddit username, as I have friends and family I'd rather not have see me in such a way, hope that's ok.
0	I'm resubmitting this from a few minutes ago because I didn't read.   Anyway, just rode my scooter to work in the rain. Wonderful weather. I could really go for a pizza.
1	Hey RAOP community, my girlfriend and I just got back from a night of exercising, and we really worked up an appetite. I'd truly appreciate a steaming, saucy, cheesy, delicious, pizza to share with her.  Thanks guys!
0	Busy and hungry university student in Edmonton, Alberta CA would lurrrrve a break from ramen noodles by way of pizza. Hot, melty good times please! :)
0	I made a throwaway account because I hate asking for things :(   But I don't get paid until friday and I had to pay auto repair shit (hit a high curb) I was wondering If I could get enough to purchase just 1 pizza from pizza hut and a drink.   I can buy a pizza for the person on Friday when I get paid.
1	Thank you so much for the pizza Trisha!
1	OK so here goes my story. I'm an apprentice glassblower and computer guy. Last weekend my fridge died spoiling all of the groceries I had for the week and I literally haven't eaten anything since Monday morning.  My bank account is overdrawn by 40 dollars, have no cash to my name and will not be paid until Friday. I make glass pendants and marbles and will gladly trade someone glasswork next week for a pizza today.   Edit: Can provide screenshot of overdrawn bank account as proof if requested.
0	Hello, all five of my roommates have gone for the evening of whom are wonderful cooks which I incessantly feed myself from, but tonight there are no leftovers and no food in the house and no vehicle. I'd love a pizza if there is one to spare. :)  I could offer something in return, but my skills are limited only to graphic design/digital arts, drawing, and painting. I could send a little thank you if you wanted!  Thanks   edit: I live in Athens, GA
0	Basically I had unexpected expenses this month out of money and desperate for a pizza.   I Have a Tera account with level 48 Beserker and the account has founder status.Its not much but only thing i have right now that i can live without. Eating is much higher on my priority list right now than playing Tera.   If you don't want the account I will be happy to pay it forward to someone this friday when I get my paycheck.
0	Not exactly the most exciting offer ever but I'm really hungry and willing to embarrass myself with permanent marker drawings in exchange for a pizza.  I don't have any drawing skills but I will try my hungry heart out for you.
0	It's been a very tight two weeks, and the wife and I are approaching Friday with a very empty wallet.  We have enough gas in the car to get to and from work, but not enough fuel for our bellies.  We're rocking a solid two chicken breasts in the freezer - adequate for one night's dinner.  We're sitting pretty on a whopping ninety-six cent til Friday morning, and getting desperate as to what we're doing for dinner Wednesday or Thursday.  And then I heard about RAOP.  I promise to whomever helps my wife and I in our time of need that we will pass the good fortune on come Friday.  Thank you for reading this, and thank you for browsing this amazing subreddit.
0	I was expecting to see a dramatic increase in my checking account at midnight…no joy. Anyone want to be a kind soul and loan a recent college grad a pizza?
0	Some unexpected medical bills came up and I ended up completely broke.  I haven't eaten since Tuesday morning and I can't describe how hungry I am.  If someone, anyone, can help me out today I would be eternally in your debt.  
0	No food in house, no money. Help would be appreciated. Thanks
0	Out of the 4 of us only one of us is able to work. I thought it the right thing to do and try to relax with some pizza that won't cut into the bills. Thank you.
0	my friend is coming in town for the weekend and my friends and i are so excited because we haven't seen him since junior high. we are going to a high school football game then to the dollar theater after and it would be so nice if someone fed us before we embarked :) this is my first post!
1	Nothing in the fridge and a delicious pizza would be amazing right about now. No sob stories or anything, just an honest hankering for tasty pizza. Plus I'm playing Dark Souls and I need fuel to make it through Tomb of Giants ;)
0	I'm a sophomore female at the university of Illinois. I'm a double major in finance and computer science and have been studying in my office cubicle (because it's quiet here at night and the internet is really freaking fast) for a little over 15 hours now. Anyway, I was just taking a quick reddit break, and thought I'd try. I'm really hungry! 
0	Hey guys,  My story is no where as bad as everyone else's on here, but I would love to catch a break from someone if they are willing and able.  I was laid off last week from my job of 5 years, they are downsizing, which I guess means my boss is taking a bigger paycheck this year and I was expendable.  For the cherry on top, my old '93 Honda Civic broke down on me, it's sitting in the shop, and I don't want to pay for that POS to be fixed, but I have no other offers.  I'm a single guy, no girlfriend or wife or children that I know of, so I don't have a lot of mouths to feed, but I would love to at least stuff my face with something greasy and warm tonight and wallow in my sorrows.  Thanks reddit, you guys are all awesome.  
0	I'm a father of 2 kids, a 5 year old boy and a 7 year old girl.  Its summer break so im home with them during the day.  No cash until Friday and, though they wont complain if I give them another PBJ, I know they'd really dig some pizza! 
0	Starving, no money, no food...please reach out.
0	I commute two hours everyday and left my wallet at home. Simple as that. I will for sure be "paying it forward" as soon as can if I am blessed with some pizza. I have a long day ahead of me and am self employed so I hope that someone will be kind enough to za me. 
0	My family and I would really love to catch a break.  It feels like the last few months have just been nothing but bad news, from my wife losing her job, our family car breaking down and requiring over $3500 to fix it, my job cutting hours and pay, just a whole bunch of negative stuff we're going through.  My two daughters and son are my rock and my world, why I get out of bed in the morning to work a job where I'm underpaid and busting my back day in and day out.  I would love to be able to surprise them with a nice little pizza treat at some point, try to boost their spirits during this rough patch in our lives.  I would love to be on here with a different story, one in which I'm able to give out pizza to those struggling within the community, and hopefully, who knows, I might be able to at some point.  All I know is that I will pay it forward in any way possible when I can.
1	I am currently between jobs, although I have one offer that is almost a done deal and I should begin working soon. I am struggling with my bills at the moment, although I'm seeking help from friends and family. My fridge is really bare, and any spare money I have is currently going toward paying my rent. "Luckily," I recently got a concussion and haven't had much of an appetite, so I can make what little food I get last longer. If anyone could help me eat for a few days, I would be incredibly grateful. I'll also pay it back as soon as I get back up on my feet, which hopefully won't be long.   Thanks so much!
0	I've never asked and I've never pizza'd. I would love a pizza for lunch...um, I have no sob story. I'm unemployed? Does that help?
0	Hello, I just heard of this site. My family is going through some rough times right now, there are 4 of us, my father, my 2 sisters, and myself. My oldest sister and I are out of work. My father was too, but he just found a job a week or so ago. My sister and I have been looking for jobs for a while, but we only have one car at the moment, so it's hard to find an employer who is willing to work with someone else's schedule. I have applied at all the places within walking distance to our house, but we live in a really small town, and all of our small-town businesses are suffering. We've been spending the past week packing, because we are in the process of losing our house. We do have food stamps, and they definitely help, but we're out until the end of this week and would really love a pizza. We live in Georgia, Eastern time zone. The pizza places nearby are Pizza Hut, Little Caesars, and Domino's.  This is my first time using this site, so if I do something I'm not supposed to, I won't be offended, please let me know!
0	Okay , title was a bit dramatic.  But he is really sick.  He's been sniffling ,  dizzy , nauseous  and pathetic for the last couple days (his only days off this week)  His family is in a tough financial situation  (Living on savings for the next 12 months until his mom's out of school and into a new job) so he's been eating jello  , and the chicken noodle soup I dropped off for him.  Can we please get him something solid , delicious and pizza shaped to eat so he can get better and return to work tomorrow!? :(
0	My husband left recently for a 6 week military TDY and I'm stuck here alone in this house this week with no way to get anywhere until I leave to visit my family. Our funds are really short, and I'm starting to feel like a crazy cat lady eating soup all day. My cats Friskies is starting to look good.   Pizza would be amazingly appreciated, it solves hunger AND loneliness =] 
0	I have no sob story here, just jobless right now no food in fridge and hungry,I'd love to pay it forward once I get back on my feet again. would love it if someone could help me out today, sick of bumming off of my friends even though they say they dont mind
0	Can someone make the first night here a bit easier?
1	It's a dreary Sunday here, my mom and dad are off from work today however there's absolutely nothing to eat. We're strapped for cash until the next couple of days when they get a portion of their tax returns. I'd like to surprise them with some cheesy goodness that is pizza! If anyone could help with a pie that would be wonderful!
1	Just trying to make it until payday this Friday. I came up short this week and need some help. Any help would be greatly appreciated! 
0	Hey Pizza People! First of all I just want to thank you guys for being so awesome and making this subreddit possible. Once I have money, I plan to be a random-pizza-giver :3  So backstory. Last year (I was 18), I was sexually assaulted by a stranger not too far from Harvard Square. It resulted in some severe PTSD: I couldn't sleep or eat. I was hardly able to function or focus enough to even engage in casual conversation. I couldn't stand to exist in my own mind any longer so I tried to fix it by drinking, which only made me feel sick and more depressed. I tried smoking weed (I'd smoked often before and it seemed to help then) but now the weed gave me flashbacks to the assault and made it so much worse. I was getting desperate. I don't know how the idea got into my head, but one morning I was getting dressed and I just made the decision. It was this voice of deliberate recklessness that announced, "Today I'm going to try heroin."  It was alarmingly easy to get my hands on it. It was cheap and it was everything I needed. I knew it was stupid, but I didn't care. I had nothing left to lose - and why stop when it works?  Well eventually I ended up in a psych hospital for the PTSD and heroin addiction. I got help, I got my shit together, and I'm going to college.  So yeah. That's my story. This is me [before and after](http://imgur.com/blBMtWH) getting my shit together.  Thanks for reading this, if you did :) otherwise,  **TL;DR: Bad guy, PTSD, heroin, recovery, can I have pizza now please?**
