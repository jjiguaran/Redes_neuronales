0	Unfortunately our funding just ran out, and the university does not plan to renew our grants! We're on the verge of a major breakthrough, wherein we deploy a series of nanobots into the patient's blood stream which seek out and destroy cancer cells! The nanobots run on pizza, but we're out! We're stationed at Western Michigan University! Please, the future of mankind could be in your hands!  [Just to be upfront, we're just really hungry and could use a pizza. But so could our nanobots.]
0	My roommates and I all have finals this week and we are all in between paychecks. We would really love some pizza, we will definitely be paying it back when we have the chance.
0	Not sure how this whole thing works but I do tech support from my house and today is that day of the month (Not a women, in regards to food) were rent is paid but I am with out cash until I get paid. I will return the favor, I promise.
0	College student, just got gainfully employed but don't start until a week from now and won't get paid until end of month. The other job I work has a check in the mail but it'll be close to a week until it gets here, clears the bank, and I can get some food in the apartment. I'm working from a 6 month budget that had a $2000 shortfall. Sad thing is that I'm already one pizza behind in paying it forward. I have a couple wrinkled potatoes, frozen potato stuff, frozen fish, a little frozen fruit, about 10 eggs, some rice, a little bit of frozen peas, one packet of kool-aid and some coffee, and a box of macaroni and I can't eat any more of that stuff without puking - I just can't force any more of it down my throat like I have been the past two weeks. I had my laundry money planned out for this month to the quarter only to find the landlord increased cost per load by 50% without telling anyone so I'm tapped out of cash. I have maybe 20 miles left in the tank to get back and forth to work and then to the bank to cash my paycheck (that's still in the mail and won't arrive until Monday or Tuesday depending on the whims of the mail service).  I know there are people in worse shape but if someone would be so kind as to send one my way? I know it's too late tonight but tomorrow, perhaps?
0	My neighbors upstairs have been playing the same god damn Wiz Khalifa song for the past hour, and show no signs of stopping. I've already tried all the usual stuff like asking my neighbors downstairs if I can sleep in their bed for the night, but they didn't seem so interested once they found out I suffer from debilitating night terrors and vomit inducing bouts of gas.   If I knew how to [make my own pizza](http://cl.jroo.me/z3/R/1/u/d/a.aaa-pizza-man.jpg) I would gladly do that, but my head hurts and if I were to try and make it rain right now, it would be more like a Siberian hail storm of nickels and those Canadian pennies I can't get rid of.  Maybe if I'm lucky, I'll get a [vigilante delivery guy](http://gargles.net/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/DeliveryGuy2.jpg) to come save me.  [Here's hoping](http://fatcatart.ru/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Shepard-Fairey_Hope_cat_HOPE_EN1.jpg)
0	found out today that I could quite possibly be losing my job due to restructuring within the company. dealt with some relationship issues as well that didn't go so hot. snapped at my mom- had no intentions of doing so.   could really use a pizza and coke.
0	I'm broke again, fridge empty. Did not have enough money after bills and such to do any food shopping. I only have my carfare to and from work on a metrocard. I would appreciate a pizza, please and thanks a million. :)
1	[Received]   Big THANKS to katzmcn 
0	A good three months ago, a family welcomed me into their home when I was living on the streets. I was homeless, broke and starving when they saved me. Now, I am on my feet thanks to them and they are moving tomorrow because of a family emergency. Since all of the food is packed up, I would like to get them a pizza but I do not have the money to do this until I get paid next Friday, which will be to late, so I will pay forward. Many thanks
0	Braces are expensive, and I got them very late (18 currently). So I'd love to have something solid I can actually eat while feeling better about myself. Por favor?  
1	I was just hit with an unknown council tax bill for Â£200 which wiped out my months wages. If anybody would be kind enough to get me one i will repay with one at the month.
0	I'm in Cincinnati and my automatic bill pay screwed me over for the rest of the week.  It's really my fault, but I just ran out of cheeze-its.  I have 4 Dota 2 keys if anyone still actually needs them.
1	Alright guys, I don't have some major sob story, my life isn't that bad or anything, I'm just broke until next Thursday when my University issues refund checks to students. My promise to you all, is that if I can get a pizza tonight, I will pay it forward to a lucky individual next week, when I get my loan money from school. Otherwise, I'm making ramen tonight (again). Here is a picture of me with my scooting goggles on, so you know how serious this is. We roll hard down in the southwest.   http://i.imgur.com/q6D4x.jpg
0	Am hungry and would love a pizza, been unemployed for over a year, barely make rent and necessities. Cannot afford a luxury item like pizza, but would love one.
0	so my girlfriend is a waitress and has been sick for the last couple days, we rely on her tips for food and what not. She is feeling better today but is moping around the house because she is worried about well EVERYTHING. I think a pizza fix would cheer her up. what do you think?
0	I'm going to be home the next day and a half. It'd make my weekend if someone had a pizza delivered to me at some random moment. I live around Albany, NY.  Given one, willing to pay forward.
0	Hello fellow redditors things have been tough but I know they will get better eventually. Was wondering if a kind and thoughtful soul could help a family of 5 with a decent meal this Friday evening. Food is almost nil around here and will not be able to buy any until Monday. There are 5 of us. 2 adults, and 3 children if anyone can help. We have a pizza hut that is not too far from the house so an egift card would be perfect. I want to thank you all so much for reading my post.   ((Hugs))
0	It's been too long, I'll take anything! 
0	Doubt any one will do this, but im too broke, and hungry. Check out my gonewild pics. 
1	My fiance and I just spent the last of our money on gas, and we're hungry - willing to do stuff to make people laugh for pizza.   Located near Indianapolis, Indiana  (edited for location)
0	Hey RAOP, we have to white out the walls in our apartment in order to get our security deposit back. We don't have much food or time to cook, and our money is going to rent &amp; utilities. We would love a pizza inbetween coats.  We're in the Western Massachusetts area. Thanks in advance!
1	i live in New Mexico. Life is pretty good. ups and downs, just like everyone else. i just like pizza, and can't get any. no papa john's in my town though.   Edit: Thanks K-Dawgg!!
0	Really craving some pizza would greatly appreciate a yummy one.. and will return a pizza to some one else asap... we just moved and got settled in and I work all week we want to have a family day chilling in our new apartment relaxing.. 
0	Driving from Michigan to Georgia. Thank you so much if someone actually responds to this.
1	Hey RAOP! I am currently unemployed and just graduate from Missouri State with a degree in journalism. Life's been hard recently and I only have 60 bucks to spend over the next 2 1/2 weeks. My food stamps ran out and I cannot get back on the for another 3 weeks.   I would love a pizza, because as of late, I have been eating one package of Ramen a day. I am about to go to the store to get my dog some more food, and probably will only have 45 dollars left after that.   My parents are in a similar situation and really cannot help me. I have never been in such a poor situation my entire life, and some pizza would definitely make my situation a lot more tolerable!   Thanks! 
0	I'm located in TN.  Thanks in advance!  Looking forward to fulfilling some requests on this sub as well.
0	...Okay, we aren't *literally* starving (we have a few things to hold us over), but the only thing we have thawed out is hamburger meat, and we're going to do hamburgers tonight. However, my sister and I would love something to hold us over until then!  My mom's out right now, so a pizza to share between the two of us would be swell. &lt;3 I'm willing to go pick it up too, so you save money on the delivery!  I really don't know how to market this, sorry.  **edit**: plus, pizza just sounds really good. we're from the bay area~
0	Girlfriend is at home, sick and hungry. She has no cash right now and I don't get paid until tomorrow or I'd order her some cheeze pizza. If anyone is able to help it would be much appreciated! Thank you!
0	The other night the alternator belt slipped off the engine and a coolant pipe burst. The power steering gave out and I had a bit of a workout getting the boat home with a steam cloud drifting behind and the emergency blinkers on. Boom! Scary, but everyone's safe. It does mean that my next pay check is tied up.  Today our 9 month old was sleepy nursing and ended up taking a chunk out of /u/mrsslowloris nipple and now she's feeling a little nursing shy and she'd like a pizza tonight. I do have a picture of the bloody nipple with a chunk missing if you need proof. Thanks!
0	My girlfriend and I have been dating for six months today and I was being the guy I am and didn't get a gift. It turns out that she had gotten me a gift and I didn't get her one, even though we agreed on no gifts. So if anyone could help me out, that would be amazing. I promise to pay it forward when I get paid next week.
0	College has taken forever to review my residency form and I can't accept my loans until the "non ohio resident" charge is removed.  I can pay it back (or forward if you prefer) when my residency goes through and I get my refund money.  Been a redditor for 3 years and and have a verification code.
0	So on the 6th it is my birthday. I am posting this now so that more people get to see it, If anyone would send me a pizza on my birthday shoot me a PM and I will be eternally grateful. No sob story or anything. I just enjoy pizza. Thanks.
1	I'm just being 100% honest here. I'm not starving, but due to me losing my job and only having enough money to pay bills for 2 months if I don't buy anything, I haven't had pizza in a very long time. I actually moved here from out of state because the job market is better. I am currently living with my parents, at the age of 32. :(
0	I am recently unemployed and had to move back in with my parents. I'm incredibly appreciative of them allowing me to stay with them but I feel terribly guilty about the financial burden I am putting on their already thinly stretched wallets.   I would be very grateful to anyone who could provide a meal that is not on my parents' dime. I am in the Iowa area and have a verification code and hope to find some way to repay anyone's kindness.
0	After getting what had to be hundreds of "We're sorry" letters (and that's only the places that bothered to reply) I've finally run the gamut of interviews and got an offer!  I've been stretching my pennies quite far throughout this process, but the job is in another part of the country and I need to make sure I have enough scratch to make the trip.    I'd love to be able to celebrate a bit and have some tasty pizza, and I look forward to being able to pay it forward before the end of the month. (I start the 22nd)  I have the big three close to me, and anything would make me so grateful!  Thanks for reading, and good luck to other job-seekers out there - it can seem like it's futile, but just keep at it!
1	My girlfriend and I are moving out of a bad apartment and it has drained us financially. The work I do is going through a dry spell so I have not gotten paid in a month, and any funds I had left in my account have been put towards transferring services and paying first and last on a new place, as well as paying existing bills.  We haven't had much of a meal in around two weeks and our fridge is empty tonight. A pizza would really help and cheer me up! Thanks a lot for your consideration, RAOP.
0	Got roughly $6,000 on 4 cards over the years from touring in various bands, school, medical stuff, and luxury purchases. Currently living in my friends living room and I have 81 cents in my bank account. I've been applying for work like crazy but nothing has come up for me yet. Looking for a repreave from the now nightly Top Ramen dinner.
1	Having a rough couple days up here at sacred heart. No money to eat and the cafeteria charges $2 for a 20 Oz. soft drink. The hospital food is horrible and they only give enough for the patient. A pizza would be absolutely amazing. thank you to all who read/comment. your time is much appreciated. Proof is available.
0	My gf and I had a little bit of a crisis lately (car accident) which used up all of our money. We get paid tomorrow, but we've barely been eating this past week. We would love a hot pizza to tide us over! :)  Location: Virginia, USA (thanks Tarable!)
0	Looking for someone to shout dinner tonight. Wife is 35 weeks pregnant and I'll be home too late to cook. Wanna shout our unborn child some random pizza goodness? I'm in Australia!  Edit: spelling (must be getting hungry!)
0	I just got out of the hospital a few days ago and immediately spent all of my money on a variety of new prescriptions that I needed to start. I'm out of food now and don't get paid until tomorrow. I'm type one diabetic so I'm kind of afraid that if I don't eat anything at all today I'm going to be in rough shape tomorrow. That, and after over a week of hospital food and dry cereal pizza sounds amazing. So if someone would be generous enough to provide me with one, I would appreciate it greatly.
0	Willing to Offer at anothers request when i can afford to. :)
0	It is that time of the month where bills are due and money is gone. I usually go to my parents house to get some food when I'm low and down, but unfortunately they are out of town for some time.   Anyone willing to help out a Redditor in the southeast texas area? 
0	Some friends and I are coming to Memphis, TN in just a few hours.  We're driving up from Little Rock.  Unfortunately, the best man recently got laid off and most of the rest of us are underemployed. Memphis is about the furthest away that we could afford to go.  Don't get me wrong, we are going to give him a fantastic send-off from the single life.  Even if it means being late on bills next month.  But a little pizza kindness would be so amazing and would take some stress off.  The groom is a great guy and he deserves an amazing bachelor party.  We're cramming 9 guys in one room at the Marriott.  Message me if you just have a craving to help make a party a little more awesome.  Thanks for reading.
0	We had to eat some nasty church donuts yesterday but they werent giving any out today.  PM me for details  Edit: maybe i should have mentioned before that my electricity is off and that im not just asking because i happen to be hungry. If you want proof that we dont have food i can upload pictures. And i can even show you the extension cord running from our neighbors house over here.
0	I've been applying to all the fast food restaurants (and other places too!) in my area but no offers so far. We have some food for the next couple days until payday but a pizza would help a lot. I can't offer anything besides my word that when I find a job I'll pizza someone too.   thank you! :)
0	I would like an awesome person to send another awesome person to send me an awesome pizza. Hells yeah
0	Finals are upon me once again and between my lovely empty bank account and a school that puts me on a limited number of swipes a day, pizza sounds amazing.  
0	My best college buddy Lives in New Zealand but has been sleeping on my sofa in Los Angeles for the last 2 months because he has run out of money.  We want to watch the football games this afternoon but I'm tired of paying for him!  I feel like I have a 30 year old child.  Anyone wanna send us some PIZZZZZAZ?!!?!  CAN HAZ?
0	Just moved to Conshohocken apartments in Philly. I have had ramen for the last 4 days and I wont have money for stuff for a few weeks. It would be awesome if someone could pizza-me-up sometime. PM me and I can of course give you any info if you are interested in helping me out!  Peace
0	Howdy all, long time pizza provider here. Some folks at [/r/starcraft](/r/starcraft) put together a king of the hill tournament and stream it every night in different player skill levels.  It gives newer and experienced players a place to have fun and their own 15 minutes of fame. They don't give out prizes really, but winners get a reddit icon. Some users send a T-shirt to people who win more than X games in a row.  Would RAOP be interested in providing a pizza to the winner of a raffle? I want to give everyone who watches and plays a ticket into the raffle and pick a winner for ROAP to offer pizza.  Viewers who tweet @Something will be given one entry. Players who lose are given 2 entries, and winners would be given 3 entries per win.  I'm sorry if I violated any rules of this subreddit. I'm not trying to create some scam, and I don't run the event - it's organically composed - but this is technically still a (statistically) random act of pizza.  **EDIT** DERP they have a  website too http://rcraftgaming.com
0	I've had a horrible week so far and just found out today that I won't be getting my financial aid disbursement till the first week of March. I could really use a pizza to chow down on tonight instead of staring at my pantry deciding on ramen noodles, or ramen noodles to eat.   EDIT: This is just a throwaway I made, I don't want my friends to think they have to help me anymore then they already have. PM me and I can give you my main name if you want to look into my posting history.  Thanks
0	i know there seem to be a lot of broke hungry college students, but i am another one. no groceries, ive been living off of instant oatmeal and ramen, i dont get a paycheck until next week and 100% of it is going to pay off my credit card. cheese or sausage or pepperoni pizza would be awesome!
0	Hey RAoP, I'm a student in Raleigh and unfortunately this month has been hard on my wallet. I spent a large chunk of my money on a gift for my girlfriend's birthday and I spent the whole day driving out to get it. On top of that, my university closed its dining hall early tonight because of the holiday so I'm running off of the small amount of snacks I have in my dorm. I would love for some warm food tonight if anyone is generous enough. 
0	I'd love you guys forever and of course return the favor. 
1	First request, will pay it forward when we're feeling better.
0	PIZZA ME. [](/omg) 
0	Just a little bit. Enough to be seriously craving pizza, and be terrible at CAPTCHA.   I'm in Massachusetts, USA -  watching futurama &amp; dreaming about pizza. 
0	Hey guys, my roommate/partner in rhymes lost his job yesterday and I've been unable to find work for months.  We've no money (at all) for at least another few days and we're down to three potatoes.  These boys are heavily craving some za to break the monotony and lift our spirits a bit. Thanks in advance to anyone wishing to send some good karma our way!
0	Eight Hour shift ends tonight at nine. I have a midterm tomorrow and another eight hour shift after. No food in the house. Any time or money I can save would be great. Not the best sob story but worth a try. Thanks  Phoniemcringring  Edit : Leaving work at nine to take a hr bus ride/walk home. Info about me - Student working at my Univ's library. Pay is ok but the shitty thing is that I get a check once a month. Pay day is not til August 8 and the money I have saved is for rent/groceries. Can't afford eating out and  all the stores (that have food) will be closed by the time I get home. ( I live in the "cuts" (working class, , lower economic ladder neighborhood; suburban "firstworldproblem" type people might call it a "ghetto" or a "hood" but to me it's great place with cheap rent with great neighbors but a poor ratio of liquor stores to supermarkets or corner stores will actual food)   EDIT : Thanks to everyone who upvoted this. I have received information regarding an ecard to use to get pizza. THANK YOU REDDIT FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN!
0	Hi Reddit, I don't really like asking for help but my daughter and I just moved into our apartment a week ago and we are going through a bit of a rough patch [financially](http://i.imgur.com/9IH4v.jpg). At the moment we have [no food](http://imgur.com/a/UCUvL#0) except some condiments. My daughter is extremely hungry and words can not describe how low I feel about not being able to feed her. I really thought I planned things out well but I did not. And now she has to suffer for my screw up.  As I stated [I have Paypal cash](http://imgur.com/2AO2c), but I do not have a paypal debit card, If someone would want to do a trade I'd appreciate it. If anyone can help but does not have a Paypal I can send you a [$25 Bath and body works GC](http://imgur.com/a/UCUvL#0). It is my fault that I did not plan things correctly, and this is my last option for today to make things right for my daughter. I am not in any way shape or form asking for a handout or a freebie, I just want to make a simple trade so my daughter and I can eat tonight. I'm not posting on my real account because I'm ashamed that things turned out this way and I feel I should only be here to help and not to be helped. But I can do a trade and pay it forward to make it up. If you want any more proof please don't hesitate to ask, I can give my account name and more picture, even a picture of my state ID. 
0	I wanna do something special for him to cheer him up, but have no money to my name. The best way to cheer him up has always been a quiet night in with movies, board games, and some delivery. I'm unemployed and going to school full-time, so all my money has gone to bills. We also only have some quinoa, eggs, and celery for today's food. I can't drive, and he's so sick he doesn't wanna leave the house to pick more food up. I'd like to let him stay in for the day while still having yummy food to cheer him up!  I will absolutely pay it forward (or request whatever you like from me!) as soon as it's a financial possibility for me!  Also, not sure if it's important (never requested before, sorry if I messed this up) but Dominos is the only chain that will deliver to us.  Thanks! :)
0	Im 27 and still living with my mom. I stay with her to help her through her pain and her work, she doesn't really have anyone else so I feel obligated to be here for now. My paycheck alone is going entirely to bills, medication, gas(which is killing me), other.. The one good thing is that the little money I do manage to save is going to my community college, so I am getting an education with the free time i have.. Regardless of all of that, there is nothing in my house to eat right now, and I am starving. Could you please help? It would mean the world to me and my mother right now, and it would definitely take care of 1 problem for tonight.  edit: General location- Rowlett, Texas
0	Pizza craving overload. I will be able to pizza if forward on the Friday after next.. but until then, I'll send you 1 drawing for 3-5 days of whatever you so decide. I'm not an art student, but I would like to offer something awesome for something awesome. 
0	Really nothing more to say. Been inside all day studying and all of us are hungry.
0	Hello, I had a friend direct me to this when he couldn't help me with any cash. I'm basically awaiting on my financial aid that hasn't came in yet. My bank account has been in the red for 3 weeks now and I've been eating water with Bisquick pancake mix. I'm just trying to get by until middle of next week with my Aid will come in, though I can tell my unhealthy diet hasn't been the best. I don't know how this subreddit works but any pizza would make me so happy. I will gladly return the favor when my aid gets in. My parents or friends can't afford to get my back account black again so it's a shitty situation.  I'm from Grand Forks, ND btw!  
0	time for giving but gave to much now im broke myself: I recently had bought toys to give away at toys for tots anad it comes down to it i spent over 100 dollars i had left anticipating of getting paid today and guess w hat happens, I go in and lose my job becuase of labor cuts. PLEASE help me feed my siblings tonight sincelry your dear redditor  PS will send pic with pizza and siblings
0	My mom only has 20 dollars left until next week which she is going to use for gas to get to work. My dad is 3 weeks late on child support. All my fam has been eating is toast or soup. Some pizza would be nice. thank you.
0	Just got done paying this months bill, rent, and utilities. Won't have any cash coming in for a little more than a week. A pizza would definitely keep me alive for a good part of that. Would happily provide college proof if necessary
0	I've never done this before, and I can't imagine anybody would give a stranger a free pizza. But why not give it a shot.   I just want a night of greasy comfort food. Like I said, being sued for 50k, due to a bus accident I caused a year ago in which 14 people were injured (an honest mistake; it was raining, couldn't get out of the way in time, just spun in place). Insurance couldn't cover it all. Had to empty my bank account to pay for a lawyer, and on top of that I got laid off from my job a few months ago. Living with my parents again, and was almost able to move back out, until the accident. Back to square one.  I've always had problems with anxiety and depression, and this is really making me crumble. Had to stop seeing my therapist due to losing my insurance through my job (called some sliding scale clinics but not taking new patients). It would just be nice to eat some comforting pizza. But I can't afford much.   Thanks for your consideration and for reading this. If you want proof of some kind I'll provide whatever you need; I know it sounds like kind of a fantastic run of bad luck.
0	Hey guys,  I've made my way in to uni at 8:30pm to work on assignments and get ahead in general. I came straight from a netball game to here, so haven't eaten a thing since lunch.  To explain the title, I am absolutely and completely broke in terms of both spirit and cash. The year started off with my girlfriend of 4 years breaking up with me and having to move out, which sunk me into a state of depression.  I was working full time, but had plans in place to go back to uni and leave my job. My annual leave payout was going to cover my credit card debts, and I was to rely on welfare + a part time job to cover rent, bills, petrol, etc. The annual leave payout was a lot less than I anticipated, as I was taxed a lot, meaning I could only pay off one credit card, and the rest paid my rent in advance for a couple of weeks to make sure there were no issues there. Centerlink have screwed me around, and have told me I may potentially be waiting six months before they start paying me. I've been looking, but struggling, to find part time work. I made $100 last week for fixing a family members computer, and I put in about 15 hours of work to earn that money, but haven't seen any more since.   My car rego is now overdue, I have two months of unpaid phone bills that need to be paid, when I run out of petrol (I have about half a tank at the moment) I have no idea how I'm going to get to and from uni, and I have absolutely no idea where the money for my car payment and insurance is going to come from on Friday. Not to mention the required payments for my other two credit cards, which I'm now starting to get payment reminders for.  The reason I'm struggling with uni is that because of the depression, I'm also suffering from anxiety, and it has been a real struggle to get myself to uni. I've been stressing about where the money is going to come from to cover all my bills, and what I'm going to do when I need to start making rent payments again. Not to mention being out dealing with centerlink and desperately looking for work.  Please help a fellow redditor in need out and sort me out with a pizza to help me get through the night. When a source of income comes in, I am more than happy to return the favour. When I do have money, I try to regularly made it a habit to help people out. I'm also happy to fulfil requests, but bear in mind that I'm at uni.  Thanks in advance =) 
0	Spokane Washington is lustful for a wonderful pizza, I don't care about about the size, gender, or ethnic origin of this pizza, so long as it has sauce. No payday till friday, and man, I'm freaking salivating right now looking at all these stupid pizza ads I get in the mail...
0	I've nothing I can sell, not even my own blood because apparently you can't do that if you have a fever. If anyone can help with a pizza, I can only promise to pay it forward when my life is less messy! Thank you so much in advance. I'm not sure how this works so pm me I guess? 
0	Hey all, I'm a bit down in the dumps tonight. I'm hanging out at home, and since I just paid my rent, I am totally broke. It's either this or Ramen -_- Anyone want to help my Saturday night look less bleak? :) 
1	So i've been surviving off bread and soup for a few days and have a few more days of that to look forward to. I don't get off work for a few hours though and all my soup is at home. I only have 3 cans left, so I'm hesitant to even eat them.   Would anyone be able to hook up a pizza? Any pizza? I had some M&amp;M's today but even making this request is making me salivate.  Update: In another thread Krayer saw and sent me $7.92 so imma go buy some tuna and cup of noodles. Thank you to anyone who read this post but tonight, I dine on canned fish!  Edit 2: 1369ic hooked it up a lil more so when possible i shall post a picture of my tuna, bread, and other good eats in place of pizza tonight. 
0	Hey r/randomactsofpizza, its my birthday, and all i have is cold turkey that probably is bad. Please only consider this if you do noy have to go out of your way moneywise. Thank you for even reading this, and happy holidays! Edit:For clarification, 559 is central california. Agriculture everywhere.
0	Hey Reddit. This is my call in hope to get something warm to eat today. This morning I locked myself out of my flat. It is really cold here and my flatmate will come home in at least 7 hours... when he arrives, all the shops here will be closed so my plan of buying dinner just disappeared. I went to my university so at least i will not freeze to death. Maybe someone of you can make my day a little bit better.
0	I'm broke hungry spent all my money on rent and power.and don get paid till Monday will pay it forward monday
1	My foodstamps come in on the 8th and I have 13 dollars of it left. It would be nice to have some piece of mind for a night. I don't really want to broadcast my life and what is going on but if you would like to know for some legitimacy I can tell you. I just need some cheering up and have someone nice to come along to keep my faith up.  -Edit- I'm in Lakewood/Denver CO area
0	I got grounded a few days ago and my dad wont give me my allowance so sadly I can not buy myself some pizza. 
1	I have been dreaming of pizza all day. Unfortunately my sister needed some cash today, which I lent to her, forgetting don't have work tonight and can't go in to earn tips to get through the day. I am not clever or particularly talented and cannot offer anything original in exchange for pizza.  What I CAN offer is a beautiful pair of shoes, your choice! I'm a member of justfab.com, it's an online shopping site, and I have a bunch of reward points wracked up. If you'd like, you can visit their website, pick out a pair that catches your eye, and I'll have it shipped to you! In exchange for pizza!  Sweet deal!
0	so, my brother and his g/f just moved out of our apartment a couple weeks ago, and it's been great having the place to myself until i can get a new roommate... unfortunately, it's left me also having to pay rent and bills entirely on my own.. which, as of this week, has left me with $2 in my bank account, no more food in my fridge, and a really big appetite, since i've had (literally) nothing but ramen for the last two days.  i would really appreciate any help, and if this works out, when i get paid on Thursday, i'll make an [Offer] thread to try and pay it forward.  thanks in advance!!
0	Hi I know I am new here but I had to try and at least ask. I've been on reddit for only a couple days and I first asked on [/r/loans](/r/loans) for a small loan for gas money so I can start my new job but I am too new so there has been no offers. Well I think I lost my chance at this new job. I will find out tomarrow.  (I'm telling you all this so you know why I posted there for a loan and now here for pizza. We currently have $0.36 to our name. My husband asked for overtime at his job so he has to work 12 hrs tonight. I have no food to make him for lunch and he has to eat with working so many hours. If anyone can help I will pay back with interest plus I will buy another fellow member a pizza on 12/22(Thursday). I don't care about eating myself I just really would like to get my hubby something as starving and working a physically damanding job is torture. (he does metal finishing like chrome plating). So please if you can help me feed my hubby you would be my personal pizza angel:) I will be forever indebt to you!! If you can't I still would like to thank you for at least reading my post:)
0	Hello, my name is Lauren I'm a 21 year old pregnant college student studying for her finals in psychology. I was not fortunate enough to have parents who can help me financially. Anyone who lives in New York knows that monthly metro cards are $104. My paycheck went to that and my cell phone bill. If there is anyone who can help me by purchasing a pizza so I can have some fuel to study for my exams. I attend school in manhattan New York
0	No sob story here, just a hungry guy after work. I've got a pretty big craving for some pizza but trying to save cash for when I head up to school again in the fall. Any of you guys want to help a dude out?  C:
0	what else can I say? i'm a poor college student. I should have known it was coming, he's been very distant for the last week.  I'm located in PA, if anyone out there has a kind heart.......
0	Hello~    I am a broke college student and I am currently craving some pizza!  It would be awesome to eat tonight without putting myself even further into debt with my student loans.  Also, pizza is delicious!  I would be glad to repay you by way of silly pictures or chiptunes.     Thanks for reading my post~   
1	My birthdays coming up here and well, I've got absolutely nothing going on. Everyone parties on my day while I stay at home and watch the ball drop. I know how odd it is to ask for a present but hey let's try it, a present of pizza!  Here's some [proof](http://imgur.com/VnXUH) that New Years is indeed my birthday. Really haven't a way to show my sad party... Just picture a person, in front of a computer and my cat wearing a birthday hat!  Edit: got pizza'd and had a fun time... even Que had  a bite :) Thanks morzinbo! 
0	...and I think the title pretty much says everything I can say about my sad and sad life. Haven't even left the house today. 
0	There's a Domino's very close to where he lives, and I just wanted to brighten his day with a nice pizza! :D Thanks!
0	buddy turned 26 last night. drank far to much because someone else was buying. did far too much drunk texting. and just to add to it. the bar tender did not know how to make a old fashioned and did not have cherrys. i crashed on his floor in his kitchen. and i am broke and in between jobs.  i am in portland oregon and have never asked for a pizza before figured i would try it out 
1	We have a pizza hut, dominos, papa johns, basically all the big chains here. I'm just looking for a quick meal for the lil one and myself. 2 topping, medium would probably be plenty for us. (and garlic butter. mmmm butter.) I don't know if anybody has deals with breadsticks but we could take em or leave em. :-)  I've requested and had it filled once, and pizza'd it forward. I will try to do so again come payday. If not this next one, ONE VERY SOON!   Thanks for reading!!!
0	I don't get paid until Wednesday, and my sister and I are reeling from the fact that we just found out our biological father lost his fight with cancer this morning. A pizza or 2 would be a welcome. Have a good week.  EDIT: forgot to put [request] in the title the first time. Maybe that's why it didn't show up on the subreddit...
1	It feels weird and kind of crappy to ask for help over the internet but I'm broke and tired of eating white rice. Its all I have for food until I get paid next Thursday. A pizza sounds delicious right about now.  I live alone and my summer job is winding down. I tried to save money knowing this transitional time between my summer/winter jobs was coming but its just one thing after another, leaving me where I am now - eating rice and nearly broke (if $1.50 in quarters counts as having money). This week and the next are probably the worst I'm going to have it. I just want something hot to eat that isn't rice.  Can provide pics of my kitchen as proof, even my paperwork for a food stamp application if it helps.  Happy holidays everyone  Edit: [Pizza came](http://i.imgur.com/SC3RC.jpg). Wish I could put into words how grateful I am and how unexpected it was to see not 1, but 4 pizzas come..this will last me a while. Thank you. I'm not even sure what else to say besides thank you a hundred times. This is the nicest thing anyone has done for me in quite some time.
1	Pizza could mean a meal for my sister her family  My sister recently has had a string of bad happenings, Both of our grandmothers just died and her Car broke down on the way to the funerals (~500mi)... Its been very tough and we recently went over her financial standing and she averages -120 a month (more if you include her hospital bill that she dosn't pay)-- but Money aside what she needs most is food especially for her daughter(12) and step daughter(17). Thats what she really cares about..  She recently gained full custody of her daughter, the father sat in jail for the first 9 years of his daughter's life.. then upon regaining his freedom sought to take her away to montana, over 2,000 miles away. An ex-con with a new lawyer girlfriend and a seedy past of child abuse with his other offspring.. luckily she won that- but with that came a nice sized loan for her own lawyer  She's been denied by assistance and by the local food bank- she make JUST over the line for too much  Canned Goods, Cereal, Lunch items for school or anything else  I, her younger sister, am a designer (the starving artist) I gave her what i could of my savings to keep her in her apartment, but now i'm reaching out to the Web- She has pizza hut and papa johns by her home or  I can trade work for pizza/favors  Thank you for your time  -R  TLDR: Sister is desperately behind and needs help, especially with food for her 2 daughters
0	typical hungry college student stuck at home without money. I just got a job but I probably won't get paid until another week. I will pay you back or pay a pizza forward if you wish!
0	I got a good 40 miles in during the 4-5 hours of sunshine on Friday, but the steady on/off of rain around the state has kept me out of the saddle the rest of the week. I haven't had a delivery pizza in over a month after getting serious about my diet, but I've been drooling thinking about crispy pepperonis and stringy cheese lately. I could use a cheat day, would anybody like to help quell these cravings? 
0	In Fargo, ND if it matters
0	its not like I havent been trying, I have. mid summer is just the worst time in the world to apply for jobs. well that and after christmas so ive been told. I sent my resume out to different workpaces and have heard back from a few of them, i'd just like to keep my money in case things dont work out and im forced to wait a little while longer.
0	Starving due to unexpected expense. Have been for a little over a wk now and would love a pizza to carry me over to payday. Will gladly return the favor when payday comes. Willing to do almost any task(nothing to hurt myself or others) Thank you so much in advance!!
0	me my mom and sister with 3 dogs and we got nothing to eat. even the dogs are out and we been feeding them our food the past couple of days so they wont go hungry. now we have nothing to eat and nothing to find in the cabinets to make anything. we would love to have something good to eat. 
0	I am 23 years old and bought a house 6 days after my 21st birthday. My bills are $1823.61, I make $1800 a month. That is my basic utilities and a cell phone. I have no internet or cable.   I am a vegetarian and eat no meat (or fish).   Anyone that could help I would appreciate it.
1	I'm a college grad living in NYC. Interning to keep my feet in the business, freelancing and dog walking when I'm not interning. The money I made this month is just enough to keep a roof over my head and my heat kept on.  I have no food, having eaten down what's left of my pantry over the course of the month. I've had nothing to eat but condiments for the last two days. I woke up this morning with a splitting headache and cramps in my feet. Anything you could give is appreciated! If this doesn't work, I'm going to try begging for food (not money) on the train.  I really don't want it to come to that...  **EDIT:** Thank you so much to @SallyMacLennane for gifting me with food today.  It was amazing and I will have left overs to last me through the weekend!  THANK YOU to everyone who upvoted and @m2mu for the soup kitchen advice!  Many best wishes this Thanksgiving!!
0	I just recently relocated here from Texas to work on Master's degree at Fairmont State University and since I have to live in the dormitories here for the summer I was forced to also buy the meal plan for the summer.  It is sadly closed Friday-Sunday, and this week will be closed for Memorial day.  My brother (Fapocalypse_Now) suggested I check this out.  Thanks.
0	For the life of me, I can't remember my user name once again. I thought it was coltboy to begin with?! Last time I was in here I gave away a couple of pizzas. Now things have taken a turn for the worse with someone in my family having cancer, the bills associated with that, and I have committed to working on my second degree so I'm in college for another round. I'd just love to have some real food if you can help a hardworking, responsible guy out.  OH MAN Nevermind! Whew! I just checked my Papa John's rewards and I have enough for a free pizza! How did that happen?! I swear I thought I only had 10 points! How did I get 20 more points when I haven't ordered pizza in ages?! Looks like I'm good for the moment, folks!
0	Just moved to London on my own, first time away from home. Have just finished my degree but don't start work until the beginning of October, so won't be paid until November! I have enough money to cover the bills and basic food, but would kill for a nice pizza tonight. Many thanks!
0	So i woke up this morning to an Email saying that my Netflix account (Which I was under the impression was cancelled) charged to my bank account which only had $0.45 in it at the time.   Tried calling the bank to settle this matter, but according to them since I had them help me with this before (one that happened because THEY charged me monthly maintenance fees that had never happened before) I was not eligible for them to waive my overdraft fee of $30. So now my account is -$40.16. Luckily I convinced them to stop, and my parents were nice enough to cover the fees for now.  tl;dr- my day has been a non stop shit show, and a pizza would bring tears of joy to my eyes. I will supply pics of tears of joy if needed.
0	I use food stamps, and we ran out of them this month because of Christmas dinner. My fiance gets paid tomorrow, but tonight we don't have anything to eat. I have three small children too. One pizza would probably be enough, We would really appreciate it. Thank you and God bless.
0	Just got my first job out of college and it's actually out of the country (Brazil). It actually starts in October so still a bit of time to wait. Just need to get the specific type of Visa required etc. Anyway I want to celebrate but lack the funds. A pizza would be great! In the DC Area.  Edit: Got the pizza, thanks quiethero!
0	**Note:** I did post this in the other random act of pizza subreddit first not realizing this was the main one. I have not recieved pizza (or even a comment) there.   Hey, thanks for taking the time to read this. I got injured really badly last pay period and was unable to work for nearly two weeks. Normally I would have a back up plan but I just spent a whole bunch of money on a move out of state so that I could finally get my life heading the direction I needed. I have 7 dollars in my checking account and nothing in my savings. I have a six pack of ramen noodles and half an onion and that is every thing that I own as far as food. I have already been surviving off ramen and toast for the last 3 days. Please help me out. I promise to pay it forward as soon as I am able. I can try and draw you something but my art skills are pretty lacking. I cant think of anything else to barter with if you think of something let me know. Again, thank you for taking the time to read this.  **Edit:** Crap! I realized I didnt add where I am from WA, USA
0	Well, I finished up college and I'm back home now, unemployed, and the whole house is going through a really rough time. Little to no food, hard to pay bills, hardly even any toilet paper. I've never been one to ask for things really, and I don't even want to now, but it's gotten to the point where it's sort've needed. I'm headed to the food bank at a local church in hopes of getting some food, but I just figured this would be worth a shot.       I don't really expect anything, but it'd be awesome if something did happen.       I don't particularly have any skills... or else I'd draw some pictures or some shit. But I do have $5 on my Steam Account, so if someone would like, I'll gift them a game? Idk. 
1	Hey RAP, I just recently moved from my hometown near Seattle (had to get away from some toxic people) and am having a real tough time of it.  I don't like asking for handouts but I don't know how I can eat anymore ramen noodles.  Any help for someone who had to take out a payday loan just to make rent this month would be amazingly appreciated.  Thanks.
0	Hi guys, If you are like me then pizza is more to you then just a good food, it reminds you of a time when life was different, when you would hang out with all your friends when that new n64 game or playstation game came out and stay up all night playing it(conquersmplayer) . Before a time when you had to deal with constant rejection from employers, money problems, rent and bills. If there was ever a time in my life when a pizza would mean alot, that time is now. Also me and my roommate have been eating white rice exclusively for the past two months. Well thats how i see it sorry for long post just wanted to say how i feel, thanks guys!
0	Just two guys near the Seattle Center needing a pie to get us through Tomb Raider II.
0	Hey there, I live in Toronto in a house of starving artists. All I've eaten today is oatmeal and I'd love a couple slices of actual food. I wouldn't have words for how much I would appreciate this. Thank youu Maybe I can trade for art ? I dunno 
0	It seems i got two tickets from toll violations and now i have to pay $285.40 each ticket before the 11/27 or my license will get suspended, i am a broke college student and i am not really sure how i am gonna pay this, could use a pick me up pizza for lunch, thanks a lot....
0	Title basically explains it. I've just moved into a nice, new house but due to having to pay rent twice this month, plus putting down the deposit, I'm completely broke until Friday. If anyone could toss a pie my way, It would be amazing. 
0	Hey all! Pay Day is a few days away, and I've suddenly got a hankering for pizza. If anyone is willing to help I would be eternally greatful!
0	My car broke down and so I lost my job. The car was required for the job. My ex-employer is fighting my unemployment claim. It seems like they want to punish me for leaving them at a busy time so no help there.  I  My dog and I will have to move into my friend's shed at the end of the month. my dog is like my child and my last dollar went to feeding him. I'm very depressed. I spend 70-80 hours a week looking for work to no avail since I have no car any more. It would be angelic if someone could lift my spirits with a pizza.  I have verification if I'm fortunate enough to get a little help. Thank you and I hope everyone has a great day.- Jason
0	My pantry currently contains cereal and canned cream corn. I haven't tried combining the two, but I may have to if this doesn't pan out. I would be forever grateful and willing to pay it forward as soon as my income tax cheque comes in.
0	My pay doesn't come in til tomorrow...no I take that back, tomorrow is Saturday, my deposits don't show up on Saturdays...so gotta wait til Mon.     But it's just me and the dogs roaming around in my yard and watering the garden til midnight when wifey gets home.
0	Just looking for something to help out the parents, everyone's been stressed and there's not much money to go around for food at the moment. I will be able to pay it back in full on Tuesday with a little extra if needed/wanted.  EDIT: If anything does come through before these places close I'd be using http://www.just-eat.co.uk/ if it's of any relevance.   EDIT 2: Thanks for the upvotes guys but unfortunately it's time for me to sleep soon and it's getting closer to closing hours for places near me. Thanks and maybe I'll have better luck in another time of pizza need. :)
0	I have a bunch of 11"x17" poster prints and high resolution jpg's of cool art to trade for a pizza! All pieces were originally painted by me! I have no cash on me and dont get paid till tomorrow. I'll give samples to an offerer. 
0	I hate these damn noddles! I think I'm going to dry up like when you put salt on a snail. Any pie can be helpful, I've been eating them for about 3 weeks already and I'm annoyed with life.
1	I'm a student who just finished with finals, so I can't complain I need brain food or anything, but honestly the paycheck I received most recently was from Thanksgiving week, and I got paid about $140 less than I usually make. Because of this, almost all of it went to Christmas presents.  I tried to buy a bag of chips the other day and my card was declined. I have overdue bills, an empty stomach, and no way to fix either. I don't get paid until Thursday, which is approaching quickly, but not quickly enough. Please help a hungry Redditor out tonight with a pizza, I would be forever in your debt if you did
0	was walking to the store  and saw this beautiful cat  and i couldn't just leave it there .He look so hungry  so i took him  in .I named him Gabriel  i stood up all night trying to bathe him and  spend the last of money  i had to go out just for him i brought him food , scratching post and a bed and toys.   ny,ny 
0	I'm a student preparing for the last few weeks before I graduate, and would greatly appreciate a pizza to reduce some stress
0	Making it month to month on Government Disability (proof upon request) and any help is greatly appreciated! God Bless!
0	They are asking for pizza and I am hoping someone can help them get one tonight. thanks for viewing. Oh Im in MI
1	Me, my girlfriend and our 4 month old son just moved into our house a few weeks ago. With moving expenses and bill deposits we are so broke that we can't buy food for this week. I'm not a big guy, 6'1 170lbs, but I eat like a horse and this week I have only ate one PBJ sandwich a day and my girlfriend has only had one thing of noodles per day if that. My son stays well fed, we make sure of that. So I'm only asking for a pizza today, so that maybe we can fill our stomachs for the next few days. In a few weeks when our situation gets better, I will pass on the kindness.  [here are pictures of us. one of my son, recently, one of me and my girlfriend, and a family picture that is rather old.](http://imgur.com/a/G7GeJ)  thank you to anyone who is willing to help. even if i receive nothing, i think it is amazing that redditors are so helpful with strangers. i fucking love reddit!  edit: I live in Peru, IN. Specifically on the Grissom Air Reserve Base.
0	It took a lot of courage to make this post, and it's very had for me being a husband and Dad to ask this, but my kids would enjoy it. This will be my first ever Christmas away from my family in 17 years of being married. I took a job out of town because the economy is so bad where we live. I send home what I can for family. I rent a room so what I send my family is enough to pay the bills. It leaves no room for luxuries like pizza. my family would love a special treat and I would so appreciate it if someone can provide them with a pizza. I am in Atlanta, GA. They are in Southern FL.   EDIT: I am actually in Kennesaw, GA. which is a suburb of Atlanta. and My family is in Homestead, FL. 
1	My fiancee and I are waiting for our paydays in a few days (woohoo, her first one in a while!) and we're both working tomorrow. As money is kinda short right now, we'd love it if someone would treat us to pizza tonight so we could go to work tomorrow with memories of delicious, delicious noms. And, we'll be more than happy to reciprocate!
0	Hi there, this is my first post on reddit, long time lurker, always checked out RaoP for some inspiration about good people doing good things. I'm not starving, I have some decent food in the fridge, but I would really love some pizza. Pizza is my #1 favorite food, and I usually order some as comfort food. I'm just completely out of money till next friday.  First, I get an email this morning from my step mom that our little dog has kidney disease which is why shes been sick a lot lately. Vet gave her a shot of something to see if she could keep food down, but it didn't work, so shes going to be put down. Then I get home today and boot up my new laptop, its wonderful I saved for 6 months to pay for it, I can play every game that's out on ultra settings and have great FPS. After about 20 mins of playing some Skyrim it just shuts off, won't turn on. Hours of tech support online/calling ASUS, I find i have to send it in for repairs/replacement and won't get it back for up to 2-3 weeks. On my old computer now reading reddit and feeling bad. Shitty day. So if anyone would like to send me a pick me up, I would love you forever.
0	So I'm new to this website and not really sure what it's about. I heard through a friend though that you guys helped him out by giving him a free pizza when he was in need so I'm here today to see if you could do the same for my roommates and I. The three of us moved into our first apartment today so none of us have a job at the moment and my financial aid won't be in until next week sometime! We are in need plz help! XD
1	WARNING: TL;DR   Hey, so after 4 years of knowing this person, I've finally asked out the woman of my dreams to a date this Tuesday, and I'm STOKED! Problem is...I am broke. I'm only in 10th grade and my parents aren't big on lending me money. That's a big downer. However a good buddy of mine has been a Redditor for some years now, and he said that what I should do is come here for random acts of pizza. Normally, being the internet, I'm unsure how this works or if the internet is a kind-hearted place or not. So...going on my friends word.. Can you guys help me with this date? I don't wanna lose her after the first date. Thanks Reddit!  [TL;DR] I have a first date with a 4 year crush in a few days and my friend reccomended me to ask here for the most romantic pizza dinner by Reddit.
1	I don't really have a sob story. My little brother is coming up to my apartment for a few days, and I don't have the money to get a lot of food for us to have an all out bash, so it would be nice to have a little slice!
1	Hello.  I've been subsisting on tip money for the past couple of days, but I had to quit my job this morning because my manager threatened to fire me if I did not take an 18 hour shift (right after 4 hours of sleep from a 12 hour shift!). I had been working as a cook for a sports bar type place for a week and a half, but I have yet to receive my first paycheck. I quit because I cannot work for a place that does not respect the schedule, forcing me to work unannounced overtime that is often more than the scheduled time itself. I've already filled out applications to 5 places, so I am sure I'll be fine. I'll get my paycheck in the mail on Friday or Saturday, too.  About me: 19, EMS student &amp; highschool grad who no longer has tip money to carry him day to day. I moved back in with my mom from my grandparents house. My grandparents are well-off, but my mother is unemployed and gets food bill from the grandparents. She is visiting my aunt and uncle in Canada this week, so no food bill for me until Sunday. :(  What I can give in return: If I give you my Papa John's credentials, you can order just a $10 pizza to my door and I will have earned 1 free large pizza from their loyalty program. :D I can either eat it myself or send it back to you! 2 for the price of 1! I can also chat with you about science, academics, or just politics or really whatever you'd like to talk about. We can connect on Tumblr or Facebook if you like :3
0	So, I deposited my paycheck after my bank's cutoff on Friday and my balance is negative until the check clears on Monday. If someone could shoot me a pizza, I would be happy to shoot a pizza back tomorrow. Consider it a pizza loan? Anyway, I haven't ate since Friday evening and I am absolutely starving. 
0	I don't like asking people for things, but we're going through a rough couple of months, since my boyfriend is a software contract worker and had to take some time off before starting work again (tomorrow actually is his first day back at Microsoft! Hooray!) BUT, that means we're completely out of money until I get paid on Tuesday, and we would seriously love some pizza.    I promise to pay it forward on Tuesday and buy someone else in need a pizza. I feel horrible for asking, but we don't really have any other options. We live in the Seattle area, if that helps. Thank you so much in advance.
0	I'm a disabled single mom &amp; my only son's birthday is this week.  Our house was vandalized last week &amp; w/ the power on, theives took all the wiring while we were away!  Neighbors called the police &amp; the thieves also took all of our appliances!  Anyway, my son's favorite thing to eat is pizzia!  They stole all his electronics &amp; games etc. &amp; I hope this will cheer him up!  God bless one &amp; all who donate to this awesome site! We are w/ friends in central FL now.
1	Just feel like something I don't have to make myself! Never requested before, but been watching this place for a long time. I want to pay it forward in the future.  Edit: I thought, "Man, I don't have anything to exchange." But I do! I will happily draw you anything you request. 
0	Hello everyone! I found out about this website from a friend who heard of it thru WUAH! Im hoping I could get some help tonight for pizza for my family. I am broke until tomorrows payday thanks to a flat tire that i HAD to replace. We dont have much food left in the house and I was going ot buy something just for tonight but now I cant. I feel bad giving my boys pb&amp;j again tonight. We have a local dominos. They are running 2 specials that I know of ( i looked it up lol) where u can get 2 or more mediums for 5.99/each...we would need at least 3 since the boys are bottomless pits and eat alot...i honestly dont know where they put it since they all are tall and so skinny!! Any help would be awesome! thank you for reading!! Oh and I did that verification thing and have a code!
0	It's been a long week, haven't had money, somehow made my food last the week. But I've run out until tomorrow. Anybody wanna spot me a pizza, and I can pay it back some time after tonight?
0	So yesterday I had a really rubbish day - feeling poorly, clients being awful and generally things not going too well. I got home to find my car with a parking ticket because the council put the wrong license plate number on my permit which I hadn't noticed (and I'm a learner so I couldn't move the car), then today I got hit with a load of bank charges for stuff from August, when I was already worrying how I would get through to payday this month because of a bunch of unexpected payments. I have enough in my account for my phone bill, and maybe enough food in cupboard/freezer to manage my meals til payday. I am feeling pretty crap and I'm stuck at work wishing I was under my duvet. Does anyone feel like making my day and gifting me a pizza before I commit to three weeks of beans on toast?  I'll be in a better situation after payday I promise to either repay anyone who would be kind enough to help, or gift someone next month.   Thanks for reading! 
1	**EDIT**: [flamingcow](http://www.reddit.com/user/flamingcow) has graciously offered a gift card, so please consider this **Request filled** and see the other requests in the queue. Thanks flamingcow!  First off - I will **not** *starve* between now and Friday, so if you'd rather help someone who has absolutely nothing, I understand, appreciate your stance, and thank you for helping someone truly in need.    I've been unemployed for better than two years. During that time, I watched most of my photography clients (I did a lot of corporate work) shut down their budgets for expenditures like me. As that income dwindled, I began looking for other work. I'm not sure how much the year-long gap of "employment" (other than self-employed) has mattered, but I haven't been able to find anything. About a week and a half ago I finally got to the point I had to take a laborer job that's physically killing me (ok, it's only very painful). So I'll have something coming my way soon.    In the mean time, I have a 1/2 sack of potatoes, a few cans of corn, 1/2 jar of peanut butter, 3/4 loaf of bread, and a few boxes of mac and cheese. All of which is pretty much what I've been eating for the past couple of weeks. Like I said, I won't starve, but I damn sure don't have a meal I'm actually looking forward to for the next week.    It's just me. My dog passed the day after Easter, and as much as I'd love another pet, I know I'm not in a position financially to take on another right now. So even a medium pizza would be like 4 meals - I could take a couple of slices to work every other day for lunch or something just to break the monotony of what I've been having.    I'm not hiding behind a new account - I am who I am. A quick look at my profile will tell you exactly who I am, and hopefully give you a sense that I try to contribute to the community as well when I can (/r/TOMT, /r/picrequest, gift exchanges, postcards to kids/random people/etc., general blathering). You'll also see where I've sold some of my camera gear to a fellow redditor because I needed the money. I feel bad asking when it's not a matter of "need it or I'll die", but I figure if I'm just honest about where I am, someone might throw me a ~~bone~~ pizza in the spirit of the *Random Acts* part of the subreddit.    Either way, if you're still reading, you're a good person for even considering helping someone out. Thanks for being part of what makes reddit awesome.
0	Hey, RAOP! I'm having a rather crappy day. Last night I stayed at my boyfriends apartment, and at 1:15 in the morning, they towed my car because I parked in his assigned parking spot. After driving to the ghetto, arguing with both the towing people and his landlord, I still had to pay $193.30 in towing fees. Now I'm broke, bummed, and I just want to spend the rest of the day watching Bridesmaids and Mean Girls and gorging on some pizza. It be awesome if someone could help me out today, I'll pay it forward one day! Peace out!
0	Hey guys I've been completely  for months as my wife had to stop working due to ill health (thankfully she is on the mend and returns to work in the new year). I would really appreciate if someone could pizza me so I can remember that sweet taste again. I will either return the favour or if the gifter prefers pizza someone else when I get paid towards the end of the months. Thanks everyone have a pic of my dog for your time http://www.flickr.com/photos/benjaminbexson/7591908676/
0	Hello fellow Redditors! I'm a longtime lurker of reddit, and was recently informed about this subreddit by a friend who new that I was a little tight in the wallet. My wife and I have been married for just over 9 months, and while many other marriages first year are amazing, ours has not been. A few months before my wedding my parents asked to borrow some money to get out of debt, and being a kind-hearted person/good son. I lent them $5000.00, and told them that they did not have to rush to pay me back. Since that time my wife and I have struggled to make ends meet, my parents have gotten divorced, and I have been unable to hold down a job. This past month I was let go of my job at a pizza place, and had a complete breakdown. In order to pay rent for this month I've sold half of our furniture, our tv, and our car radio. We've barely made rent, but we won't be able to get some groceries until Monday. I'm just hoping someone on here has some sympathy for my wife and I, and we want you all to know that we will pay it forward as soon as we can. Thank you very much, and God Bless!
0	Hey everyone! We're a couple who are also a team of entrepreneurs on a budget. We're starving with no food in our fridge currently because all of our funds from our recently completed project are tied up in paypal for another day or so waiting for the funds to transfer into our bank account. We're working late night on projects tonight and hoping someone will keep us alive with a pizza. Would love to return the favor for another pizza loving individual. Thanks! Have a wonderful night everyone!
0	hi my names Alex ("Angel" to friends) i'm 23, just moved out of my house today because my roommates didn't want to pay their half of bills and in the process of going through my first eviction even though i was the responsible one. payed for myself to have a hotel for the week so i wasn't in the street (no family here and not wanting to go to a shelter) and realized there was no left over money for food. i was talking with an old friend of mine and he said something about the site. i couldn't believe it lol kinda crazy when u think about it but i wanted to try it out and see if it was a real thing. So if there is a "Giver" who wouldn't mind, i would be more than appreciative,                                                                     All my Sincerity,                                                                               ANGEL &lt;3   
0	As the title says, I would be more than happy to pay it back/forward when I get paid next week. 
1	I work as a sub-contractor and my boss decided to leave town when he owed me money for this week's work. I had been counting on that money because my kids are here until Tuesdy night. My 7 yo daughter even mentioned how I never have anything good to eat here (it was completely innocent, but still hits home). Glad to buy someone a pizza Tuesday night... In need right now though. Anyone? 
1	My wife and I are both full time students. She has an all-day class today and will be out of the house until 7:00 PM. I'm a graphic design student with 2 major projects to finish by Monday.   I feel terrible for my kids (7, 5, &amp; 4). They are doing so good entertaining themselves while we get ready for finals, and I wish I could do something for them. But we are completely broke (students, after all). Would someone mind treating them to some delicious pizza?
0	Please don't judge that my account is new, I know it is frowned upon. But I was referred to here by an old friend who had received help here before.   Me and the room mate have been struggling on cut hours to make ends meet, but this week has been hell. My kitchen has become full of gnats, and despite all my cleaning and scrubbing of every corner they refuse to leave. Now, i know it can take a while for them to go away, but what's frustrating about it is that I put my last bit of spending money into trying to get rid of these things. My girlfriend won't let me cook for her in fear of these things getting in the food.  Now, we get paid again in just a couple of days. And a pizza is all we need to get us there. I hate begging, I do. But once we get paid and I am able to spend again I promise to either pay back the person that helped me, or pay it forward. Anyone please?
0	The Wednesday before Christmas I was fired from my job.  I previously worked for major corporations and moved to an independent computer repair company because I thought it would be a better opportunity.  After my first two weeks I noticed that some less than ethical and legal things were happening.  I saw the companies 40 + year old head tech go through a teenage girls picture file because he thought she was attractive and also the company wasn't following labor laws.  I raised a concerns because I could have been held liable for some of the issues that were happening.  A few days later I was fired, the reason was "You don't fit in with our company".  I'm looking for another job and until then repairing computers for friends, but a random act of pizza would defiantly help restore my faith in humanity.  I know my account is new, but I can easily give you proof that I am legit.  I suppose in the long run I may not have a job, but I do have my ethics.  
0	So uh me and my Friend are gonna be playing some FIFA 12 and smoking some...tobacco. Uh. So. Pizza would be rad.  If you'd be willing to wait until Friday when I get paid, I'll buy your wonderfully nice face a pizza to munch on, too.   if I can be nitpicky, no dominoes. I like, y'know, good, edible pizza. :3
0	Hey all,  Figured I would give this a go.   I'm Broke and currently looking for work, I don't have ANY food in the house (I finished the last of it last night, tomato sauce sandwich woot!) and haven't had anything today bar coffee and water :(  So yeah, hurts me to do this but anyone feel like shouting me a pizza? There would be much love!!!
0	Got evicted a few weeks ago due to my dad and I (we're roomates) falling upon difficult financial times. Thanks to the generosity of some friends, I've had a place to stay for the last 2 weeks.  However, things are getting really tight as I wait for my next paycheck to be deposited (the 5th). I already feel overextended with the friends who have been lodging me, and would prefer not to have to ask them for money/food as well.  If there are any redditors out there who are in a position to help, I would be extremely grateful and will do my best to reciprocate the favor. A pizza will most definitely get me through to my next paycheck and keep me afloat. Verification code / address / pics / anything else you want available upon request!  I'm very grateful to even have a place to ask for help, so thank you very, very much.   -Nick  *EDIT: I deleted my initial post because of some formatting errors (no request tag or location)*
0	I've had a difficult time dealing with this disease and being that I have no health insurance, it has left me pretty broke. I'm living off of ramen noodles at this point and would really like to change it up a bit. Maybe the change will help my mental state a bit?
0	Several hundred deducted from my checking account and now I have no cash. Can anyone pay me forward a pizza to help bridge the gap until pay day? Pizza Hut and Papa John's exist within delivery range. San Mateo, CA
0	I must leave the house I'm at in a few days. I don't have a place to go from here and haven't had the money for an actual filling meal in a while. I'm nervous about what's going to happen, but I'm also just thinking about my stomach too. I don't think I can eat another bite of Ramen or dollar store mac and cheese today. If anyone could help me I appreciate it beyond imagination. I would also save someone else once I land on my feet. I believe in Karma and sending it forward. Thanks for reading my woes.  Robin
0	This is one of times where cash is short and I'm trying to make my Friday night home a good one tonight. Mostly producing electronic music and occasionally playing dota2. Some pizza would hit the spot and make this a superb night. Just some cheap Dominos or whatever. Let me know if you want to help out! Thank you very much.
0	Plus, I've never met any local redditors.
1	Hello everyone. I don't get paid until Friday and I would love to be able to get some pizza tonight for dinner instead of eating ramen noodles one more night. If anyone could help us out that would be so awesome. It is me, boyfriend, and my two boys. I hope everyone has a great day:) Also I have recieved on this site before. 
0	He turned 6 last saturday and wanted pizza for his birthday but we don't have the money to get him any. I had an interview earlier today also, and the guy made it sound like I had the job. So it'd be nice to celebrate these things with some pizza!  We have a domino's here.
0	I switched careers recently and won't be able to eat this week. It takes a lot for me to even ask here.  *Edit- I'm a bouncer now! Now if only I could eat enough to look like one. It's such a perfect job for me. All I've ever wanted to be is a ninja, and this fits so well. Do you have any idea how many calories sparring, weightlifting, parkour (ing) requires? Squirrels are not bulky.
0	This is not for me, but for a family with five kids that live about 4 blocks away from me.  A fire destroyed their home Monday evening, and they lost everything.  I can't imagine how devastating that must be, but I'd love for them to be overwhelmed with compassion. Here is the link to the news article, including who to contact in order to contribute.

1	I feel a little weird asking this as I don't really NEED a pizza but it's been a tough few months and the idea of cooking anything is just more than I can handle at the moment. I recently switched jobs and haven't had a day off since the end of September, had my boss basically tell me to fuck off regarding my scheduling and had a panic attack in the middle of my shift in front of customers. I'd love a pizza but simply cannot afford to order one. Anyone in the Portland, OR area want to help me out? I'll eat everything except for olives and pineapple.  
0	I've been told about this website from various sources and I think this is an amazing place because I love pizza!  I have a couple people over to have a good time, we bought some beer, and now we have the drunkin munchines. HELP!   A future request for pizza will be accepted by me. 
1	Honestly, I didn't want to come down to this and request a pizza, but I haven't ate anything all day but rice. Finals are coming up for my summer session and I would appreciate a pizza to cheer me up. If you can't I completely understand I plan to give back once I get a paycheck. I'm located in New Jersey. Thanks for everything.
0	Just sitting at home on this lazy afternoon thinking of a nice pizza.
0	So I'm moving from the Chicago northwest suburbs to denver soon and am flat broke untill I sell my truck. I'd love some pizza to fill me up tonight!
0	So, I made a throwaway account for this, I hope that's not against RAOP reddiquette. A ton of my friends are on reddit, and none of them know about my financial issues, and I'd like to keep it that way.  I don't have it as bad as some, but I'm freaking starving and this check went totally to other bills. I spearfish to supplement store bought food, but there has been a red tide in San Diego for the past week or so with horrible visibility so I haven't caught anything. Lobster season opens soon though!  So long story short, if you are looking to send out a pizza, I would sure be thankful!  
1	Hey there fine folks of RAOP! I'm a sophomore here at Texas State University. This year has been particularly tough on me financially, but I've managed to stay afloat until now. I have a disease called Hidradenitis Suppurativa. I would not suggest google searching, unless you'd like to lose your appetite. I've been living with the disease for six years and it's been incredibly difficult. I get large cysts, sometimes the size of baseballs.. in my underarms, between my breasts and in my groin area. This makes it so hard to move any of my extremities, really. My insurance recently stopped paying for my medications, so I'm having to spend $2,200 a month to keep myself able to function properly. I have tried so hard to keep myself above water, but it's impossible with all of the medical bills from radiation therapy (not covered by insurance) and medication expense. I'd really love to have something, ANYTHING for dinner. Of course, when I'm able, I will pay it forward.  EDIT: I can offer to purchase you something from Amazon in exchange for pizza.. I'm broke cash wise, but I do have a bit of money on my Amazon account.
0	I'm out of food, can't afford a car, and not in walkable distance from a pizza place. If anyone helps, I'll post a thank you with proof of pizza, and pass it on. Thanks!
0	Anyone that has gone through them knows that student finance in the UK is TERRIBLE. I have just moved in and I have 3.50 to my name unil mid next week. Im gonna do my best to get hold of my parents but they are at a music festival called alchemy until monday/tuesday so its gonna be hard.   Location area is nottingham, uk. 
1	Hey, I don't normally do this kind of thing, but it would really help me right now. I have found myself to be recently homeless with no food or money, and being that I am hypoglycemic, I probably should do something about it. If anyone could send me a pizza, I could make it last me several days and it would keep my glucose levels at least somewhat stable. This is a temporary situation and I intend to get back onto my feet, but for now I am in need of any kind of help I can get. I would greatly appreciate it.
0	All I have to eat is this chocolate my mom left me, our fridge is empty except for a door full of condiments(including hot sauce which would go terrifically on a pizza). I don't have any excuses why I am deserving of this pizza, but I desire it with all of my being!  
1	Hey RAOP, I'm college student living with a couple friends right now. After having about a dollar in my bank account for about 4 weeks I finally started working last week and will get paid on Friday. Unfortunately we are running out of food, and a pizza sounds just wonderful right about now. If anyone out there is willing to help us out, we'd be forever grateful! :) 
1	About a month ago I lost my job and my wife and I were barely able to get by and we got a bit of help here and there from family and friends and a pizza from a great redditor.  Unfortunately things got worse.  I still havent found a job and three nights ago my wife moved out because "im not providing so why should I stay".  And while I know she has a point ive been left more or less crippled at home.  No job.  No money from no job.  No car now.  And she took the cat...  And ive spent the last moth sellung anything I can to make money.  Im at around -500 in my account because I overdrsfted to make my phone and lights stay on.  My phone is my only means of computing or communication I sold the cokputer.  Anyways I havent eaten in a few days and only vary sparingly before that and would just like a pizza to make me a little less depressed.  Any help would be greatly appreciated snd anything I can do back I would in aan instant.  Thank you
0	To be honest I don't really have much of a sob story. I'm just broke and really hungry.. Lol. Anyone wanna help out a fella?
1	Me and my girlfriend are currently in the process of moving and thus are having money problems. If someone could help us out right now that would be awesome and after the whole fiasco that is moving is over I will return the favor! 
0	Hey Reddit! This is my first post ever on here. I've been a lurker for almost a year now but I'm not much of a talker in general. I have two girls 6 and 9. I support them on my own and make sure they have everything they need. Here's the issue. [Paypal is holding all my cash](http://i.imgur.com/HeyOJ.jpg), as per usual. I wasn't expecting it to be held this long. However I'm almost 100% positive it will be released Monday or Tuesday. If someone could help out me out, I can send you $5 now and the rest once it is released. Tonight we are fine but tomorrow we will have nothing left. My mother is coming down Sunday to lend me some groceries until the money get's transferred to my bank account. I can give you any information needed. I'm not asking for handouts, I will pay it back. 
0	My girlfriend and I are both recent college graduates, and while my career is in very high demand (and I had no trouble finding a job), she's been struggling these last six months trying to make contacts and get her foot in the door. Unfortunately, education is taking a pounding in this economy and she has her degree in K-12 Art Education, in New Jersey.   In the short amount of time my girlfriend doesn't spend subbing or working at her near minimum-wage job to barely make ends meet, she's cold-calling school districts and putting out resumes left and right. It would be one thing if she wasn't trying, but it pains me to see my girlfriend put in all this effort and have nothing pay off.  I would love to be able to surprise my girlfriend with some new teaching contacts, or some new leads or even some ideas of other jobs that could utilize her degree and background until a position comes up.   I feel awkward writing this, but please, I am NOT looking for money. While I would appreciate the gesture there are more deserving posts here that could use monetary assistance. I just know how powerful and far the reach of Reddit goes, and know that everyone loves to help a guy with a novelty throwaway account! Thanks for any and all help.  
0	A good friend of mine from middle school passed away and I'm feeling awful. Normally I try to suck it up when it comes to how my scrimping and saving is affecting my groceries but fuck it, tonight I'm just not having it. Not tonight, probably not tomorrow night either.   I just want to gorge myself on pizza. I know these posts are usually ignored but it at least helped to vent a bit. Still, I wish I could have one more hilarious, snarky and thoughtful conversation with my friend over pizza.
1	I get paid in a week, so I've got rice and beans, ramen, and pasta to last me until then. If you've ever seen the movie Pay It Forward, I'll be sure to do that when I have any money at all. Any kind of pizza sounds amazing! D: 
0	No food, no money, if anyone could be so kind.
1	Please, I've tried this before but I never get a pizza :( I've been unemployed for 4 months. Welfare covers just the rent. I haven't had pizza in ages.  
0	It sure would make my day to get a pie. 
1	Just found out I have about $20 to last me 2 weeks. There is a delay in processing my student loans, so I'm left a little high and dry until that happens. My family has no money (literally unable to give me even a $100) and they're in a different state, so I can't ask them for anything. I'm a little embarrassed to ask, but I've been a redditor for a long time and just stumbled across this amazing subreddit.  This is something I will payback multiple times when I finally get back on my feet. It sucks to be in this position, so I can't wait until I can help someone out, too!  EDIT: CayucosKid totally came through!!! Definitely my hero, I can't thank him enough!
0	Pepperoni, and cheese is all we need no fancy toppings we are just hungry 
0	I dont know how this works, but my friend is turning 21 January 21 and I think it would be awesome for some awesome Redditor to give him a random act of pizza. He is a redditor himself and would go crazy over something like that. 
0	Parents are at a party until much later - they forgot to leave us cash to buy dinner.  We're snacking on dry cereal but pizza would be great :D
0	I'm already a bit strapped for cash this summer.  But I manage to have a good time.  Unfortunately, on my way to my friend's house last night in the Champaign region, I got robbed at gunpoint near my house.  While he didn't get really any money from me, he got my phone, ID, and cards, and without those, I can't use the little money I have, especially since all of those will have to be replaced... for money.  :/  My friend suggested this to me, and I was wondering if any of you could help me out.  Thanks for listening ^_^.
0	One of my good friends has recently been kicked out of his dad's house. He's 19, and has no where to go. I guess he's been staying in the parking lot of the store by my house, and he finally just mustered up the courage to ask for a warm bed for a few nights. My mom and I have such a bed, but we have very little funds. We've been living off free bagels and bananas for a while now. I can keep going off of that but I know my friend could really use something more special. I don't think he's actually eaten for a couple days. Anyways, I'm in Boise Idaho, and he'll be staying the night tonight. He's already really appreciative of the bed, but doesn't know I'm trying to do this. I'm working right now, but when I get my paycheck I'll be sure to pay it forward. If anyone can help out, it would mean the world to me, and him. Thanks for being an awesome subreddit.
0	Our rent spiked up by $120 (now being charged for Water and Garbage, monthly pet rent, and increased rent rate) coincidentally on the same month she is graduating college, so things have been a bit crappy the past two weeks. All of our money has gone to the new place, and I know some Dominos would bring her some much needed relief, if even for a night. I appreciate even checking out my post, thanks everybody!
0	we are all studying aboard and like everyone else here we are having financial issues but nothing that serious. If you are feeling a bit generous today, go ahead and make our day :)  Info: 5 students, 3 Spanish, 1 Canadian and one arabic. Also you can always order stuff online if you dont feel like calling,   Thanks. ^_^ 
0	To whom it may concern, I just bombed a Math test and now I will be up all night studying for Finals and doing most of my Math work that is do tomorrow. If anyone could take pity on a brother I would greatly appreciate it. 
0	I'm dealing with some severe depression, caused by mental illness and right now all my money is being thrown at my doctors to help me get through this. I have little food in my home, all of which needs to last me until the 8th when I can go grocery shopping again. I'm feeding myself, so I don't need a lot, really anything will help. I'm in Salem, OR if that helps any. Thanks.  -Keasbey15
1	Long story short i'm broke and unemployed at the moment so I can't take my mom out like she deserves.
0	Hey everyone, I'm a college student who lives west of Pittsburgh, PA. It's been one of those weeks. I'm sure you have been there before. Today I had to make the unfortunate decision between paying bills and eating. Unfortunately, the bills prevailed. My anxiety shot through the roof today, and I had to leave class early because I was having a panic attack. I figure I could use a hug right now, but a pizza will more than suffice. I'm not expecting much of anything, even some words of kindness and encouragement would be much appreciated. There is some good news to all of this: I recently got hired full time as a programming analyst. Unfortunately I don't start until early next year, so I am stuck in this situation for a while. I will be more than glad to return the favor some day to anyone who decides to help.  Thanks!  edit:  I am actually a real person! [Look!](http://s0.i1.picplzthumbs.com/upload/img/98/c9/82/98c9826b27d5b5e8a2a8fb5b36a121755dbde805_wmeg_00001.jpg)
0	My boss who I came here with has gone to visit friends and I have no transportation except walking. Was hoping RAoP could help a brother out with a pizza for one. I would of course tip the driver. (with my money not yours lol)
0	I just got a new job; and between public transportation and having to actually do laundry twice a week, I've been drained of my savings. (Granted I didn't have much left). A pizza would be amazing right now. I'll send decent art in return, at your request!   and of course, I'll pay it forward once I get paid.  I live in Morgantown WV. I don't know what else to say, except for thanks! This is a beautiful place.
1	My brother and I are both broke, unemployed USMC veterans who are trying to find jobs for the summer in between college semesters (Good news! We have interviews with the same business tomorrow afternoon.) We've both been working odd jobs during the graveyard shift, so we're up all night and sleep during the mid-morning/early afternoon. We've been spacing out the few dollars we had for ramen noodles, but even our change jars are empty now. Since we haven't eaten since Saturday, a pizza would be the best thing ever. Plus, I'm sure we could make it last a couple days. I will absolutely pay it forward once we get some money coming in.
0	So I'm enjoying the last days of unemployment (starting next Wednesday woo!) by setting a blanket outside with a pillow and a power strip long enough for me to take my laptop outside and a book (The Forever War). I'm not in particular need, but it's a gorgeous day, and I'm feeling like being a slug and it's my birthday tomorrow (me and my twin sister). Never done this before, not quite sure of the process. Again, not necessary at all and completely random!   I love what you guys do here and will contribute once everything starts up. That being said, as far as random acts of cookies goes, someone motivate me to try out that recipe for key lime meltaways please! Also, let me know if there's any verification needed for anything. Or if there's any special procedure I should follow. If I do this, I want to do it right!
0	I finally got back on my feet and got a place to live. The only thing is, I would sort of love a pizza just for the hell of it! I have food, but I can't afford eating out. I'm just here hoping. Thanks for reading!
0	My husband and I are expecting our first baby after struggling to conceive. Yesterday we had our first ultrasound and it went AMAZING! We heard the heartbeat and it was magical.   Would just love to not have to cook supper for us and to celebrate a great day with a pizza since it's pouring rain here.
1	My wife and are a just a couple of broke college students (we are both starbucks baristas). We have  couple of starbucks veggie plates to eat, but would love some pizza! (and maybe breadsticks?)  Thanks, you guys are all super heroes :)
0	I can provide proof by taking photos of my incisions if need be--only sold one art print which had to go to gas money since I've been out of the hospital..CRAVING PIZZA!!!  Never asked here, so I'm not sure if I'm doing this wrong..but coming out of all that terrible pain and being able to enjoy some pizza would be rad!  Thanks, Jess
0	the aroma fills the air  as i wait patiently to eat  pepperoni, cheese, and sausage  all are such a delicious treat  
0	I've been home bound with our dog who needs hip surgery while my grandma is in the hospital with her knee. Tired of frozen dinners :(
1	I am pretty hungry and I thought it would be nice to have a pizza with my family. I live right outside of Cle Elum, Washington.
1	These are the reasons we NEED pizza:  1. One of our roommates is lost in a storm and we would like her to have some melty, tomatoey, cheesy goodness when (if) she survives and makes it back to our dorm. 2. One roommate is banging her head on her desk and if we had a pizza it would be a good cushion so she wouldn't hurt her head. 3. Our toes and fingers are cold and we could use the leftover pizza to warm them. 4. One roommate has an exam and is laughing hysterically. Probably to keep from crying. We think pizza would help. 5. This same roommate just announced that she had to fart. We need pizza aromas to cover up the smell of her toxic waste. 6. Lucy is lost. 7. We can't have our pet unicorn in the dorm, so we think pizza would be the next best thing to have (sloths aren't allowed, either). 8. I just needed to have one more reason so that our list would have an even number of reasons because odd numbers are gross.  Peace and blessins' 
0	You would make me a very happy person.
1	Dear RAoP, I am a freelance graphic/web designer working out of my apartment in fabulous Dallas, TX. I also happen to be about 9 weeks 5 days pregnant with my first child. I am extremely hungry, and nothing in my kitchen is doing it for my cravings. (Any pregnant/former pregnant women know what I am talking about!) I have tried to reason with Oran/Orenda and let s/he know that Mama hasn't gotten paid yet, and cannot obtain the pineapple and tomato sauce that seems amazing. However, reasoning does nothing for hormones and fetuses, so I turn to you guys at Random Acts of Pizza. Can someone help, and I will gladly pay it forward/back come Friday!  Proof of an ultrasound can be provided upon request  ***request answered thanks jeffreydonger***
0	I'm having a band meeting in south Philadelphia for my one manned band and between my manager and I... we forgot food. In return for a cheesy delight I will repay you with a video of me playing an original song with your name in it... and maybe mail you a cat.
0	I got a job at Dominos recently but they are having trouble getting me through the system and it is taking forever to actually start my training. So if I get a pizza tonight instead of eating PBJ I will pay it forward very soon.
0	Yea..  This was a new job that I really enjoyed after 3 months of unemployment and filling applications. Rent's paid, thank goodness, but I've already promised the power company my paycheck (and then some). I've got some food to last me the end of the week but just don't want to start the ramen already. I could use a pizza for dinner tonight, guys, and a smile. 2012's been rough.
1	i would love nothing more than a large pizza so i can cuddle on the couch with the boys and pop in a movie.  thanks so much in advance, it would mean the world to me at this moment.  feeling a little overwhelmed. 
0	So yeah, I got screwed over at work, I only have a box of Raisin Bran Crunch, a pack of little smokies, 5 oz of bacon, and a bottle of ketchup until Wednesday (and contrary to my username I am not, in fact, drowning in pudding). Any pizza-related help would be much appreciated. Thanks reddit.
0	As the title says i only got $30 left untill friday, i already ate all the frozen food i got and the fridge is empty... i feel lame not having breakfast but if any kind person could help me today i will double what you give me on friday. =]
0	I'm out of funds until Wednesday and there's no food left.  I'm really, really hungry and if anyone could help me out it would be phenomenal.  
1	So I had an ex-roommate who owed me a portion of the deposit from our last place, and I stupidly gave him my bank info so he could wire the funds to me. Note: I used to have a wells fargo account so thats how we used to transfer funds easily for rent etc... but I moved and found it easier to use a schwab account since they refund atm fees and having a brokerage account all in one was nice for when I wanted to start trading.   He took this and then basically managed to create an e-check to citi to pay for a credit bill. Why the fuck citi decided hey lets accept a check from a random person to cover another persons bill I will never know. Schwab didn't stop it in time so it took out a good chunk of my checking account before I noticed what had happened. After spending hours on the phone over this last week with the fraud dept, I was told that they would create a new checking account for me and transfer my remaining funds, but that my debit card would remain active.  Today I'm at a gas station trying to fill up when my card doesn't go through. I call and found out there is nothing they can do it to link my old card with my new account and that they have to send me a new card, which wont be here till monday. So I had to spend my last 10 dollars in cash to get enough gas just get home. (If you don't now how schwab works can't walk into a branch and just withdraw money, you have to use your debit card at an atm, thats why they refund the fees) Now to add to all of this when I was younger I messed up my credit pretty badly, and I have been working to fix it recently but its still not good enough to get a credit card without just getting raped on fees. So basically I have no acces to any money at all until my new checks or debit card arrives.   Also being a single guy during finals I didn't really stock up the fridge that well, so I am standing infront of my fridge/pantry to see that I only have 5 eggs, 7 slices of bacon (the one thing that may keep me sane lol), a little oatmeal and lots of moldy veggies left. Now I could stretch what I have l easily for 2ish days, but that still leaves me short tonight and tomorrow. I normally am not the kind of person to ask for a handout but if anyone could help me during this perfect shitstorm that would be make my week. The second I have access to my accounts and money again I plan on passing it along.   TL;DR: I got fucked by my ex-roomate. To "protect" me schwab locked all my accounts while telling me I would still be able to use them. So i've got no money till monday and am just short of food to make it till then.  edit: never done this so forgive me. forgot to add that im in the san diego area  edit2: RZF291 is a scholar and a gentlemen! Thank you so much again!
0	I'm saving up money to buy a new phone, and could really use a pizza right now. I haven't eaten anything other than the stuff I have at home, and could use a little change. I'd be glad to pay it forward once I buy this phone and have money to spend.  Edited for redundancy.
0	Hey there. I want to thank you in advanced for reading this post and commenting. :) I appreciate it.   I would love a stranger to make my week with a pizza :)  My baby is sick with a cough cold and fever, she has been having horribal nights meaning I haven't gotten much sleep for a few nights. I would love a warm hot pizza so I could get a break from cooking and giving her medicen every four hours.  I am willing to send a handwritten note or take a picture of the box with a special message for you. :)   xoxo
0	Will give reddit gold for pizza! broke and hungry. Please help it's all I have to offer!
0	2 Iraq vets (army) and one submariner navy goon here.  We're all pretty much broke until our GI Bill money starts kicking in at the end of the month.  The cupboard is bare, the bank accounts are dry until the navy guy gets paid next thursday. anyone willing to toss us a couple pies?  
0	My sister, an amazing person, is in a bit of a financial pinch. I really want to try to do something nice for her, but I'm in a bad patch myself. If anyone would be willing to help me send her and her family (husband, presschool son) a pizza to start off a nice weekend, I would appreciate it greatly. Thanks so much in advance for the consideration.
0	:)  What do you want a drawing of?  (I can even mail it to you if you want.)  Or what do you want me to write a poem about?    
0	I love you all
0	My sister and her husband and son are visiting my family.  We've tried to provide a nice stay for them.  We bought what food we could and cooked good meals as much as we could.  They've insisted on taking us out a few times and spent more money than I'm comfortable with.  Now he's decided that we should have pizza tonight, and their kid and our two kids are all excited, and that's great.  I just would really like to be able to pay for one thing this entire trip that they're here.  I've been unemployed for almost six months.  My wife is a bartender, and she's at work now, and we're hoping she makes at least $100 to cover the checks that are out for rent and bills.  I don't have any extra money to spend on pizza, but I'm tired of feeling worthless while they take care of everything.  There are six of us, and I'd like to be able to pick up a couple of pies and at least feel human again.  It's funny how being on here and asking strangers for help somehow seems less demeaning than taking help from family.  I don't know.  Just figured I'd ask.  Thanks for listening.  Feels good to get it out at least.  
1	Made a throw away because I don't want my friends or family to know I'm short on cash atm. I hate asking for things, especially to my friends and family so I made this throw away to ask reddit instead. I am willing to provide my main account which is over a year old, requested once before but I also gave a pie in return as well.  Atm bit broke while waiting for work since school just finished and was hoping for a pizza. I of course plan to either return the favor to the person who sends it or will be posting up another offer in the next few days when my payment is confirmed from paypal and I have cash again while searching for work. 
0	I had knee surgery, and I've been wanting pizza. I was hoping I could win a contest but it's been a no go. I just really want some pizza. Oh and I can't go anywhere because I'm on percocet, kind of sucks ha ha.
0	Hi I a m new to this site hope that I do this right.  Im wishing for a pizza today for my family.  We have not have anything as I am awaiting approval for snap and currently no food pantrys today.  Hope someone out there would grant our wish. We have a Dominos.. pizza hut in our town.  Thankyou so much and godbless
0	sister was so engrossed watching game of thrones (understandable excuse) that she didn't hear the buzzer for the oven, luckily i heard the smoke alarm. please help two broke, hungry students trying to get through a freezing Melbourne downpour and enjoy some Game of Thrones.
0	I am getting ready for all my portfolio reviews coming up, and studying for History. I'm super hungry and totally broke. I'd love a slice.  If you order me a pizza I'll send you an 8x10 print of my work :]
0	It seems like a lot of requests are from people who had requested repeatedly in the past, sometimes that is all they post on reddit. I would like to give a pizza to a redditor who has contributed lots of non-pizza posts.   I'll plan on giving the person I choose a pizza tomorrow. PM me :)  EDIT: Thanks for everyone who messaged me. I've picked the pizza recipient! All further entries won't be considered. Have a great day!
1	The lease for our apt is up here in the next week, and we will be moving back to the Midwest, but the cupboards are bare as our checks have gone entirely to bills / moving expenses (shipping your life is $$). Would love to have something besides the leftover ramen in the fridge to go with the night of cleaning ahead of us in the empty apt. We will pay it forward!
0	[This posting](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frugal/comments/iad11/what_can_i_do_to_survive_really_strapped_for_cash/) by redditor katehawk910 makes it sound like his/her situation could use some pizza lovin' to alleviate the money he/she would have to spend on food. I'm at work at the moment, are there any other redditors who would be able to help this person out?
0	Recently I have started back at university for year 2 and my funding application hasn't been processed yet. I have been volunteering with my local charity and although the work is good and I'm getting experience and references and all that, I'm not earning any money. My application probably won't be processed for another two weeks and until it is i'll have no money, and most importantly, no pizza.
0	So, my new apartment is right across the street from Godfathers! They must have just opened because without A/C I have to have the windows open. I can smell the great food and I'm sooo hungry without any $$ :( anyone willing to help out? Please :)   
0	I lost my job, I am not begging, but I will not lie, Pizza would be a good cheer-er up-er :)
1	I knew this subreddit existed, but hadn't thought about it lately. I was about to preheat the oven to cook my usual dinner..a dollar tree 1$ "Celeste" brand mini pizza and a dollar tree burrito. Thats totally fine, cant complain life is good...but I realized hell its my bday, Im an electrical engineering senior that busts his ass constantly and lives off nothing, no job, just fafsa  (thats long out by now), maybe someone will think I deserve a pizza.    Proof of everything I have said above (plus you could just fb me to verify with all the info available from picture): removed   Edit:Wow I believe in reddit. Thanks and goodnight.
0	Welcome our 1st (and hopefully only *fingers crossed*) baby to Earth a week &amp; a half ago. Needless to say running on 1-3 hours of sleep a day and paying off doctor &amp; hospital has left us with very little money after essential bills have been paid. We're gaining a room mate next month which will free up money to reciprocate a pizza to a Redditor. Until then any thing helps!
0	TL;DR  I lost my wife because she cheated on me with 3 of my cousins. She got custody of my son. Her lawyer fucked me in the ass and now I am about to bankrupt.  *Throwaway account
0	Spent all of our money for food on rent. Only one of us is working and we have a lil one to feed too. First timers, please help if you can, GOD bless.

0	I don't get paid until next week and my parents left me little food to work with before they left on vacation. I've been eating eggs nearly everyday since thats all there really is to cook in my kitchen. They come back on Sunday and I'm all out of eggs. It's been a depressing 3 weeks and a pizza is all I'm craving to celebrate surviving on eggs this whole time.  
0	Good evening Redditors! My friend Francois and I are hanging out this evening and we just decided to try reddit. We were looking around and found RAOP and we thought what a good night it would be if our first reddit experience was joined by pizza! So we are asking for a kind soul to hook us up! We are also willing to do something for you, udk what but we could make you a funny video or send you pics of our cute dogs and cat, or I manage a band, we could give you a shoutout on our FB page! Thank you very much!
0	So I'm a 19 year old guy who had colon surgery the other day. I've been stuck at home for a while and have depleted all of the microwavable food I've had. I must have eaten 10 packs of ramen over the past few days and a pizza would be great. If anyone is offering, it'd be greatly appreciated.   EDIT: Just found out Domino's doesn't deliver to my house (I live too out of the way, I guess) and I can't leave because of the pain killers I'm on. Only place that delivers is Papa Ginos. Sorry for the inconvenience everyone. =/
0	Philadelphia, Hospital of the Univeristy of Pennsylvania Emergency Department. PM with details. You guys are awesome.
0	Hello, RAOP. Nothing particularly wrong is going on in my life at the moment other than I am craving pizza and don't get paid until the 10th. If anybody wanted to help me out, it would be greatly appreciated. Thanks. 
0	My GF and I both work at Kroger which pays not well at all. We both have no money that can go towards food and have been eating rice for a week. Our fridge broke this week so all of our refrigerated food had to be thrown away or eaten a couple days ago. Any pizza would be appreciated. Thank you ahead of time if you can offer. Also, We live in Atlanta, Ga.  
1	Hi everyone. I usually just lurk around reddit and read but I'm here today because I really need help. I usually do ok with bills and food but this month I had some unexpected bills and we are out of food. I posted in food pantry and Assistance but someone told me maybe look here also. I was wondering if someone could help wit maybe a 15 dollar gift card so I can feed the kids tonight. I hate to come here and beg and I probably should have come earlier but I hate hate hate to ask for help. We have a dominos and they have those 5.99 pizzas if you order 3 and I have 4.oo so if someone could help I would be so thankful. I get paid on Monday and I would happily send it back. Thank you for reading.
0	Extremely hungry 23 year old in between jobs and out of stuff to pawn here (except my computer but lets be real, I'm not gonna pawn it lol), hoping to find a kind soul that would like to put pizza in my belly. PM me for my address I live in downtown Charleston, SC. You can choose between any of the big chains as well as a few stores. I'd prefer Papa Johns but its up to you
0	Hey RAOP, I've been suspended from work for about two weeks now due to a damage claim and corp. policy and just stretching my savings out to it's breaking point. Anyway some kind person can send a pizza my way?
0	I just got an crash with my new car.   my job is not working so good as it should and my date got cancelled..  so its a very sad friday..  if there is anybody who wanna cheer me up with some good food.  Thank you pictures for sure.. i would appreciate much    Greetings from Frankfurt am Main / Hessen/ Germany
0	Hey guys,  If someone could hook it up with a pizza while I do some homework that would be awesome.  I'm low on cash cuz I had to buy some school supplies.  I'll be able to get some next week and I will give a pizza out in return.  Thanks
1	I've never done this and I should probably use a throwaway, but whatever. I've been unemployed, again, for a few weeks now and my unemployment checks are less than half of what I was making when I was working. I've applied to over twenty jobs in the past month and only one has even gotten back to me to say that they had found someone better suited. All of my bills and rent are/were late, I can barely afford enough food, and, to top it off, I can't even go snowboarding....which is truly the only thing that keeps me sane in the winter. All of my friends are snowboarders and most of them are out riding tonight. I'm not saying a pizza would cure the shit that's going through my head, but I could definitely use one to help restore some optimism in my life. EDIT: I know I'm not in the worst of shape with where I'm at, but I do battle with some very strong depression from time to time and right now is one of those times. Also, I'd always rather give than receive and bringing myself to ask for help is one of the hardest things for me to do.
0	Hi my name is Amber Brown i am the single mom to 3 children and I just lost my job a couple of weeks ago. I have been trying to find one with no luck yet, and I am in need of help getting food for the four of us. I was hoping there would be someone out there who could help me I would appreciate very very much.
0	My family (myself, husband, and 5 year old son) are in need of dinner tonight. We have been waiting for our paychecks that were supposed to show up on Tuesday. They have yet to come. Meanwhile, we have no food in the house. I have a friend that is coming to give us some cash to get through the next few days but she can't come until tomorrow morning - that's when she herself gets paid.  We are in desperate need for something to get us through tonight. We do have several pizza places and places to order in from (Dominos, Hungry Howies, Papa Johns to name a few) and am hoping some generous soul will be willing to help us in any way. I'm willing to provide any information needed to help! 
0	Pizza would hit the spot and be an amazing early birthday present to help me from succumbing to sleep instead of studying up!

0	We havent recieved our student loans yet (which are now two months late) and we are getting a bit sick of bread and pasta. We would really appreciate a dominoes because our overdrafts are nearly gone.  Thanks very much :)
0	My AMA was titled [IAMA wildly incompetent network security admin and have no business in my job. AMA.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cuc07/iama_wildly_incompetent_network_security_admin/)  If you goto [/r/IAMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/top/?sort=top&amp;count=75&amp;t=all&amp;after=t3_akrna) (link is already sorted) select "All time" and sort by "Top" you'll see it's ranked exactly #100.  The job was a nice run, but honestly I enjoyed writing the AMA more than I enjoyed my job.  It was soul crushing be so worthless and being paid for it. I know that sounds hard to believe, but I assure you, it's the truth.  At any rate, I'm depressed, but I'm excited to finally be free.  I will be going back into computers most likely, but something that I'm actually good at. Troubleshooting, help desk, etc.  Certainly not network security.    FWIW, i was actually laid off by the executives, not fired for incompetence.  My wife is out of town and she doesn't even know yet.  It's just me and my 3 kids hanging out tonight.  Anyone feel like sending a few medium pizzas our way?  The thank you pictures will be marvelous indeed.  Of course I can't show our faces, since the IAMA is rather incriminating... :)  I'm not proud, but I'm not ashamed!   edit:  It'll be [hot dogs and blueberry bagels](http://i.imgur.com/k2SlM.jpg) if nobody wants to help this worthless secadmin in another 30 min or so.  After that, I'll just delete this post. Last thing I need is to have more eyes gandering at that AMA when I start job hunting! :) 2nd edit:  well I'll call it for tonight.  I sincerely appreciate anyone that read this and considered Randoming a pizza to me, even if you decided against it.  Just the thought is worth it in my book.  We ate some dogs and bagels so we're g2g for tonight.  Thanks so much to everyone.   **EDIT:  I withdraw my request for a pizza.  There's others that deserve it more.  The fact that I was paid for a job that I was horrible at does make me feel like I shouldn't be asking for a pizza.  My family and I will be fine.  i appreciate all the offers.  **  **I ask that if you really were going to get me a pizza today, you instead get one for "halohoppe".  He obviously has such low opinions of majority of humanity that I think everyone would be better off if his faith was restored slightly. I'll admit I was upset when he posted twice about what a scumbag I am, and how I just like free shit, but he's right.  I do like free shit, and I was paid to be in a job that i was not fit for.  i had other duties and continued to work, and had a great boss who was more of a friend.  I have no reason to feel sorry for myself..  Please, get a pizza for halohoppe.  Maybe it will motivate him to pass it forward and actually earn that pizza slice next to his username before bashing others**
1	all of my money is going to bills, ramen, and food for my dog, hell, he's eating better than me most likely.
0	Please sir, may I have some pie?
0	I hate asking for help from people but we really don't have a choice right now. I made a throwaway account since everyone living with me is a redditor and I'd like to surprise them. I'm in Minnesota,north of Minneapolis.  Edit-Completely out of food now. Me and the other guy let the 3 girls eat the rest of the ramen. We didn't get food sadly. So we're out of food and no one gets payed until Tuesday. Edit-Seems like no one can a help me out which sucks but there's nothing I can do about it. Congrats to everyone that asked and received today, you're lucky=) 
0	Left my job last month due to anxiety issues and depression. Money has last a bit but the last bit is about to disappear. Partner is also off work due to illness and has been in and out of hospital and doctors offices for months.  Don't have anything in for dinner and just thought I would try and see if it was possible to get a little pizza please.  I haven't used this subreddit before I will be honest. I did give a guy portal 2 back in March though! Haha I don't know.   Hopefully I will get a job and return the pizza favour!  x
0	Probably a long shot. Broke, no real money til next week. Can provide pictures of kitten attempting to eat pizza.  Just gonna be lounging around watching football this weekend with my kitties, eating oatmeal, lol.  I'm in Georgia, but not a Georgia fan.
0	Warning: Sob story. Sorry :-/  For starters, sorry for using a throwaway account, but my situation is beyond embarrassing. Posting on my main won't do any good, I don't have any friends, much less anyone that knows me and likes me enough to help out. I understand if you choose to not help because of this, but I can also do my best to provide any proof you'd like within reason.  To keep it short and sweet, I don't have a place to stay right now. I have 2 degrees, recently graduated, but I did something stupid during my first year of college, and have a misdemeanor on my record that I believe has been preventing me from obtaining employment. I have been trying to save up to get it expunged but recently lost the retail job I did have over some really silly shenanigans (boss with nothing better to do than fire people). I managed to land a job interview this week, and was just notified I made it to round 2 on Monday, for a really decently paying position.  I lived check to check, so as of today I'll be living out of my car for 2-4 weeks until a good friend of mine moves into town, who's going to let me stay with him. Food and money is scarce, no way to make ramen anymore, so it'll probably be the dollar menu for a while. I've got one tank of gas to last me. Could someone toss a papa john's gift card my way? They're all over town... I'd be eternally grateful! I can't post on /r/loans because I don't know when I'll be able to pay back, and no way of preparing food from /r/foodpantry, so I figured this is the only assistance subreddit that could really help, even if only a meal for the weekend.   Well, that was not so short and sweet. Sorry... again &gt;_&lt;.  ps: If anyone knows of a way to make quick buck besides prostituting myself, please let me know. I'd be happy to do anything  
0	I would love a pizza right now. I don't have much money and am really craving a pizza. Please help, it'd be awesome.
0	Second day of classes and I'm low on funds and food. A friend is here with me in a fairly similar situation and we're low on hope as well. Won't someone lend a hand to two lads from Danville, VA?
1	to post on this again, as the first time I asked I told my story of little money no food for a few weeks someone screamed at me and told me to manage my money a little better, I was startled and scared hell I was even ashamed so I took it down...I'm new to reddit, I can only use it while borrowing a friends comp....so I don't have much of a history, but I don't really know where else to go, I'm not so bad off as in I have enough ramen to last me and my fiance a pack a day for a week, but we've been eating it for a while and would love a hot pizza, if you can help it would be appreciated, if not thanks for looking. thank you. 
0	I'm going to be completely honest here about my stupidity. I went to the store today and spent my last bit of money buying some alcohol and didnt even think about the fact that I have no food. Now I am at home, and have no money and no food in my house.  A friend of mine told me about you guys, so I thought I would give it a try. Thank you in advanced for even reading this.  Cheers
0	Hey,   I'm new to this so I really don't know if I'm doing this right. I live in Atlanta, GA 30305. I just moved out on my own for the first time in July and during the 3rd week of July I lost my job. I have rent coming up next week and my first check from my new job is expected then. But I'm hungry now. I don't have enough food to last me til then. I'm just trying to learn how to survive on my own. So if anyone can help I will appreciate you til the end of time!!! When it comes to pizza i'm not picky especially not at this point.
0	First of all, I just wanted to say that I love pizza, more than life itself. It would make things just a little better, especially with how things are for us right now.   Things have been spiraling downward lately. Me and my girlfriend were both laid off from our jobs, and since we had no money we were evicted from our apartment. We had friends willing to help us out, but they ALL told us at the last minute that they'd changed their minds. We ended up having to stay with my girlfriend's abusive parents (which was a nightmare in itself), and they decided to kick us out. On Christmas day nonetheless.   We're staying with a friend now while we look for jobs. I'm not sure how long we can stay here even if we do get jobs, but I do know that having a pizza would make this whole mess a little more bearable.
0	I know sappy stories are sometimes made-up or used to take advantage of people.  I hate to admit it, but this sappy story is true.  Today, my wife and I lost our youngest cat Tula to liver failure (that is assumed, waiting on the official results).  We rescued her 2 years ago after a fox attack her in the wild.  The vet was going to put her asleep , but my wife, the lover of most living creatures convinced me to take her in.  This week she refused food and eventually last evening passed away.  My wife did get to see her Thursday, but she looked "vacant".  We both agreed we would donate her to the local university for them to perform the autopsy and possibly see what caused her liver to fail.  I am asking for her for some pizza from the reddit community.  This is really for my wife because of the attachment that she had with her.  I can provide verification of Tula and the autopsy (when we get it).  But Pizza and bread sticks would cheer up my wife.  Thanks for at least reading this.  I will pay it forward sometime soon down the road.    **EDIT**  As promised here are photos of Tula.    http://imgur.com/acXQSIY http://imgur.com/r7FaJfG
0	My friends and I are trying to have a fun night before they leave for Seattle and we don't have enough money for pizza. Could someone be generous enough to supply us with pizza?
0	Just as the title says. I miss calculated my living expensive and ran out by May. Ive been living off student loan money since I've been having trouble with finding work. I had to sell just about everything of value except my phone and damaged tablet just to pay rent for the last few months. I just topped off my bag of rice and down to Oatmeal and a bag of Beans. I get this semester of loans in 2 weeks, but a Dominos pizza would make this US student very happy. Even just breadsticks would do.    Sorry for my long sob story.
0	This is my first request. I'm a student studying abroad in China, and a recent illness cost me a bit more money than I anticipated. I have over a month left here, and I would really appreciate the help.  You can check my post history for proof of my studies, and I have a verification code. Please let me know if you have any questions, and, if you're able to help, thank you so much.  EDIT: About 45 minutes left to order tonight. I'll update when they're no longer accepting orders, so message me any time before then. I'm really hungry :(  **EDIT 2: Ordering is closed for tonight. Perhaps some other time, though. Thanks, guys.**
1	I have been producing for over two years now with Ableton Live.  Some of my previous works can be heard here: www.soundcloud.com/djlactose  Just let me know what kind of music you'd like me to make for you in exchange.  I'm open to doing remixes as well.    I'm going to college in Colorado.  Let me know!
0	So, I've had a lot going on in my life right now, my girlfriend just broke up with me, and my whole families been going through a awful divorce, and I just keep being put in the middle of it.  By no means would a pizza solve all my problems, but, as silly as it seems, it would be nice to get something from someone for a change.
1	Hey RAoP, I feel bad even asking for this, but I've ran into a bit of a pinch. I recently lost my job, and my mother and brother-in-law had to come to stay with us until after the holidays due to losing their heat. Unfortunately we don't have the means to feed everyone. After going to get them because they have no car, we had to use what little money we had for gas. Thanks in advance! 
0	Hey, my roommate and I are running low on cash. He lost his job last week and I had to pay his month's rent, and I'm going to have to until he finds another job. If someone could help us out with a pizza that would be great!  Thanks!
0	Here's the story I have a sick three year old and was up all night. I am tired, my house is a disaster, and I feel lazy. We live on a limited income so can't afford to spend extra on pizza especially with school starting next week and trying to get kids ready with supplies, clothes, fees, and all the crap. I would love a pizza. If anyone has it in their heart to help me out we have Papa Johns, Dominos, Pizza Hut, and Little Ceasers opened yesterday.
0	My boyfriend, Kyle, is a very sweet guy. He recently moved in with some relatives (so he could be closer to me!), but they are having financial troubles, and in consequence do not have any food in their fridge, or cabinets. They usually are gone, and he feels bad asking for money/food.  I am a poor college student, and barely am able to afford my living expenses. But right now he is looking for a job (very diligently), and hasn't found one yet. He tells me every night that its "okay" 'cause he's living closer to me now, or that "I could stand to lose a few pounds". But this just makes me sad. He lives in Bellingham, Washington. If you are able/willing enough, post here/message me. It would make his (and my) day...maybe our week? If I can do anything in return, let me know. 
1	[REQUEST] I heard about this from a food pantry I go to, and thought I would give it a try. I have no money to eat out and am tired of the usual pasta, canned veggies and other non-perishable items. I would like to donate pizza to those in need, but right now, I am in need. All I would like is a $15-$25 Pizza Hut e-gift card so I can have something different to eat for two nights. Once my job kicks in (which will be at least three weeks), I will be giving back as well. Thank You from Paducah, Kentucky.
0	I've been having such a down week worrying about my sick mother, being overloaded at work, how we'll be paying rent and upcoming bills, let alone food, for the next week...I would absolutely love some warm food to help tidy my growling stomach and my mind in the meantime.  Our pantry is bare and I have little $ to my name at the moment.  I'm located in California by the way    I can PM you from my main account, I was just paranoid/ashamed because a simple google search provided much detailed information about me; I use that username all over the web..  Thank you, reddit~
0	My boyfriend ended our relationship of 7 years to go back to his ex. About 6 months ago he got back in contact with his ex and I really didn't think much of it. Alot of people connect on Facebook, Reddit, etc. so I didn't assume they were doing anything other than just chatting. Turns out his "late meetings for work" were actually times where he would go out with his ex. I only found this out a week ago when I called one of his co-workers who told me they never had any late meetings. I confronted him when he got home and he told me that he had been spending time with his ex and was in love with her. He moved out three days ago and I've been unable to leave the apartment. I'm so depressed and I still love him. I've been bawling my eyes out for days just hoping he would just talk to me, but I know it's over. I could really use some comfort food and I don't have the money to buy anything. I've tried to budget rent and utilities and with just my income, I'll barely have enough for food and gas to get to work. I know I have to get out of this bed, look for a new place and get my head together. Right now, I don't have the will to do anything. I hope someone can treat me to some pizza please. This would mean the world to me. Thank you.
0	I'm 15 weeks pregnant with my very first little munchkin and I am just going *nuts* for anything salty and savory. Unfortunately, my SO and I have committed to making all our food at home with whatever we have on hand (to save up for this baby of ours). None of the ingredients we have include pizza ingredients. But we *do* have an abundance of peanut butter, jelly, and bread which is the exact opposite of what I've been craving. We don't know if it's a girl or a boy yet (we know in 8 days!), but an old wives' tale says that if you're craving sweets it's a girl, but if you're craving salty things it's a boy :)
0	We go on Thanksgiving break Wednesday but the proff decided to have the exam last minute. Going to be up late :s Will return the favor!
0	Hi there. My fiance and I are down on our luck in Las Vegas (and no, not from gambling, lol). I was the only breadwinner, and I got laid off last week. My unemployment money hasn't kicked in yet, and things are getting quite tight. Our fridge is down to that one jar of relish that everybody seems to have, some Taco Bell hot sauce packets, and some jelly, so I was hoping someone would be kind enough to help us out with a hot meal.   If there is a generous soul out there who sends us a pizza, I will certainly pay it forward once things turn around for us. Thanks so much for reading, I really appreciate it!
0	I have been on /r/RandomActsofPizza, and I always liked the idea but I was too scared. Now I would like to try this for real, but I am starting off by requesting a pizza. I am a simple pepperoni type person, but I love trying new things.   This isn't a sob story of any kind, I just want a pizza. If you'd like, I am in the Orange County **~*area*.**  I would love to pay this forward to someone some time. The idea of RAoP is awesome; giving the present of ooey-gooey-pizza goodness is amazing.   I hope to get a Redditor who expands my tastes!   *P.S. I never had anchovies. I love all meats. Cheese? Please! Lots.*
0	(I will write you a poem/haiku about whatever you want for a pizza.)  I got up hungry     Because my roommate is cheap     Pasta is not good      My roommate and I take turns doing the grocery shopping, and this past week he ended up going. He brought back two cases of ramen, a 12 pack, and smokes. The 12 pack he downed himself the first night, his cigs are gone, and we are left with these little nasty packages of ramen. Sad part is, the receipt didn't add up to what I originally gave him. Can someone out there help two friends out with a meal that isn't soggy noodles? If you help us, your haiku will be posted for all to see. We will also supply [pictures](http://i.imgur.com/b0VNB.jpg), as that's just how we roll =)  
0	I'm not gonna bore y'all with some long sob story, but basically it's gonna be a looong loooong time before I can afford a pizza again, and maybe I'm just cynical but I think it's amazing people would be so generous and when I've got a bit of cash I look forward to being able to make someones day.  So if anyone would be so kind to send me a wee pizza over, I would be so thrilled :)  EDIT: Some proof of my skint-ness! http://imgur.com/s5pKxmJ
1	Hi, Me and my room mates could really do with a good pizza meal. 3 of us are still looking for summer jobs (including me :( ) and pizza would be a nice treat to lift our spirits :) Thank you
1	~~~I have no income whatsoever, and my husband is on SSI, paying for my rent and his on a fixed income. With bills and rent, we come out with $8 total for the rest of the month. My food card does not come in till the 9th, and we may not have enough food to last until then. A pizza would greatly lift our spirits, and if someone did donate one, once I have an income again we would be glad to do the same in return. We've already been trolled once today, please don't get our hopes down a second time..~~~  EDIT: Many, MANY thanks to SarTim, it is SO wonderful to know there are kind people in the world. Thank you!
0	3 lads wanting some pizza, will post pictures of us doing things for your amusement in return. we shall be your picture slaves. 
1	Mass., US.  I'm flat out broke until tomorrow with no food in the house for dinner tonight.  My daughter is 2 and we usually do a pizza and movie night every once in a while, and she's been asking about it.  I've got rent and car payment coming up, and bill collectors calling.  I try to not let my wife know exactly how bad we are when it gets like this, but she mentioned we didn't have anything for dinner tonight, and I can't get groceries until tomorrow.  Can anyone help out?  Thanks a billion.
0	Hi all, thanks for taking the time to even look at a request on here.  So the story is I've been unemployed since I got out of the Air Force and doing pretty okay without unemployment benefits. But I've started my new job and its a 20 mile drive both ways and not exactly conducive to my 50 dollar a week income from selling plasma. To top it off, today I was moved to a 8-5 shift and couldn't make it in time to donate due to traffic.  I won't get paid until next Friday, which will be kind of a stretch. Not looking for anything major, just hoping for a nice random act to keep me full until tomorrow afternoon.  And I guess to guilt you guys a bit, my new job is providing network support to literally EVERY Army hospital in the world and keeping their gears turning. To say the least, it is stressful.  But that's that, thought I might try one of these. Thanks for reading :D
0	I am currently unemployed was relocated to this small town and then downsized. Things are tough. There is a Pizza Hut in this small town and if someone was kind enough it would be appreciated.
0	Due to some other expenses we are unfortunately a bit tight on funds!  My partner has recently dealt with some issues with alcoholism.  Not severe to the point where he needed rehab, but severe enough to where he's started strictly moderating his alcohol intake, and has recently joined a support group.   I'd love to reward his hard work with some pizza to celebrate.  He has found an amazing support group for others in his situation, which has been really helpful and encouraging.   We live very close to a Dominoes, Pizza Hut, and Papa Murphys.  I was hoping to score a $15 gift card, it would be enough to get a medium pizza with the works at any of these locations.  Papa murphys has always been his favorite.   I have also recently returned to work after becoming injured, my first paycheck is arriving on the 16th of September.  I definitely plan on paying it forward once I get paid.  We have a decent homeless population in the area and I've been couponing to get some care packages put together (bagged lunch, tooth brush, tooth paste, couple of wash cloths, baby wipes, reusable water bottle, notepad and pen, stuff like this) to give out.  Or I can pay it forward on here, pizza-buyers choice :)  I'll be doing the care packages either way, but I'll have an extra $X to put towards it :P
1	Me and my girlfriend recently moved across the country. Turns out the job I had was a scam, and I never got paid. Tonight is our last night in the hotel room and we are beyond broke. We could really use a pizza while we try to figure out what is next for us. Staying in the Los Angeles area. 
1	Hoping to have an interview soon. However, I'm broke until at least Wednesday hopefully that is. If anyone is kind enough to supply me with pizza I'll certainly give when I can.
0	I am a broke college student. I currently don't have enough money to buy any food. I have been eating very minimal since I can't afford to eat. Any help would be appreciated. 
0	This is such an amazing day!
0	Hey, RAOP. I'm a college student in Seattle, Washington. I just scored a job and am expecting my first paycheck in a little over a week, but as of right now I'm down to a a couple cans of green beans and 3 potatoes, and I need a bit more to tide me over until I can get money for groceries. A friend recommended I try to drop a post here and see how it goes, so here I am. 
0	Hello Redditors,  have you ever received something for free? Did you remember how good that felt, just because "hey, free stuff" ? Well, I hadn't had that feeling in a while and I just want to experience it. I know the power of the internet would blow my wife's mind and my daughter would think I'm a magician. Honestly, it's not about the money, I'll pay the pizza forward to another random redditor or back to yourself(today you, tomorrow me), it's just for science , to know if free pizza really does taste better. 
1	Have enough for a few meals for the next 2 days, but would love to have a nice pizza!
0	im 18 and my birthday is on Thursday 8/25. there wont be a party for me this year.my parents tried to buy me a burger last year but i wouldn't let them but it because we were low on cash.i don't think im making sense anymore.im sorry.Have a wonderful day.
0	College student at Savannah College of Art and Design dying for a pizza New to the whole reddit network but looking for a good first experience!  Savannah, ga
0	So, to keep the sob story short, my paycheck has basically all gone to bills this past week and I won't be getting any money for another two weeks.  I have a box and a half of pasta and some sauce to last me until then, but a pizza would really help.  I know that since I just created a username today most people wouldn't be ready to offer their assistance and that's fine, I understand.  This is sort of a last resort for me anyway.

1	My mother and father's business of 20 years tanked last year and they've been struggling ever since. I live with my mother, and my two younger sisters in house that we can no longer afford to keep. We're moving into my grandparents house next weekend. Apart from my mother's disability checks, I am my immediate family's only source of income. I work part-time and make about 100 bucks a week.       If someone would be kind enough to hook us up with a pizza it would be much appreciated! :)
0	[Pix](http://i.imgur.com/jnMyR.jpg) and I need foodz. She started munching on the paper shortly after this...  Edit: Located near Bonney Lake, WA
0	I just found this subreddit and I'm super pumped. But the problem is the only pizza place in Kent, Ohio that I still know is open closes in 8, now 7 minutes. I didn't eat dinner tonight cause I was planning on ordering food after my last paycheck cleared at midnight, but for some reason it didn't go through and now I have no money to order food. This would be a great help, nay, a miracle if somehow this works out. Thanks a million.  Edit: Just found out Gyro doesn't close until 3! An extra hour on the clock, this would still be awesome!  Edit 2: Only 15 minutes left. I should have expected 2am to be subprime pizza wishing time.   Edit 3: Oh well, I figured this was too good of an idea to actually work. Apparently one of the mods has taken it upon himself to personally cut off any potential pizza supply tonight for who knows what reason, and it's just about 3 so nooo Gyro. Sorry Random Acts of Pizza, I was so ready to pay it forward. 
1	Family of 4 would really love a pizza. 
0	I'm having a really bad day. First off, it was 90 degrees and I was standing at a bus stop trying to get back to campus (I go to the University of Chicago). Suddenly, two guys come up and grab my bag and run off. I spend the next couple of hours with police officers trying to find my bag which has my phone, a dress that I bought for my cousin's wedding, and a ball of yarn. I'm really bummed and would love nothing more than a pizza to end my bad day on a better note. 
0	Hello, Not quite sure how this work, but a buddy told me about this. I am super broke as I've had to make rent and deposit for a new apartment as well as rent for the old place! I will be visiting my local food pantry on Mon, but I'm hungry now. :/
0	A pizza would be fucking awesome.  Between paychecks, GF is out so shes not cooking and a meaty pizza while studying some science would be great.
0	Me and my two teenage boys are hungry. I am out of work, we have no money and we are behind on our rent. I went to a church today and they couldn't help us and we havent eaten since yesterday.I am now at the library typing this. Please help if you can my email is mayonaise12@inbox.com.
0	My mom is Broke until Oct and I'm 15 and have no job. We have nothing in the fridge/freezer. Both of her bank accounts are negative (If you want proof I will happily provide, of course some things will be blurred out) All we want really is a Pizza. In the past when I tried to order they don't deliver where we live. (In the mountains) so we could always go and pick up.   Thanks for reading.
1	Been subsisting on friends generosity and a bag of rice and beans that is shrinking quickly. Hoping someone might be able to help me out. The last three days have been tapatio/rice/beans, twice a day and I feel like I'm starting to lose my mind!
0	Longer version of the story. I got engaged a few weeks ago and my fiancÃ© wanted to visit her mother in buffalo. I let her use my car and she wrecked it. I should have got it back by Monday. Now it could be Friday. I never had rental on my insurance because I never used it. Took the rental back Friday to save money since I was supposed to get the car back Monday. So here I am. No cash on me. I used my last bank check Sunday. Lost my debit card. And the bank is several hours walking distance from me. I really want a hot pizza to improve my mood :( luckily I am not superstitious and taking it as a sign that this marriage is a bad idea because we have so much fun together. Enough about me for now. Let's talk pizza! And yes I would love to pay this back forward one I have transportation again! Thanks!
1	Well, this is my first time on RAoP. So I figured I'd try it out. I'm home sick today, don't have my license (thank you bureaucracy), with a beat up leg (http://i.imgur.com/jrQCk.jpg), broke (http://i.imgur.com/DNEEd.jpg ) (The irony is the picture of the contents of my wallet has 'need' in the URL). Anyways, if someone could get me some pizza before 5 today, I would love you forever. Anyways, thanks in advance. P.S. Just whacked my head getting up to get my iphone to take some proof pics. Anyways :P
0	Hey! We've been packing all day and me and my man are getting hungry. I would just order something, but I don't get paid till next week. We'd love some pizza and I promise to pay it forward when I get some money!
1	I'm a college student who's a bit tight on cash right now. Any extra money I have is going towards my projects for my major, so I don't have much to eat and I'm craving a pizza.  FYI, there's no Papa John's in my town - only Domino's, Pizza Hut, and a couple local places - just to keep in mind if anyone is kind enough to make an offer.
1	I'm on my last dollar until they pay. Which completely blows. I'm a college student who has been going through a rough patch this year and a pizza would be nice.. :)  Thanks! 
0	I'm a (currently diamond) Challenger 3v3 League of legends player and top 100 in Scrolls. Unfortunately being good at those games doesn't stop me from being hungry, I'm willing to add you on Skype and work with you to improve your game and in exchange we get to be pizza buddies...snacking and playing together.
0	I just spent all my money on rent and I'm real hungry. There's a pizza place nearby that has real good pepperoni pizza. It sounds really good right now. 
0	Hey everybody, I've read through a lot of these requests, and there are a lot of people much worse off than I, so if it comes down to it, I hope they get help first. That being said, I would be extremely grateful if someone would be willing to help me out. Like I said, I don't have a sob story, no little children's mouth's to feed, but I'm kind of stuck in a rut in life, and I think pizza might cheer me up. I couldn't tell you the last time I didn't have a meal that wasn't prepared out of a plastic bowl or metal cup. If someone had it in their heart, and wanted to help me out, I would be forever grateful.  Thanks.
1	I lost my debit card last night and don't currently have a vehicle to go get a new one... so I have no money until tomorrow at least. Anyone want to help me out with a pizza? 
1	My bday is next tuesday and I was hoping one of you guys/girls would buy me a pizza from pizza hut or dominos today being the only places in the area. Im tired of ramen and processed ham. I understand many people have less but today I'd like to eat and be satisfied for the first time in a while. When Im in position to return the favor to random acts of pizza I surely will. Just today I'd like a break. Also, if it interests you I'm entering a program to get my associates degree in welding for two years where I will be living and getting an allowance to learn and pull myself from a negative environment. So contributing back wont take long. Thank you redditers.
0	So, this Christmas, I am living in my car. I will pick up my ten year old daughter from her dad's and go to Starbuck's in our pajamas as per our tradition, and the rest of Christmas is going to be shit.   I worked in my friend's yarn shop today, and am closing up and starving and broke. When I leave here, I will drive to the rest area up the interstate and work on the commission knitting project I have.   Everything right now sucks, so I thought I'd give this a shot. It'd really make my night.
0	Hello, me and my white best friend are sitting here dreaming about the scrumptiousness of melted cheese amongst risen bread. My friend and me are dreaming of little animals being murdered to be the topping upon our delicious oasis.  Okay, two broke seniors hanging out empty house, no food, no parents to give food. And we just got done mowing two senior citizens' lawns if it makes any difference. Thanks for the help

0	... do you guys deliver to Afghanistan because the little pizzas at the chow hall suck.
0	Hey guys,  It's been a shitty day at work, we don't even have enough money to buy paper towels, my cat is sick and I just give up on today. I'd really appreciate it if someone could buy me and my boyfriend dinner. I give up on today.
0	Hey whats up everyone. my name is John and ive been in dcf since i was three. i am now 18 and attending a community college here in New Haven ,CT and since i am 18 i finally get my own place that im very thankful DCF helps pay for. the only thing is that IM HUNGRY. my case worker is suppose to give me money for food. but she has yet to come and i havent heard from her in the past few days. i pizza would be awesome at this point. so if anyone could help please let me know. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE! HAVE A AWESOME DAY AND HAPPY 4TH OF JULY.
0	I'm broke till next Friday, but I'm in such a need of a pizza right now!  No sob story here; I have food at my apartment, but I don't think any of it is gonna hit the spot like a nice slice right about now.  And I really want something to help with hangover right now.  If this works I plan on paying forward Friday.  If you wanted to determine the criteria for the pizza I give away I would be game for that!
0	Two of my room mates are changing jobs and myself and my other room mate are on fortnightly pay and don't get paid till next Tuesday. Could eat a mountain of food right now. Thanks guys
1	I don't get my check from work until Friday. My son is 8, and a pizza would fill us up today and lunch tomorrow until my mom can loan me some money. My brother just told me about this site. I hope someone could help us out. I'm also stuck at home with no car. I hope this works because it would mean a lot to my son Tyler. 
1	I've been out of work as I try and get some medical issues taken care of. Fighting with both my old employer and the government, jumping through hoops, etc. Can't complain for the most part, managing to just barely make rent in my basement bachelor apartment, etc. but no budget left for finer things in life like pizza. Been a long time since I had one, hoping to recapture the flavour. :)
0	Hey guys.  This is my first request.  I live in Pittsburgh and my boyfriend's visiting for a week.  I haven't seen him since the beginning of May so I'm pretty excited, but here's the situation.  My boyfriend doesn't have a job (I do, but I get paid by the month and my first paycheck isn't coming until June 30th).  The only reason he can visit me now is because his brother is taking summer classes so that's half of the traveling cost paid.  He also sprained his ankle on Saturday meaning he's still in crutches.  Lastly (and I realize this one's mostly my fault), my mother really wants us to go with her to Lake Erie for a day and a half.    [Following paragraph contains a lot of venting about crazy Polish mothers]  Now you may be wondering "What's wrong with the last part" in which I will refer you to the crutches.  Yes, I've explained to her about the crutches, that he can't and shouldn't walk very much and that he is not going to be comfortable on this trip.  I've even suggested other alternatives, like going to a free movie in the park.  The thing is, my mother is crazy and you can't argue with crazy.  Also, I'm going to have to tell my BF that apparently, he has to go because if he doesn't, I'm going to be the one getting bitched at about how my boyfriend doesn't care about me and how he's lazy.  I know I should just shake it off and deal with it but honestly, I can't change my situation RIGHT NOW so I'd prefer dealing with this as painlessly as possible.  Of course, my boyfriend seemed pretty pissed about it when I told him my mom suggested this idea so, thanks mom, you're probably going to be the cause of our first fight.  Anyway, it's gonna be a terrible few days for him and I'd like to make sure he has a tasty meal after a long trip and to say "I'm sorry that my mom's crazy and I can't do anything about it."  His house is in Oakland so I'd suggest Sorento (4126219129 cheap and decent quality) or Antoons (4126875446 cheaper but more meh pizza) since they are local and cheap.  Also, since I'm getting my first paycheck in June 30th, I'll make sure to donate a pizza.   
0	Going through a pretty rough time right now, (check out my post history if you would like its a long story). And my 3 year old has been asking for pizza for about a week now. If someone could help him out I would be really grateful. Any pizza place would be great we aren't picky.
1	I have a 6 year old who broke his leg today, he is very sad because he cannot go outside and climb. My wife and I have no money to eat out because we had to pay for his medical expenses, bills, and food this week. Please help me put a smile on his face tonight.

0	Cash and food supplies are very low right now. We would appreciate some help with a pizza dinner. We will pay it forward when we can. Thanks if you can help.
0	Short version. We are a family of 5. 2 adults. 3 kids. Ages 11-9-3 My husband lost his job and we are worn out and stressed. We have food, we are not poor. We would just like some Pizza to help cheer up the family and give mommy and daddy a break from cooking ! Mainly our toddler who LOVES PIZZA. ! we promise to pay it forward when we get the cash! We have a papa johns close by, that has to be carryout, the refuse to deliver to APT COMPLEX. Promise to upload a pic or 2 enjoying the pizza.  if we could we'd appreciate two lg peps, but whatever we can get. We'll be grateful  THANKS FROM Midwest City, Ok
0	I can totally give proof of the broken hand! Was looking for a job when I broke my hand in October and haven't been able to work since. Currently have a plate in my hand, can't work, and medical bills are piling up. And to top it all off, I'm starving! Never tried this before and just seeing if someone cares to give a pie!
0	Hey everyone! I couldn't access my other account, but anyway  - I lost access to my bank funds and will not be able to purchase anything until payday (this Friday) - I've got 3 tests this week and I work roughly 30-35 hours a week... I typically eat about a meal a day (no fast food, just home cooked) - I have some rice, beans and some ground beef in the fridge that I attempted to cook... But this was the [result](http://imgur.com/X3wwk). Burnt like hell. Tastes worse than it smells.  Nothing too serious, just a series of first world problems. I'd really appreciate any help! I'll be sure to return the favor this Friday.  Thanks!  Edit: Also, I'm in Denton, TX.
0	I work as a valet and normally get the majority of my money in cash tips.  Just moved to a new state and they don't have my bank and so I haven't been able to deposit my pay checks until tomorrow when I work again and get tip money for food.  If you feed me I will dedicate the rest of my afternoon to something productive, also known as rereading Mario Puzo's classic 1969 American Crime Masterpiece, The Godfather.
0	This week has been terrible, I lost a family friend to a car crash and my kitty (age 15)died on Christmas. I've done nothing but cry and post/read rage comics to try and keep my spirits up. I could really use some reddit love right now. I'm in Gatineau,QC (Aylmer)(near Ottawa)
0	Recently my basement apartment was completely flooded. It took all my sheets and towels to dry the place out. So I spent the day and, what to me, is a fortune at the coin laundry. So there was no money for groceries. Today I finished off the last food, and my monthly stipend does not arrive until the day after tomorrow. I could really use a pizza.
0	I am the mom of 4 children and the wife of a wonderful husband.  Some background info: my husband was in an auto accident on 8/14 and when he was finally able to return to work 9/7, he was told there is not enough work for him and that he should look for a new job.  THIS after he was working 55-60 hours a week before the accident (he was a passenger).  We went through our savings during his time out and have overdrawn our Netspend account over $90.  Our family has been living off of boxed mashed potatoes and the cheap boxed mac and cheese.  I have used the food bank already this month and I am waiting on DSS to approve my food stamp app.  I am trying to do everything right. It is 4:55 and every kid (ages 15, 13, 13 and 7) has all been asking about dinner.  They know their dad lost his job but they don't know about our financial situation of not only being broke but being negative in the bank.   I am not worried about myself or my husband eating.  I would just really like for my children to have a filling dinner.  We have no bread, no milk, no meat.  Just one cheese and one pepperoni pizza would mean more to my family than I can express.  I know we will be back on our feet within a month.  I have faith in that.  I am a strong believer in paying it forward.  Any info or verification you need, please don't hesitate to ask.  I do have a verification code if someone is willing to help. Thank you for taking the time to read and consider my request.  This is very humbling but I want to put my pride away in hopes of my family having a filling meal tonight.
1	Money is incredibly tight right now as I just sent my son to Walt Disney World with his high school marching band for spring break (right around $1400).  Judging from the last surgery I had on my gastrointestinal system, it will be at least 10-12 months before I will be able to enjoy pizza without a fair amount of discomfort.  I might even come out of this totally lactose intolerant, which, holy Horatio Cain, would be a terrible, terrible blow.    I'd like to spend my last evening with solid food for the forseeable future the way anytrue blue redditor would: on the couch, consuming pizza while watching Archer and Lost on Netflix.  
0	My friend and I's flight was canceled, and then delayed we're stuck here intill 7:30 PM and won't get to our final destination till 10. We've been here since 8:00AM. The airport is super tiny, there isn't any place to grab food. A pizza would be super clutch right now!   our flight has been delayed again, and we're still hungry, please! edit: pics for proof http://imgur.com/a/hCcaq
0	I live in a small town that just doesn't have a Papa Johns. I have a code for a free PJ Large 1 topping, was hoping to trade since the nearest one is 30 min from me. Thanks to you guys and your subreddit.
1	I was trying to come up with a drinking game with the little bit of whiskey I have left for this Oscar night.  I suddenly thought, "Self, a glorious cheese pizza would be a wonderful pairing with impending drunkenness."  Sadly, I have no pizza but I have such an intense craving now.  Hence the [pic](http://i.imgur.com/4p3aA.jpg).   So please RAOPers, may I have a pie?  I would greatly appreciate (unf) a pie gifted this way.
0	Hey RAOP, we're not starving, but we're strapped this month and we've eaten chicken every way we can think of for almost three weeks straight, trying to stretch the dollars to the max. My niece, nephew and sister have a hankerin for some Dominoes tonight. I'd be grateful for a couple of pies for dinner tonight.
0	I am 19 and recently became homeless, I just got out of the hospital to find out that my medical card had been canceled and I cannot pay for mine. Also, my boyfriend was in the hospital a few days prior and has a T12 L4 fracture in his spine. We have been staying at a friends house for a little bit but they are low on food and we have been eating ramen and cheese sandwiches for the past week. I would like to treat him to a pizza, but I have no money at all. I do have proof I need help with my (and my boyfriend's) prescription and our hospital bands.  
1	I only get paid once a month and I spent the last of it taking care of my recently acquired rescue who isn't feeling well. Pizza would just make this day better, been up since 5am taking care of a sic puppy.
1	Just your average broke college student looking for some pizza lovin'. I only have 5 weeks before school is over but I'm not doing so hot financially. Hopefully I'll get to work two jobs over the summer. I vow to pay it forward if I do receive some pizza.  I'm currently working on mock-ups for a project. (design student)  -8245a
0	I'm severely craving a: London  Garden City Fungus shiitake, portobello, crimini, button and oyster mushroom roasted with fresh rosemary on white. Add our housemade Italian sausage 2 / 3  From: Bridge Pizza in Missoula, MT  http://www.yelp.com/biz/bridge-pizza-missoula  http://www.bridgepizza.com/downloads/BridgePizza-Menu.pdf  I'm very much unemployed. I received a letter stating that my unemployment benefits are on hold until I explain why I didn't register with the job service. Of course, I immediately verified that I am in fact registered. Thanks to some glitch in their system I didn't get my unemployment check this week. I'm not starving by any means but I would really love a pizza right now.  How amazing is this pizza, you ask? See for yourself:  http://imgur.com/plKF4rm,jfCyNb7  I will pay it forward: once I manage to find a job.
0	No sob story, pizza just sounds delicious for dinner.
1	i couldnt afford to take the gf out for our 9 yr anniversary.. been applying to jobs round the clock but nobody is hiring out here. i'd really appreciate it if somebody could throw me a giftcard or something, otherwise it's ramen again for dinner. (and we're running low on that, too)  either way, thanks to y'all for being so awesome and helping out others. this subreddit warms my heart.  (north hollywood, CA)
1	Wanted: One hot, greasy, cheesy, delicious pie to abate the munchies and nurture our young, brilliant minds while we explore the frontiers of modern medicine in our quest to conquer the "Anatomy II Midterm Examination". Will offer deepest gratitude and mad props in return. Mahalo. 
0	I don't like asking for hand outs, honestly, but some Pizza for my boyfriend and I would be fantastic and beyond appreciated!
0	Leaving for a flight early tomorrow (I can show you my online boarding pass) Needless to say flying makes me a little jittery and pizza is a big comfort food for me, would probably help me sleep.  I also have a confirmation code thingy if you want to see it.  Many thanks pizza givers!
1	Title pretty much says it all, would love a pizza to share amongst my roommates while we study!
1	Hello all. Having been laid off in March, the last few months have been lean for my partner and I, but I finally got a job today! I don't start until September so there are still plenty more nights of pasta and pulses, I just wondered if someone might be able to put a cheese-topping on what has been a long awaited good day and let us go to bed tonight fat and happy on Pizza? I'll pay it forward with my first paycheque and be eternally grateful. Many thanks to all of those wonderful people who make this subreddit a garden of kindness and hope. 
1	I have been homeless before and never asked for help in such ways.  I am working, but job only pays once a month.  I have been broke for 16 days, was supposed to be payed Friday.  Been all weekend without food.  I can see my money in bank but cannot touch it until tomorrow.  I will re-gift someone else in return or refund money.
0	My flatmate and I are both doing secondary degrees and have assignments due tomorrow. We're also a bit short of cash. In fact she has several things due, thanks to outside circumstances, and is rather suffering so she could definitely do with a little cheering up. Me? I just like pizza and could really do with the extra motivation. Thanks for reading :) 
0	I want a 'zza somethin' awful, and this craving's reaching a critical level. We're talking about an urgency never before felt by human- or (ninja) turtlekind. Please help me in my quest for gooey cheese and tasty toppings!
0	My friend has helped me with a place to stay and food until I get on my feet and she is having a difficult time herself as a single mother of 1. She didn't need to help me out but after my daughter had open heart surgery I lost everything and after being homeless and hungry for the last 8 months her helping me recently is helping me get my whole life back on track.  She doesn't have much but still is giving and got me out of the homeless shelter!  We do have food so if there's anyone going without please help them.  If there's more to go around we sure could use it and I know her and her son would be very grateful!  Thanks!
0	AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!  [VA area, serious offers only please]
0	Hi RAOP redditors,  I recently moved up to Kirkland, WA, and due to less than happy circumstances had to move my wife up when our finances were less than ideal in order to get her out of them. While the hope was to move her up when our finances were more stable, it just didn't pan out that way.  The good news is that it meant I got to be with her sooner. The bad news is that it's meant having no money for much food at all - in fact, we ran out of food this evening. We're waiting on some sales on craigslist to get through and see us through the weekend, but it doesn't look like those will happen tonight.  I would be deeply grateful if the pizza fairy made its visit tonight, and so here is my story. Thank you.
0	My dad passed away on July 11th and I've been supporting my mom since her income was based on him. She was his caregiver. I've managed all of her financial issues lately, because she has a hard time asking others for help, so I've done everything from collecting donations on gofundme for the cremation costs and asking family and friends for money for her living costs for her. It has been exhausting. Plus she lives a few hours away so I've been shelling out so much in gas.  Meanwhile I started a new job and training hours were slim this past couple weeks. I also go to school; just an online class this summer, but normally full time. I'm not usually so broke, but this past month or so has been really rough. My wife and I would adore a pizza during this time! I would also be happy to come back and fund a pizza for someone else.   Thanks for reading!
0	One day at a time, starting to climb out of some dark times. Would love a pizza to anywhere, if anyone can help I'll absolutely pay it back or forward next week!  Thanks!
0	reposted to follow posting guidelines  I was invited but we have one car and it doesn't fit everyone and im always left out. but i could always go for my own pizza at home! thanks for reading let me know if i did anythign wrong guys
0	I'm sure I can talk the hospital into making me only pay a fraction of the cost, but it's a bit of a downer as it still will wind up being at least a 1/10th of what I make a year.  Anyway, if someone is up for tossing me a bit of a pick me u I'm in Elkhart, IN and I'd be very appreciative. Otherwise, I have cans of soup and some saltines.  (Not sure if I have to post proof or something. I'll see if I can get my scanner to work in the mean time)  edit: Page one of 3 from my insurance denying my claims.  http://imgur.com/TxnX2
0	If you help me out, I promise to pay it forward when I get the chance! Thank you  EDIT: My friends came and got me! Enjoying Taco Bell. No need for Pizza today, I guess, but I'm sure I'll be back another day, perhaps with gifts!
0	I have a 5 month old baby boy that is being a stage 5 clinger today so no cooking is getting done. A pizza would be pretty helpful but it's not in the budget. I have a verification code. Thanks! 
0	Recently got laid off from my job. Only have hot dogs in the house and no money coming in for 2 days... Kindness and a pizza would really brighten my day.  Will pay it forward as soon as I can.  EDIT: /u/roxieh tried but being from the UK caused some issues... any US redditors out there with a heart of gold?  UPDATE: would still really appreciate a pizza :)
0	Edit: never mind - managed to find some spare change and buy a packet of dried spaghetti from the local corner shop.  Don't really have much to say apart from the above. It's 8:15pm in London and I literally haven't eaten anything all day. I have a jar of mustard in the fridge and that's it.  My flatmates are on holiday, and my friends and family are all far away. If anyone can gift me a pizza it'll make a huge difference. I'll have a couple of slices now and the rest should tide me over for tomorrow. I have some money from contract work hopefully (*fingers crossed*) coming in next week.  Thanks for reading, even if you don't send me a pizza. It feels good to share.  Edit: My brother gave me a Steam code for Bastion a couple of months ago. I haven't used it yet and I'll happily trade it for a pizza.
0	My mother is a nurse, and has been working the night shift at work for the past few days, and hasn't gotten paid yet. Child support hasn't come in either. All us kids have been eating the past couple of days are crackers and dry cereal, and lightly with them. Not trying to sound like a sob story, but some pizza would really lighten our spirits. Thanks! Edit: Already getting helped out, thanks PhysicsGirl!
0	So me and my friend are stuck in our dorm while our friends are at a party that both of our ex gf's are also at. We're hoping our friend's didn't invite us cause of that reason. Either way, we're feelin a bit down, as well as sober, broke, and hungry. If any friendly Redditor would like to help us out a bit, we'll definitely return the favor to another hungry Redditor down the road. Thanks Reddit :)
0	I am stuck staying with my parents for a couple weeks in one of the most backwoods, behind the times, boring places ever.  There is nothing for a girl like me to do around here, and [this](http://untitled38057.tumblr.com/post/27547768540/ladelthia) is me. I don't quite fit in down here. It is very .... country here. The one redeeming factor is that they do have a few pizza places here. We have Dominos, Pizza Hut, and Papa Johns! I have literally been eating the same three meals every day for the last two weeks. I eat cereal for breakfast, a bologna sandwich for lunch and ramen for dinner. I could REALLY go for a nice pizza to wake my taste buds up from this coma. If you guys could help me out with this, I would greatly appreciate it! I will even take pictures of me eating that delicious pizza and post them for you guys to see! Please and thank you?  
0	Hey, everyone. I've been having a tough time lately. My bank account is pretty low, I can screenshot it if needed. The paycheck from the job I had to leave is late showing up in the mail. I'm a lot more fortunate than some people here, but I'm stuck in this spot right now. I would be so so so thankful if someone from this amazing community could help out. Pizza is great.
0	There isn't anything to eat in my house, and I do mean that. Furthermore I dont have a car or any money to order food, and I have been hungry for hours now. If anyone could find it in their heart to send me a pizza at this time or night, or heck even tomorrow morning i'd be grateful.  Also, I'd draw anything you want to the best of my ability in ms paint.  Im near Toronto, Ontario.
0	Nothing special here really, Poked my head into RAoP when it first started thought its a pretty cool idea.  There ARE other redditors who NEED such a service more than myself, but hey, its free pizza right? =p  If anyone is in the mood for giving feel free to drop me a PM, I live in a rural town with no large pizza franchises, so I'm not sure how that would even work &gt;_&lt;  Cheers all!
0	I just moved in to my new place (loving it!) last night. I'm in a bit of a bind since I was previously living in a mix of hotels/couches, and don't have anything to cook with, just my clothing and a few other necessities for now. All the money I had saved up went to my rent and security deposit. I get paid on Monday but until then the food situation is looking a bit grim. I send my thanks in advance to anyone who'd like to help me get through the next day with the cheesy goodness of pizza!
0	Wife and newborn are out of town for the night at relatives and I'm home alone. I have some tuna of hers here I could honestly make but I'd rather have a pizza.   Thanks for taking a look :)
0	I have not one item of groceries in my house until I get paid this week and I'm pretty darn hungry.  If someone would be willing to help out it'd really make my day, thanks for any consideration.
0	spent all my money on a ring and in need of food   I'm from the UK  (also this is my chance to prove reddit is a good place to her)  Edit: if I do receive a pizza I will give one away once I'm paid
1	My dad has helped me out of so many binds that it's not even funny, so when my car broke down I decided it was time for me to try to handle things on my own. At first it was the inner and outer tie rod, then I had a problem with the fan switch, and now it won't even start. I was trying to do things on my own so my dad would be proud of me for fixing things but I've just managed to screw it all up.   To make a long story short, I have a full tank of gas and I've spent $650 in two weeks trying to get my car running, but it isn't working. I just bought a bus pass to get to work, so I have $3 to my name until Wednesday rolls around, and an empty pantry to keep me company. If a kind stranger was to provide me with a pie, I'll be more than happy to pay back the hungry with my next paycheck.   EDIT: I'm in Columbus, OH  EDIT 2: The pizza arrived! Thanks raavyn! [It was delicious!](http://www.imgur.com/Lkwsk.jpg) Thank you so much! Look forward to helping someone else out!
0	There's no getting around how few jobs require Kant and Nietzsche. Can I get a little help?
0	In case there is anyone out there who is feeling generous towards a Canuck.
1	Just another college student going through exams, a nice meaty pizza would make my day.  Whatever I may receive I will pay forward a pizza of at least equal awesomeness to somebody else when I have the means to do so.
0	Hello Reddit,                  My family is small consisting of my son, my wife, and me. I was on unemployment for being laid off around a year ago but I stopped receiving it about two months now. Ive been looking for a job but since gas prices are so high money has been tight. My wife has been angry with me for not being able to find a job but I'm trying my best its just hard these days. A friend at church told me about this site so i figured id give it a try. If any one can help us out you would make my wife and son so happy. Thank you God bless. 
0	My friend is helping me out by housing while i find a place of my own, but he's out of town and doesn't have any food in his place, and he's out for the weekend.  If anyone could help me feed myself this weekend I would be happy to pay it forward when I'm on my feet, thanks!
0	A little about me: I am in a supportive living program for chemical dependency after completing a rigorous in-patient detox program. Myself and three other guys share an apartment and we get all of our food from the facilities 'food pantry.' We aren't starving but I know I haven't enjoyed the tasty goodness of a pizza in over 41 days! One of the other guys has been deprived for nearly 90 days! I will do whatever is necessary to substantiate my story if need be. Thanks for taking the time to check this out.
0	I really want pizza, but the only offer I have is a 48 hour all access pass to Crunchyroll. I have 3 that are unused.   Plus, OSU (OHio State) is playing today and Pizza would be the prefect compliment to watching them beat Florida.
0	Hi RAOP - I just came across this subreddit and think it's a great idea! Just throwing out this request. Been ill for the last couple of days and managed to have a big fight with my dad yesterday, just feeling a bit rough. Would be nice to curl up with a pizza and put a film on and ignore the world for a bit this evening.
0	im hungry and tired and im locked out fro  my house for three more hours. I just got home and im locked out due to my brother being gine to school. 
0	i spent the weeks pay on a engagement ring for my fiancee and would love to treat her to dinner after my proposal. am willing to pay back on my next paycheck. can someone please make our magical night perfect.
1	So I'm one of those people brought here by the recent media coverage.  I'm sorry if that makes me an outsider.  I've spent the last few days just reading through this site.  Both the pizza end of things and other areas.  I had no idea about reddit.  This Random Acts of Pizza is truly amazing to follow.  You laugh at the guy who's just bored and wants someone to send him a pizza, and you feel for the people that a pizza would be more than a pizza.  I've been hesitant to post because while I'm in a tough spot, it lacks in comparison to so many others.  I finally decided I'd just give it a try.  Worse case scenario, I don't get a pizza.  That's where I am anyway :)  I've been married for almost 10 years.  My wife and I have two beautiful children, a daughter 5, and a son 6.  When I met my wife, I was working crazy hours and didn't always have time for everything we wanted, but Friday night was always our date night.  It started purely by accident when she invited me over for pizza and a movie one night, and we've kept the tradition alive all these years.  We used to go out to the movies, and when that got too expensive, we enjoyed a movie at home.  When the kids got older, date night was expanded to family night.  Pizza and a movie for everyone.  We've gone through a lot of things in the last few years.  It's often felt like one step forward and two steps back.  We're still moving though.  Still fighting.  There came a point where pizza became a luxury, and it's something we've accepted and moved on.  I laugh when people talk about discretionary income.  We've learned to shave a lot of corners and given up a lot of things just to pay the bills.    Anyway, I guess my request is this.  I would love to, just for one night, be able to surprise the family with our pizza tradition.  They deserve it, and I wish I could give it to them.  I'm sure above me and below me are probably posts of people that need it more than we do, and I say give it to them.  If someone knows what it's like to be in this place and wants to help out, it would be much appreciated.  I look forward to the day I can come on here and make someone's day.  No promises of when I'll be able to do that, but I can promise it will happen, and I will be spreading the word about this and hope that more people will offer help to those who need it.  Thanks for listening, and sorry for the long post.  
0	Heyo-  It pains me to write this, on a non-throwaway, no less. I'm really struggling with money right now. I spent Christmas alone (I just moved here and all of my family/friends are 1400 miles away) and am now spending New Year's Eve alone because I can't afford to go out (and... I know no one).   Here's some proof that I am... uh... I guess, a person named Hamburglary? http://imgur.com/efW2d  If you would send a pizza my way for supper I would be FOREVER IN YOUR DEBT. We have a Pizza Butt local to here and that would be juuuust fine (and you can order online etc so that I never need to know your cc info, etc, so on, so forth).   Thanks for reading/thinking about it, and have a great New Year's Eve!
0	So, basically, I am a college student back from spring break.  I had my entire wallet stolen, so I have no credit or debit cards or any cash on hand to buy food.  Nothing in the fridge either. If anyone could help me out, I would happily pizza it foward when my cards come in the mail. Thanks Reddit!
0	Since my family is downsizing, we have to give away our dogs of 9 and 10 years. I think some RAOP would cheer us up.
1	The kids I watch got signed up for summer camp last minute, so all of my working hours are gone. I'm waiting at home now for a few phone calls about jobs, but it's not looking great for being able to eat much more than rice and beans or pasta until the 15th, so a pizza sounds super fantastic, especially after seeing [this](http://redd.it/1fc8e4). It's my first post here, sorry if anything is amiss, thanks for reading!   Edit: I won a contest and got pizza'd! Thanks for being awesome, I'll be sure to pass it on. :D
0	As the title says, Broke. In college. And Hungry. I need to change it up from the dining hall. I would be grateful and once I can, will pass it down!thanks =D
1	Hi everyone! I'm a physics grad student with a 6 year old daughter who want some pizza. We live in Albany, CA (next to Berkeley). We don't have any money because my soon-to-be ex-wife (daughter's mother) is sick (multiple sclerosis) and can't work. Bank of America stopped paying her disability pay back in January and my research stipend isn't even enough to cover our rent. So my choices are top ramen, peanut butter and jelly *again*, or a random act of pizza.   Her mom is busy being fed at restaurants by her new boyfriend while we're here in the apartment struggling to get by. So some pizza would really hit the spot right about now.  Your kindness will be greatly appreciated.
0	Any type would be appriciated im not picky whatsoever thanks
1	Hi there! My name is Jill, I'm a college junior living in Maine for the summer with my three sorority sisters. We are currently flat broke until payday on Saturday (well, Friday at midnight) and have a depressingly empty fridge to match our depressingly empty bank accounts. A night off from scrounging up what little is left of the food in our apartment would be nice! :)  We would really, really appreciate if someone could help us out in the pizza department. We have already decided to return the favor come the weekend. Thank you so much if you can throw us a bone (er, pizza) and we hope you all have a good evening!
1	I just had to pay almost $700 bucks to get my car fixed (Blown hoses, clogged fuel injector, and new spark plug wires) That was all of my grocery money, plus all of my savings until I get paid next week. If someone could help me out, you have my word I would pay it forward 3 fold. 
0	[Pizza received]  Believe it or not, my *parents* bailed on me for dinner tonight! Remarkable! And I don't get my refund from school until late April, but willing to repay the favor then. :)  I'd love to wash down my sorrows with a cheese pizza!  edit: A friend of mine IRL has seen his post and is sending me a pizza. Thank y'all!
0	Hungover, penniless, and I found out my gf was cheating on me.  Don't mean to beg, but I could really use a pizza.
0	My father is a Long haul truck driver and just lost his job, and he is stuck in Maryland. Im here in california with no food, just ran out of flour that I was making "buiscuts" ie. Water + flour. help me out please, and I will help someone else when the cash comes in. Just turned 18, and yes, I've been looking for a JOB! Ive been lurking reddit for a very long time. I feel kind of bad that this is the reason I finally joined.
0	got a 54/100 on my first Test, im feeling down.
1	My SO is the only one working right since I'm still looking for work. He has spent all of the money on bills and the hell hole apartment and now we are both sitting around trying to figure out what to do for food. We have tried to find people on Craigslist to buy our backwards compatible hacked PS3 but the only replies we got were from scams. In short, a pizza sounds so good right now and it sure can raise our hope and morale too. Please Reddit, a pizza pie for two hungry people?   **Edit!** Thanks to mkeanon my Sunday is looking better.
0	Hi everybody. First off, i know this is a new account, but i can provide proof of who I am and my situation. I have been a lurked for a while and even been to a meet-up! I have two little girls and live in an apartment with them. Times have been tough lately with bills and expenses. If somebody would be willing to help us out, we would greatly appreciate it. 
0	All you have is my word, for what its worth from a stranger on the internet but I have a guaranteed free pizza coupon code this sunday and am willing to send it to you in exchange. We would really appreciate a pizza or any food for that matter.
1	Would be nice to surprise the girl friend with pizza AND a ring! Currently located in Ontario, Canada!
0	Have today off, soo I'll be stuck in the house all day cleaning and doing homework that I've put off for a week... Just looking for a pizza pie for lunch! :)   EDIT: Welp, got hungry and finished my homework, so I ordered Jimmy Johns instead, maybe next time! :) 
1	Mommy's at work so me and my son are stuck hanging around the house watching DVD's tonight. we're pretty low on food till Thursday. Save us from going three nights in a row of Mac N Cheese!  (halfway through season 1 of Big Love, then were going to watch some Mad Men)
0	Tourist season is over so my band has no more gigs and I have no more money.  All I've got in my fridge is condiments and I'm basically dirt broke.  I've applied for 3 jobs already but haven't heard anything back.  A pizza would be greatly appreciated and brighten my day.  
0	I would love to eat a pizza, have not eat one in ages.  is there anything i can do to obtain one?   also i am a master in MS paint, and could draw anything you would like!
0	There are 70 brand new teachers coming for training on Monday (06/24). Some of them are buying their own dinner (yay!) but some of them flew or drove all across the country to meet in Middletown to start training.   I'm a helper-outer-person for the non-profit training all these cool people, and I did the same thing last year (showing up to CT from 350 miles away) with zero dollars in my bank account. I don't want these people to have to worry about dinner on Monday.   Something like a Big Y pizza would be best because it's the cheapest way to feed a large group. Anything helps, though! 
0	I am an up-and-coming sci-fi and comic book writer who is chronically short on funds and pizza. I also have a fiance' and two kids living with me. For your generous donation of pizza, I will send you either MS Word .doc or Adobe PDFs of two (count them!), TWO short stories of mine. I will also select a high-quality scan of a classic comic book from my collection and share that with you (I'll try to come up with a short list from which you can pick).
1	The pilot, my partner, and I had to make a quick landing after one of our sensors started acting up. Luckily we didn't have a patient with us. We're grounded at a small airport and were about to order some pizza. Thought I'd see if a random pizza flew our way. Thanks. 
0	Today my friends are helping my mom and I to a new house. I would love to get them some pizza for their hard work later today.
1	Hey guys! I've been craving pizza lately, and have enough money to buy for myself but I figured in the spirit of RAOP, I need to give back. So here's the idea I'd like to pitch:  I'm willing to send cookies (of your choice!! although I've been keen on making some bacon choco chip ones lately) to the sender of my pizza, and another random person (or maybe 2. or 3. probably from [/r/RandomActs Of Cookies](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfCookies/)). I've also got some ideas on how to send cupcakes that I'd like to try as well. I'm a pretty damn good baker so I hope this attempt of "paying it forward" is sufficient.  I should also mention I'm in B.C., but willing to ship anywhere! 
0	Tons of people wish they could come and support this effort but can't because of work or location, but it's incredibly easy to google a pizza place that will deliver to the protesters!  For Boston... Send the pizza(s) to Dewey Square (Boston financial district, right outside South Station).  The logistics team or general donations can be dropped off along the John Fitzgerald prkway by the trees.
1	Hey guys, I just got back from the vet after my kitten had an accident, poor guy broke his paw. I don't earn much and scrap by every week with my food budget and the veterinarian bill really set me back this week. If someone here could help me out it would really put my mind at ease. Thanks for reading, here's a pic of the little [guy](http://imgur.com/nzE6x)  Made a thank you thread [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/vet5r/thanks_the_jury_is_out_for_being_an_awesome_person/) :)
0	I'm just a hungry college student, not much more to say! 
0	Financial situation is kinda bad, but I wish I could celebrate.
0	 I am about to move to a new apartment, and my girlfriend and I have a need for pizza pie to give us the energy to go. I have no artistic talent or anything to give you in return. How about I make an ms paint picture as a thank you for your good deed (my skills are bad so this should be funny).
0	 Moved to New York recently and the city really is as expensive as everyone says it is. I ran out of cash till Friday and kind of hungry. Just found out about this subreddit and I'd be eternally grateful for anything someone can throw my way. I promise to pay it forward when my payday comes along.  Thank you 
0	Not quite sure how this works.. This is the first New Year I will be without any company. I think there are about 4 other guys living on my floor, but I don't know them. Of course, I can't finish an entire pie by myself so I would love to share with them as well!   I'm here on campus to get some work done before the new semester starts. For the past few meals I have been subsisting on just rice water. In return, I can offer a (poorly) drawn on Paint picture of your request! If you could help, it would be really appreciated. Thanks and Happy New Years to everyone!
0	This is my throwaway as I have family members who are redditors and dont really want them to know I'm asking for help. If you'd like I can send you a message from my regular account to verify. Just need some dinner tonight so I can get my son some shoes tomorrow. I know I could go to pay less and get him some cheapo's he doesnt want and wont last but I hate disappointing him.
0	The title says it all - We don't really have a sob story, other than to say that we're poor and neglected to take something out of the freezer to thaw for dinner tonight.  It's cold outside, and we'd be grateful for some cheesy goodness.  Thanks!  edit: We can pay it forward Friday. Could probably even come with a contest to do so...
0	Some background information.  I just graduated college in June 2012.  I just accepted a job offer for an awesome position but the job has not started yet and I have been living a very limited budget for some time now.  I can offer a picture of us in return and also I also enjoy a healthy conversation with new people.  Went to college in NYC, will be working in Mortgage backed securities and modeling prepayment.
0	we will love you for ever if you buy us some
0	I have a stuffed up nose and I'm cocooned in a blanket on the couch. I'm really hungry and really broke, I don't get paid till next Friday and help would be greatly appreciated. 
0	a RAOPizza would be nice diversion from heat transfer/fluid mechanics/and materials processing.
0	i am a 26 yr old house wife and mother. My family and I have been eating Ramen Nooodles and PB&amp;J sandwiches for the past week and the food stamps dont come in for another 4 days. I would like my family especially my 2 yr old son to have something a little more tasteful to eat.
1	No real sob story here. Just your typical broke-after-paying-rent college student at UNT. Ramen and sandwiches until Thursday seems fairly unappetizing so I was hoping to get a good meal to last through the weekend.  I just discovered this sub and it's awesome. Definitely excited to be able to pay it forward after the money rolls back in...
1	She's 3, wants pizza, and mommy is broke. Will post a picture of her three year old pizza face if you buy us lunch :)
0	Me and my roommate are broke till we get paid tomorrow at 2pm. got a empty fridge and no money. Plan to pay it forward. also willing to draw a picture of something you like(pizza0.o)
1	My father used to order my mother a pepperoni pizza and an order of breadsticks for the two of them to share (My younger brother and I would have our own). He included a special request to have the pepperonis arranged in a smile and would personally place 2 breadsticks on the pizza to give it a mustache.   This always put a smile on her face. My younger brother has autism and my mother has Multiple Sclerosis but has still been working her ass of through the pain.  She lost her job at the end of last August and a month later my father passed away. I just got off the phone with her and she was holding back tears. I really want to make her smile by bringing back some of the good memories of my father and reminding her that there is good in the world.  I do not have a credit card and only have $4 in my bank. I would really like to send her a smiley-face pizza. Can anyone help me put a smile on the most wonderful woman in the world's face?  I promise to pay it forward as soon as I have the funds.  **Edit** USA - AL
0	My University lied and said dining halls would be open all break. As soon as break started they changed the schedules so now they are closed until tomorrow. My roommate and I have run out of food for the weekend and could really use some pizza :C I don't get paid till the 30th and will gladly return that favor :D
0	Title pretty much sums it up, I would like a pizza or two. Would prefer Pizza Hut but Dominos is fine too.
0	Raleigh, NC
0	Well, my boyfriend and I have spent an inordinate amount of money this month on unexpected stuff. My laptop stopped working, and I had to spend the majority of my meager savings on a new one. Our hedgehog got sick and vet bills also took a good chunk of money from us. The only things we have left to eat are grits, eggs, and rice, and while it's enough to live on for now, I'm tired of eating it. Just one pizza would be great, I'm not picky about where it's from. Thanks to anyone who reads this.
0	Howdy everyone! You doin' alright?   This is my first post, and I'm not sure if I'm doin' this right (oh please correct me if I'm doing it wrong!) but here goes, here's why I wish I had a pizza right now (prepare for dramalama):   **The worst:** I just had to tell this girl, the sweetest, funnest, cutest one you could ever imagine, that I didn't feel the same way about her that she did about me. Yes, I would sing her praises yet don't reciprocate, why? I've known her since we were kids, and since we've grown up, I absolutely can't see her as anything more than a little sister. She's never been quite lucky in love, and every fiber of my being knows she deserves more than a "no" from anyone, yet I can't be the one to do it -- I would be lying to myself and to her. Uggghhh, seeing her in this state, and knowing I caused it, is really taking it's toll on me. I've been dreaming about her, and even in my dreams I can't feel the same way, making me wake up only an hour or two into my sleep and unable to go back to sleep due to feeling so miserable.   **The kind-of okay:** Aside from that, I simply don't have any food in the house right now, and my only ride out of this mountainous region isn't coming until (hopefully?) tomorrow, so that I may go get groceries.   So, not having pizza in a long-ass time, I feel like one would definitely bring an umbrella to this raincloud party, as well as tie me over until my friend gets back up here. What say you, friend?
0	I live in Lexington KY. You one of you could donate a pizza, that would be great and I'd appreciate it greatly!
0	My lover and I are far, far away from each other. We are both struggling with income and I want to do something nice for him tonight.   Is there anyone who would help me to send him a pie? I'm sure he's hungry.
1	I work as a security guard at a corporate building with 24/7 security. I work today, 2 to 10 pm central time, in an empty building and tomorrow in an empty building. I am living pay check to pay check so a pizza thrown in as a replacement my PB&amp;J sandwiches would be very appreciated! 
1	I'm a music teacher who also teaches private lessons.  I just got home from lessons today and I'm spent.  I don't have the energy to cook dinner and decided I'd be willing to write an original song on the topic of your choice and record it for you.  The instrumentation will be guitar and voice.  History is filled with musicians and benefactors.  Haydn had the Esterhazy family, Mozart had the Archbishop of Salzburg, Bach had the Duke of Saxeweimar (who threw him in jail).  I could have you (for a much cheaper price I might add).  Seriously, any topic you want.  You want a song, I want a pizza.  Let's make this happen.
1	My bank account is frozen due to 'suspicious activity' which is a mistake on the bank's part but they said there's nothing they can do for 5-6 days on top of that the electricity in my apartment just got turned back on due to a power line getting struck a few days ago and all of the food in my fridge is bad now. I was planning on shopping tonight but with my account frozen, I can't.   I spent the last bit of money I had on-hand to buy my 4 and a half month old son some formula and put some gas into my car. A pizza would do wonders for me tonight.   I'll gladly pay it forward when my bank account becomes unfrozen 
1	I am currently 18 and living on my own, and I have not eaten in the last three days, I am $-1 in the bank, I can provide with proof if required. My check should come on Tuesday, and until that arrives I will be with out any food. I tried contacting my former stepmother for help but that hasn't been any help at all, just voice mail. Any help will be greatly appreciated, and I will attempt to pay it forward the second I can.    Thank you for taking your time to read this. I greatly appreciate it.   Edit: I can provide whatever proof you may need 
0	I'm a life long Arkansan who dearly misses my [Damgoode Pies](http://www.damgoodepies.com/) who was going to Damgood since it was Pie-Squared (or something like that).      I recently moved here for an IT job and I am currently a full time employee but I'm requesting if someone is driving here anytime soon to grab me a large handtossed Spinato. I dont care if it sits in the sun for 2 days, I'll nuke the shit out of it. I'll pay for it and even give you some gas money for your troubles. 
0	I've been stuck at home with an upper respiratory infection and ear infection since last Thursday. On top of that, I broke my pocketwatch while swinging it, and I broke a bracket on my braces while gnawing on a cough drop. A random act of pizza would make my day :) 
1	We don't get our food stamps til Tuesday and are flat broke. Payday is Wednesday and we would be happy to return the favor then!  On Cottman ave.
0	I'm swimming in student debt from my bachelor's degree while working on a master's degree. I live in a neighborhood many pizza delivery places won't go to, and if they do they don't come out of their car and you have to go out to them. I would love a pizza, or a gift card so I could pick up a pizza on my way home from my job. I just recently started making too much to qualify for food stamps anymore, but just barely. My food budget is tight, and things like pizzeria pizza are usually not an option.
0	Title pretty much sums it up. Slow season at my job has left me broke for the next few days. Pizza would put a smile on my face and a meal/two in my belly. I'm in New Orleans. Thanks. 
0	Yesterday my cousin walked in on my girlfriend and I and blue balled me. Left in anger to a friends house, came back in the morning to find my girlfriend passed out in the living room with my cousin and his gf in OUR bed, naked and asleep, where I was cut short of glory. This was after about a week and a half of not getting any at all. Now my gf and her 2 friends are at the beach and I'm home alone with nothing to do. 
0	I'm home by myself and I am on house arrest, so I cannot leave my house. I have absolutely nothing to eat in my pantry or my fridge. Just canned pumpkin spice:(. If someone would like to help me out I would be very grateful and will pass the giving along to someone else in need when I have the means to. This is my first request from a fellow Redditor, and actually any food is appreciated. I can provide proof of my ankle bracelet which prevents me from leaving.( On house arrest for too many curfew tickets. Which is bull****.) I will also make you a video of when I receive the pizza and how grateful I am.    Location details:  I live in Southern Orange county, San Juan Capistrano area. Close to mission viejo and laguna hills.    Also, I do not come from a family of money so I would give an honest appreciation to anyone taking any notice to this. I just want some food. My stomach hurts and there's nothing I can do about it. I have no money and no other way of getting food.
0	Ran out of food money between pay days. I can do photoshop or adobe illustrator requests. Thanks!
0	Today is my birthday and I would love - more than anything - to have some pizza with my friends. I go to the University of Texas at Arlington. I don't really plan on doing much today aside from chilling and hanging out with my friends. I know that there are other people who are more deserving than me, but it's worth a shot to ask, right? Not really asking for much. Anything you can offer would be amazing. If not, at least go give someone else something! Thanks everyone!
1	I'm a single mom on unpaid medical leave. I do receive food stamps, but a random act of pizza would be really terrific. Thank you!
0	If anyone is interested in my story here it is. I was kicked out of my parent's home a few months ago for religious reasons and I'm struggling to make ends meet living on my own. My mormon parents don't talk to me and don't want to have anything to do with me after they found out I'm not going on my mission. I have a job and a room but my hours were weekends only last month and I'm completely broke until the end of this week when I get paid and even then, money is going to be tight for the next few months. I was not really prepared to live on my own like this (I just recently turned 20) and I'm really struggling. I'm trying to eat as little as I can to save as much money as I can and pizza would be amazing right now. (I'm in Toronto, Ontario)
1	I've never posted here before so I hope that I am doing this right. This request is actually for a friend, not for me. She recently broke up with her long-time boyfriend and moved back in with her parents. The ex-boyfriend is moving out of state. She is doing her best in college and has always been a good student but the stress is getting to her and she is starting to slip. I think that a pizza would help her out.  **Edit: horny_toad2006 hooked me up. Thank you so much man, she will appreciate it.**
1	Title says it all. Alone tonight with an empty bank account, maxed out credit card, and a new job interview in the morning (thanks /r/atljobs!).
0	http://imgur.com/7CIFp  Hungry ol' man here... No monies... Please help!
0	Hi all. I heard about this site on the radio, and I thought it was the nicest idea. I have been on both sides of this. Able to give, and in need. We were doing ok until my boyfriend lost his job this past March. Which is fabulous since around the same time we found out we were pregnant with our third child. So he has been pounding the pavement trying to find a new job, and in the meantime my salary gets stretched pretty thin. We use to have pizza night on Friday with the kids. We'd get a movie from the Redbox, enjoy a pizza pie and have a fun family night. Its amazing how you miss simple things like that. I hope we are soon in a position again where we can give more, and need for less. Heck, I hope we all are. Times are just hard, jobs are scarce and I just hope things get better for everyone. But if you are in the position to provide pizza night for a grateful family, it would mean a lot. Maybe show the kids that yes, money is tight...but not everything is changing. Things are going to be okay. And I will surely pay it forward. Thanks for reading :)
0	Title says it all. Today has been absolutely horrible. I was taking my youngest to a doctors appointment and my starter went out, my car is now sitting in the doctor's office parking lot until I am able to get to Cash Advance to take a loan out to get the parts my brother will fix it but being this late I have no way to get to the store with my FSC, I'm really exhausted. My cabinets and refrigerator is completely empty, I can send pictures as proof as well as any other proof. I really just want my children to eat. 
0	Hi we are a family of 3 in louisville ky mom dad and we have a 6 yr old daughter.We are low on food and dont get paid till tomorrow could anyone please help us with some pizza for dinner we are hungry thanks
0	We live in tempe and just haven't been able to afford food for a couple days. We are about running out of options and really hope someone can help us out:( text me for details if your willing to help. God bless you all&lt;3 9283861115
0	I would be so grateful to anyone, if they could help me out with a pizza. Other than the last piece of bread, I've been without food for 2 days.   When people look in their fridge, or pantry, and say "there's no food!" usually there is a lot of food, just not food they want to eat. If you look into my fridge and pantry, you will see some butter, some cooking oils, and a bit of milk.   Le sigh. ;.;  I live in Canada. 
0	I've been trying to convince her of the greatness of reddit and redditors for a while and I think free pizza on her birthday would convince her.
0	I've been eating noodles and peanut butter crackers only for six days.  I don't get paid until Friday. I'm losing my mind. I need something different. Help me break the streak of crackers and noodles.
1	hello:) I never knew about this place! you guys seem awesome. Well I just had a baby almost 2 months ago. Also my car just broke down. We don't really ever leave the house, and she has been not feeling well the past few days. So I'm kind of insane from no sleep/ constant crying. ~[`_Â°]~ ... I'm not starving, we have some plain rice and spinach, but a pizza souneded amazing and money is very tight until I start work again. Even if no one responds, thanks for being here and helping the people that really need it!!
0	No particular sob story here, just had nothing to eat since yesterday afternoon, and I dont get paid till tomorrow night, dominoes &amp; papa johns are the ones in my area.  Thanks folks.
0	If a pizza were to show up at around 11pm at 606 Catherine St., Ann Arbor, MI 48104 a new 4th of july national hero would be born! You'd make independence day for 3 friends that much more awesome!  edit: reward - an imgur album of the us 3 enjoying the pizza, and doing whatever the hero desires or anonymously writes on the box via special instructions, as well as some awesome real life karma
0	i'm really hungry and all my money is going towards my ultrasound tomorrow, pretty please with sugar on top buy me a pizza? i'll send you the ultrasound picture when i found out the gender tomorrow! celebration time! i'll also loveee you forever. thank youuu.
0	Husband, wife and two small kids pizza eating family haven't had one in 4 months no extra cash. Would love one for supper tomorrow any one want to help. Pizza hut is closet to me in IL. 
0	Hi, i moved out 2 weeks ago and just started a new job so i have no money at all. i haven't been able to buy groceries in a week and ran out of food 3 days ago. im just lookin for something small but that i can eat for the next week until my first paycheck. any help would be very appreciated.
0	So, last night I celebrated my 89th day sober. I would like to celebrate my 90th day this evening and since I am not drinking anymore, a pie would be awesome! Ramon isn't much of a celebratory food, no matter how you josh it up. My sponsor knows my financial situation and referred me to this site last night after the meeting. This is a huge day for me, as I have been drinking heavily for 8 years and it's been extremely hard to quit but I have and perhaps there's someone who'd like to celebrate with me. God bless and Stay strong.
0	I don't enjoy asking for charity but if there's one thing that can cheer me up it's pizza.
1	Posted this yesterday, no luck. Just wondering if anyone out there might have a pizza to spare for someone who is out of luck temporarily to enjoy a pizza!  I'm from Houston, TX.  I've been lurking here for several months, and for some reason this was the first place that popped in mind since I got home.  Me and my Sister were in a car wreck last Thursday. We got T-boned in a parking lot by someone who apparently thought talking on their cell phone was more important than watching the road or applying the breaks... Fortunately it was just her and I in the car and they hit the back passenger door, because had they of hit just a foot or two up, I don't think we both would have survived. We were both taken to the hospital in an ambulance, and my wallet was left in our total'd car which was towed. Hopefully it wasn't stolen or anything and it's still where I left it in the car.  Anyway I don't want to ramble, but to sum it up, my Sister and I would be very grateful to anyone willing to help someone out in a tough spot with some pizza. When things get settled out here and I get back on my feet(literally!) then definitely plan on returning the favor to someone who's in a bind and could use the help.  Thank you so much!
0	I'm working on a movie with my school and our director is calling us names, telling me that I'm doing everything wrong and she also lost all of our audio. We lost about a day of filming. She has made this week a living hell, and I have to go film on Sunday and Monday (my days off from school). A pizza would be a real treat. Thanks.
0	Fact is, no food in house. We requested a local Food Bank provide some and have to wait several days. Alas, empty stomach is now.  First time asking help here, insofar right now because things escalated. I am looking for/without work temporarily, my roommate got laid off yesterday.  Hundredthoughts of please and thank you.
1	Hi RAoP  As the title suggests, I have been doing it tough over the last few months.  I am knee deep in debt from being screwed by my partner while trying to start a business.  My current job pays monthly and I am a few days out from being paid but due to some unforeseen vet bills this month, I have found myself without much money or food for the last 2 weeks.   Tonight, I will be having another meal of rice and peas, which I have been surviving on since my cats incident (she is fine now, thankfully) and I am dieing for something nice for a Sunday night.  If there is a kind internet stranger out there who feels like helping someone who has been going through a rough time over the last few months, it would make my entire year!  When I get paid I'll be happy to come visit again to pass the karma on to someone else who needs it.  I live in Australia, if that makes a difference. 
1	Good evening RAOP sub reddit. I have been working all month living in Chicago and was able to just scrape by to pay rent for my fiance and her 12 year old daughter today.   They have just recently come back from Des Moines Iowa after their Mom/Grandmother passed in an extended stay at hospice.  We're about another 10 days out from more food stamp credit on our Chicago Link card.   A friend pointed out this sub reddit as we've only been eating plain pasta noodles all week.   Other then a copy of Final Fantasy XIII I'd found a couple months ago for her (she's a huge fan), we haven't been able to give her daughter a proper birthday yet.   If there is a kind soul out there who'd be kind enough to forward us some pizza, this small Chicago family would be most appreciative.  
0	Me and my roommate spent our last bit of food budget on getting our laundry done and now we're hanging out with a friend and getting really hungry.  We should be considered minimum priority though because all of us will get to eat tomorrow and nobody's actually in danger of malnourishment or anything. Plus if we get desperate we can call in the emergency egg noodle rations.
0	My car broke down on Saturday, and then my bike chain snapped today.   I am very frustrated and tired from my full day of watching little children/walking home in the Memphis heat with a broken bike in tow.  I would love a pizza to help fuel my DIY bike repair.   Thanks.  I promise to use a part of my next paycheck to purchase a pizza for a needy redditor.   
0	My husband is at work for the next 4 hours, using our only car for the rest of the night. It's raining, I'm cold, and my puppy and I are hungry.   Won't anyone take pity on me and our sob story??
0	Hey RAOP!  Recently I found a new job after being laid off, I haven't had the ability to celebrate in proper fashion due to funds going towards keeping a roof over my head and electricity on. Was wondering if you guys could help me celebrate with pizza?  I shall pizza it forward once I get my paycheck as a token of my gratitude! thanks!
0	Lost my job a few months ago and finding anything halfway steady has been hard to say the least. Finally starting a new job soon and would love to celebrate with a real meal. I'm good and video editing and programming so if you need anything in that field I can assist!   Thanks for reading!
1	For quite a while now, I have been nonstop hard at work on an interactive multimedia project called [[6x]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmCqEP2v_Wo) - a double-disc immersive experience with hours of puzzles, "flash films", trip-tools, hallucinogenic visuals, and TONS of hidden features.  Caught between a surreal nightmare and warped mindtrip, this DVD package presents an immersive journey through hypnagogic insomnia in which the viewer is in full control.  Composed from hundreds of sources of bygone media - deconstructed, distorted, glitched and reassimilated into a mind-bending menagerie of disturbing and psychedelic ventures into the user's psyche.  Think of it like a interactive-video-game/experimental-art-film double-DVD set, with a heavy emphasis on the experimental and interactive.  *Note: Contains disturbing and/or adult material. Intended for mature audiences only.*   The project is currently in the autumn stage of development and production (about 70% complete) and slated for release [here](http://0011011001111000.bandcamp.com/) on August 20th, 2013.  Previews available [here](https://www.youtube.com/0011011001111000) and [here](http://0011011001111000.tumblr.com/), though it's difficult to convey the interactive aspect of the project in pictures and videos.  **So here's the thing:** I'm broke right now and pretty hungry, but I do have the DVD package to offer in exchange.  The only hitch is - it won't be released until August 20th.  So if any redditors are interested in the DVD or hooking a hungry brother up with some pizza, comment here!  **EDIT: Feel free to ask any questions about the project as well, I understand it's kind of hard to describe.**
0	I'm pretty much flat broke right now, would love if someone could give me pizza I get paid this Friday so I promise to pay back the favor!
0	Hi all...  I've hit one of those lows. I have $1.95 in the bank and I ran out of the spaghetti I was eating once a day a couple days ago. I spent 30 minutes looking around the house for loose change and managed to find enough to get some peanut butter which is remarkably filling and has kept me relatively satisfied since. But it's running out and before I start pawning things off I thought I'd try to look for my own personal Pizza Jesus. Thank you all for the awesomeness that is RAOP.  [money](http://imgur.com/LTQk5.jpg)  [what I have survived on for two days](http://imgur.com/jn6Eh)  Needless to say I will contribute at my first financial opportunity.  edits: spelling. because that's still important.
0	Just a couple of hungry teens (16) willing to do just about anything for one free pizza!
0	Throwaway account, I have friends that are redditors  Recently my wife lost her job, we have too many bills, my mother passed away due to diabetes and now I just got in a crash recently. I have a lot of bills but not enough money and my family suffers for that. A pizza would really help us cope with all this bs that life is throwing our way. I have a beautiful wife and a really awesome son who I love very much. I know begging is the last thing people want to do but I am at that level. I don't know what to do and I have barely enough money to cover all of this. I would really appreciate it if someone would gift us a pizza and I'm sure so would my family. The chances of me getting one are low but its still worth a try. God bless you for reading this and thank you. If by some miracle someone gifts us one then I would gladly repay the favor when I get back on my feet.
0	Hi, I'm a retired Army Sargeant going through a tough time. I need help feeding my family this evening and if anyone can help I'll be gladly appreciated. Thanks for reading this hope someone can help us out.
1	Hello!  I haven't had pizza in the longest time and I have this *huge* craving for it. If there is someone who is in dire need of food please skip me and go to them! But if not, I'd love to celebrate the end of a day with some awesome sauce pizza. 
0	http://imgur.com/xtzEuvC  sidewalk dropped out of nowhere about three feet and forced me to eat shit. could really use some encouragement. 
0	We got a ton of freezing rain last night and the sidewalks are slick and, its brutally cold outside. I would appreciate a pizza for my roommate and me to warm us up. I am not financially strained or anything, just excited to try this out. If this works out I definitively am going pay it forward sometime. 
0	My girlfriend's going in to hospital midday tomorrow for a certain "procedure", which means as of this morning she's fasting and only permitted to consume clear liquids. I'm unfortunately out of work and in recent weeks she's been working hard to support the both of us and I'm really grateful and proud of her and would love to treat her once this is over tomorrow evening, but the sad fact is that I simply can't afford to do so. Help me to give her a small treat that I feel she deserves.      Picture of the lovely meds that she's got to take in preparation for tomorrow:   http://i.imgur.com/64OR9.jpg
1	Haven't made the best choices lately and I'm broke. I'm supposed to start working next week but until then I'm struggling. All I have are some stale chips and a pack of gummi bears. If anyone could help I'd be so appreciative. 
0	I am feeling depressed. I do not know if it is the study of law and the tedious reading that goes with it or the hunger in my belly causing it. If some kind soul wishes to help me eliminate the hunger in my belly, we can narrow the source. I would eternally grateful to any kind soul wishing to assist me in these trying times.
0	Didn't bring my lunch today (not sure what I would've brought anyway) and currently overdrafted do to some issues splitting a checking account.  Would love to get a pizza, all that is nearby is a local store though and the only way I can tell that pizza could be purchased remotely is to send a $10/$25 gift card. I can't eat a whole pizza by any means so a $10 card would be enough for two slices and something to drink.  I get paid in 2 weeks and will be returning the RAOP favor for a needy soul then.  Edit: Forgot I drew a [picture of pizza](http://imgur.com/sZgfa) just because
0	Wrestling season has its ups and downs. A big down happens to be very little pizza in my life. Since im on break, it would make my day if someone could get me a pizza. Being a student straps me down on cash and i cant pay for one right now. Any response would be much appreciated.
0	It's not about the food. I have dinner already made, so I won't be going hungry. I just think itll be funny watching what my parents do getting free pizza when we already ate dinner. If they'll take it out not, if they'll argue of what. Actually, if someone could get the pizza to arrive at like 9 or 10, it'll probably be even better. It doesn't even need to be pizza, just something, breadsticks maybe. Just something to make my parents wonder why there's summertime at our door at 10 o clock
0	Hey,  I live in Moscow, ID and had a ton of bills this week that ate up all of my funds, I won't have anymore money until around the first, and I am completely out of food...little help please?
0	Hey all. I recently have gone completely broke. .90 cents to my name. I recently applied to graduate schools, and paid rent as well, so I have nothing to my name until next week, when I get paid. If anyone out there can help me out, I would immensely appreciate it, and would return the favor after next Friday (1/11/13).  Thanks. 
0	My names Marcus and I live in Georgia. Basically I got uninvited to a dinner party tomorrow and I'm stuck out of luck in the food department until Sunday. I got some tuna but no bread or mayo, 2 cans of chef boyardee, a few hamburger pattys but no buns, and a can of black beans. That's the literal contents of my fridge and pantry, and while it's better than nothing at all like some folks have I'm a little less than thankful this year.  My mom died last year and I'm still paying out of pocket to get everything situated with that. If I have any other family I don't know them so spending the holidays with anyone is out of the question. My girlfriend went up to Tennessee but I couldn't get off work so eating with her family is out of the question. And my best friend of over three years told me flat out today his wife doesn't want me to come because her parents are going to be there. So for the first time in my life I'm completely alone on turkey day and it's depressing the heck out of me.  So yeah, no family or friends or money means no black olives, turkey, gravy, those little marshmallows, etc for me tomorrow. Any way I could score some pizza money today so I can get some wings or something? I'd much rather warm something up tomorrow than eat a can of plain tuna or some lousy canned spaghetti. Thanks for any help or well wishes you might offer.
0	Hello all.  I'm looking to barter digital work for pizza.  Since there is a Domino's in town, and since they have an eGift system in place, they are my preferred pizza source. :-)  This work could be along the lines of...      MS Office stuff      website stuff      digital art stuff      digital audio stuff      digital video stuff      programming / scripting stuff      tech support stuff  Basically, computer-related stuff. :-)  My guidelines are...      nothing illegal (not looking for jailtime...)      nothing NSFW (not looking for jailbait...)      nothing unreasonable (imma not cloning teh Googelz for just a pizza...)  Feel free to pm with your projects, and we can go from there.  Thanks everyone.  Nom 
0	I was away on business for the first two weeks of August.  I've been back for the last two weeks, but I've been extremely busy with work so I haven't been grocery shopping.  After leaving the office on about the 9th 14 hour or so day, I realized I had left my wallet in our Core location.  While this normally wouldn't be a big deal, that is the only location I don't have access to outside of business hours.  I found this out as I was at the grocery store getting ready to buy some food (I figured it was time).  Now I'm hungry and tired. Oh, and I have to head to the office for a maintenance window in another 7 or so hours.  Any generous souls out there?  Edit:  I should sleep instead.  I realize I can get back to my wallet tomorrow and a few hours hungry isn't going to kill me.
1	My next paycheck wont come til friday the 16th.  Until then I have exactly $12.88 in my account to get gas to get me to work and food.  A pizza could easily feed me for 3+ days :)  I had an unexpected illness which left me out of work for some time and my job does not compensate for sick time.  Anyone willing to help a guy out?  I will be sure to pay it forward when I get back on my feet financially!
0	My boyfriend kicked me out of his car right in the middle of NYC. All I have on me is my phone. I have been crying my eyes out for the past hour. My purse is still in the car with my wallet, credit cards, id. I have no idea what to do now, I live 50 minutes away on car from the city. I didnt eat all day and would really want something to get my mind off this situation and try to get back home some way.
0	***EDITED***  Edit: My friend offered to buy me pizza. Hopefully another time, RAoP'ers!  ~~I'm a student at the University of Northern Iowa and I'm working on a web application that I think will be massively useful and hopefully nicely profitable for me Some Day(tm). But until it makes me money, I'm basically broke.~~  Looking forward to the day I can give back a random act of pizza,  Aaron
0	Things just haven't been going the right ways. My friends and I have been getting distant... I feel like I've been sleeping all day and there is nothing in the house to eat. Perhaps a pizza could help?
0	I am new to this my mother told me about it this morning when i came running to her house because i woke up and went to go make my two boys eggs and my burner wouldn't turn on so i have it set to where i can get it back on friday but until my friend comes and picks the boys up for me i can not cook anything for them so if someone could please help they dont get picked up until around six-ish.
0	I run a business doing smartphone unlocking. I will unlock your phone for pizza. I'm not necessarily broke, I'm just feeling lazy today. I can't do every model, and it's pretty much limited to either AT&amp;T or T-Mobile phones. I can't do every kind of phone, but here is a suggestion of ones I am willing to do with processing time involved: AT&amp;T iPhone (1-24 Hour) AT&amp;T Non-iPhone (1-24 Hour) T-Mobile HTC (Instant [1-60Min]) AT&amp;T HTC (Instant [1-60Min]) Blackberry (Instant [1-60Min]) iPhones are unlocked through iTunes, all others are unlocked with a code. You are required to have a SIM Card from another carrier to complete the unlock. I am just going to give you the unlock code. Also I have to mention, I cannot unlock your phone if it was put into contract on or after January 26, 2013...so please only older phones.
0	Im a father of one son and I have a fiance, both living with me. Times have been so rough the past couple of months financially. I was collecting unemployment while i was actively searching for a new job and luckily was blessed last week with finding one. I just started work but unfortunately my unemployment didnt go on this month and I wont get a paycheck for a couple more weeks as they hold back for a week and pay bi-weekly. we are desperate for food, even tried going to a food bank but they they arent open til wednesday and we have nothing for me or my fiance or son to eat til then. I hate asking for assistance from others but Ive never been in this bind before and I'm really hoping someone out there could bless us with a pizza for dinner. It would be amazing, and I would be more than happy to pay it forward with my first check to another needy family facing the same difficulties as we are at the moment. Thank you all for reading my long post and bless you  .... We are located in KY btw
0	Ive got that pizza craving again, please help my suffering.   NOODZ FOR PIZZA XD JK
0	I'm using a throwaway account because I'm pretty embarrassed about asking reddit to buy me food, but I really have nowhere else to turn to. I live alone and I'm currently jobless. I once had a nice amount saved up in the bank, but unexpected expenses and bills have made it impossible for me to get through the rest of the month. The pantry is bare and so are my pockets. Literally. I ate my last Ramen packet a couple days ago and I just don't think I'm going to be able to make it until November. If there's anybody willing to help me out soon, I would appreciate it. I will return the favor as soon I am able to.  **EDIT 1:** I appreciate the input! Thank you for your advice, guys. As soon as I get the chance, I'm going to check out a food drive to get me through next week. I just gotta find a way to get through the next day or so!
1	My poor cat [Pandora](http://imgur.com/onbwp) fell ill a few days ago, so I took her to the vet. She's on Endro Floxacin (22.7 g) for the next week. It took the last of my cash ($100) to get her some help, and I still owe some but it's not due until February. I'm currently in school but will be working soon. My mom is sending me some cash in the mail but it won't get here for a few days. Any help would be nice :)
1	My foot is swollen and I really should stay in bed, unfortunately I'm getting hungry and shouldn't really stand around the kitchen and cook. Being a college student, I'm also tight on money - so a random pizza would be awesome. :)  I'm not sure what I can give in return, but when I do get around to getting paid, I'd be more than happy to continue on the random acts of pizza.
0	Hello, I am making this post because my friends and I are currently being held hostage by a pizza troll in Kalamazoo, MI. The pizza troll demands we provide him pizza or else we can not leave. Unfortunately we have no money, please save us from our pizza troll and next time we can save you! (We are really hungry and have no money right now, if you could help us out that would be really wonderful and we will pass the favor along when we can.)
1	I have an awsome neighbor who's a single dad of 3 (under the age of 9) he lost his job 3 weeks ago.  I help him out when I can with food for the kids, but I'm a single mom myself, so I can't keep it up much longer. He's been eating Ramen noodles for the past 2 days, he's a great guy, going out there applying for jobs, unfortunately going through a rough time lately!! Please help lift his spirts! Thanks!!
0	Much appreciated, i really have had a horrible week.
0	All my roommates have left for the night to go party...and im home sick, if any of you guy would cheer me up and gift me a pie it would be greatly appreciated
0	Right now I am between jobs,My work decided to down size and fired a large group of people myself included.  Last week my six year old daughter began very ill she couldn't keep any of her food down,She wasn't able to talk was having breathing issues and had a fever of 102 so we took her to the hospital before she became worse. During our hospital visit we learned her tonsils were swollen and needed to be removed her throat was almost completely swollen shut, she also has a bad case of bronchitis. The hospital stay and surgery to get her tonsils removed so she could breath left us with a bill of $2736 money we don't have we are crushed we have discussed a payment plan but it will throw us off with monthly costs my wife hardly makes enough for all of our current bills.House wise we are either out of or almost out of house hold supplies and food items.  The kids and my wife would love a nice hot meal we are in walking distance to a Pizza Hut [they do take out only] a dinner deal box would be best. We have three children,my wife and myself.
0	Hit the random button just now and found this subreddit. I have to be tested soon so i have to give it up. I live in texas
0	Big economy issues. I haven't eaten more than a couple nectarines since Thursday, and there's not much to eat in this house. I've got three little siblings with mental disabilities whom I would like to feed before myself, so...anything edible usually goes to them first. Anyway, yep, if you need any more info I can provide it.
0	I'm working part time now, my hours were recently cut, and I can't even afford to pay my current bills. I am about to get a new job in insurance sales, which will cure my financial woes (and will be able to pay it forward). However, I have a class and an exam to take and then I have to apply for a license, and it's still gonna be several weeks. In the meantime, I'm super hungry. And pizza just sounds so damn good. I'm in Virginia, if that matters.
0	and I couldn't be happier! I'm so thankful to be employed. It's at a distribution center and I was always the type of girl to work in an office. Not any more, I love it! My dad (who literally has 2 dollars in his pocket) and I are here alone while my mom is away and would love a pizza to share. I will happily pay it forward once I start getting my first paychecks! Thank you!
0	I'm new here so please have patience while I figure this out. I'm having a pregnancy craving for pizza but flat broke till payday. (Can show pics of the cobwebs in my wallet) I'm really cheap! Dominoes only costs me like $15ish to deliver and I have $5.97 in the bank so all I need is $10 in a dominos ecard or something! Would gladly love to repay the favor on payday! I think this is a great idea! Also I'm in the southern California area. 
1	So everyone has left for Thanksgiving break already and I'm here alllll by myself alternating between Battlefield 3, Mirrors Edge, L.A. Noire and.... MW3. I'm broke as a joke and starvingg! Help me obi wan, your my only hope!!
0	My GF and I of two years just broke up.  I don't feel like cooking or moving but I know that I should eat so I was hoping that someone would throw this bummed out dude a za.  
0	Im in 9th grade and live in minnesota. Last week (dec 3-7) i had to stay up all night 3 days in a row to finish homework. I am fairly proud of myself for persevering through it and wanted to buy myself a pizza, but being a broke 15 year old, i can't...     
0	I'm from MS and I've been waiting since Monday for my paycheck to arrive at my work with no luck.  I could use a little something to hold me over.  Will gladly pay it forward when it arrives.  Thanks guys.  
0	I lost my wallet which has my cash/credit card/university ID and such. I'm on a meal plan here, but I can't go to the cafeterias since I don't have my ID. I could really use a pizza right now. :/
0	I'm a homeless mother of 3 kids in Bloomington IN. My case worker told me about this page and I thought I would give it a shot. If you could help me and my kids for the night I would be very grateful. We're staying in a hotel for the night that my mom is paying for and she is letting me use her computer. I hope you'll reply. thank you so much!
0	Hey RAOPers, today's been a pretty shitty day. I've been suffering from depression all semester long, and it's really affected my school work. I found out from our disabilities services counselor that I won't be able to pass two of my classes this semester. I also had a really shitty therapy session today that mainly resulted in a lot of crying. I hate to post a sob story, but a pizza right now would do a lot to cheer up my night, but I'm also really low on cash. I get paid next Friday, and I promise I'll pay it forward after getting my paycheck. Thanks so much!
0	Hey RAOP, My friend's house was robbed last night and I want to do something to ease the shock of it all. I figured the best way is through the power of pizza. The delicious power of pizza.  
1	Hey Guys,  I'm not one to ask for charity. I'm just in a little bit of a pinch. I just recently started a new career and as such I've now been about 3 weeks without a paycheck. With paying my rent and all my bills, I'm now down to about $8 to live off of until my first paycheck comes on friday. As soon as I'm in a better way, I want to pay it forward. So if anyone could be of help, would be incredibly grateful. Thank you!)
1	For the past two months, I have been trying to get a job (but with still no luck) so I could get the money to pay my college just over $500 by the end of June so I can continue going to school. Luckily, my parents were kind enough to help me pay that by taking on twice as many hours at work. However, with the deadline for the college payment being in the next few days, the house has very little food for the rest of week.   I feel bad that my parents are working so hard and giving up so much because of me, and I would like to pay them back and give them a decent meal for the night (and leftover-lunch).  If anyone is willing enough to give a $12 eGift Card for Dominos to help, I am totally capable of using online coupons like a boss to be able to feed my whole family very well.  TL;DR my family has very little food now and we would greatly appreciate a $12 eGift Card for Dominos to feed the whole family.
0	Looking for someone to be really kind and buy a pizza or some food, within UK, not really bothered to what, as haven't eaten properly for the last few weeks and anything would be very much appreciated.  Been left with very little money this month thanks to unknowing bills popping up, and my boyfriends mobile company giving him an expensive bill of Â£56 compared to his usual Â£25.. So I've had to lend money I didn't really have to help save his ass.   I'd/We'd be really grateful to any offers of any kind of food. Since we haven't ate much of anything for the last few weeks.  So I will say thank you in advance of any extra kind Redditors!! :D
1	My mother is away on holiday for 5 days. Don't want to sound like she abandoned me or anything, I was happy to stay and watch our dogs. The only thing is, she didn't leave me money, instead she actually bought food at supermarket for me. She didn't realize though that the food she had left me wouldn't last the entire weekend because its now out of date. Not her fault if anything probably mine since I already ate the food that wouldn't be out of date on Thursday and Friday and left the now out of date food (stupid I know) and now I got no food or money until Tuesday. All I would be looking for is a plain margarita pizza.  It would be absolutely amazing if someone was to buy me a pizza for my dinner later tonight!
1	I may have gotten my subreddits mixed up, is there a difference between this one and /r/randomactsofpizza?  Oh well, might as well try both...  So a little over 3 weeks ago I lost my job, and I THOUGHT I had another job lined up, but unfortunately that fell through. I've been barely making a meal a day out of bare bones food (ramen, rice, beans) and have no money to buy anything else at the moment. The job hunt is not going as smoothly as I had hoped, and apparently I have to wait until NEXT week for unemployment to give me anything, which will go mostly to my rent.   With every day I don't get a new job my situation seems bleaker and bleaker. And the fact that I've been barely surviving on a meager portion of tasteless crap every day is not helping my outlook on life. I don't think I could write the words that would properly convey what a nice, crispy, cheesy pizza would do to boost my spirits, and I don't want to get my hopes too far up by typing it out.  All I'm gonna say is, if any kind soul out there would send some pizza my way (I'm in NYC, btw) it would mean the world to me.
1	So I spent the weekend with a good friend of mine and his room mate. In exchange, I just ordered them a pizza and a couple of 2 liters of Mello Yellow. Being college students, they hadn't had the money to go to a grocery store and their fridge consisted of a carton of eggs and a pitcher of koolaid. I felt like they needed it. Anywho, my problem now is that now that I've bought someone else pizza, I really want some. It's just me so a small one would do fine and I have plenty of drinks in my dorm. I'd be ever grateful. &lt;3
0	Well, the title pretty much explains it. At around 8pm Pacific time my neighbor and I are having a Halo 2 System-Link party until around 2am. Currently my neighbor only has chips to snack on for the party so it would be pretty wicked if someone helped us out by sending some random pizza!
0	Girlfriend left me last week, told me why last night-said that I didn't make her truly happy and that all of her "I love you and won't leave" has been a lie for the past undisclosed amount of time. Figure pizza might make me better. But all my money just went into my gas tank...
0	It's almost embarassing to even put this up but I really need some help.  I live in TN.    If someone fulfills the request I will do my best to pay it forward within the month, thanks.
0	so my stash of ramen ran out. i was so poor all i could afford was ramen but now im so poor i cant even afford any more. so to sum it all up im out of ramen. can i have a pizza? here's why.  1. all i could afford prior to running out of ramen is ramen 2. im out of ramen 3. cant afford anymore ramen  do you guys see that im poor cause all ive been eating is ramen? okay pizza time now. ramen  *willing to show proof of the no ramen in my cabinets. im all out of ramen and it was all i could afford before but now i cant even afford any
0	This is my first RAOP Request! Thanks, dudes.
0	As the title says I am not doing so well with money this week and I don't have much food, I just want some pizza, I will repay you in a few days, I promise!
0	broke college student, would love to taste pizza on my tongue tonight. hook me up!
1	Not gonna post a sob story, me and my husband are just getting pretty tired of plain rice and frozen burritos. Help us have a tasty dinner and we will give the gift of pizza to someone in a week when we get paid. 
1	Hi ROAP! I am going through a rough time right now. My fiance left me recently and going from a two income household to one hasn't been easy. Especially with debt from some credit cards and loans in my name that were used to benefit the both of us. I will be honest I am not starving to death, but I am really upset and it would really cheer me up to have something with flavor to eat. ( I have been eating mostly oats, rice, and beans ) I am willing to use the verifaction system to check my ip and email to prove I am not a scammer. Thanks!
0	This is a throwaway account because my family and friends are redditors.   I have been having a hard time lately and don't know what to do. My girlfriend of 2 years broke up with me recently, my dad passed away, my depression is getting to me, I'm failing 2 college classes, and I just lost my job. I know this subreddit isn't for begging but I just want a pizza to help clear my mind off of things. I know its not much but winning a pizza would actually make me a little bit happy. If you would be so kindly as to give me a pizza then I would be thankful. I live with 2 other people in a dorm room (if that matters) in Houston, Texas. Thank you for taking the time to read this post and have a good day. I know there are a lot of scammers on this subreddit so if no one comments or gifts me a pizza then no worries. I will gladly repay this favor when I get the chance to. God bless you and thanks for reading this. 
1	Here it is, the first of the month.  My bills are paid off, I'm in minimal debt, and once again both my mother and my ex-girlfriend haven't paid me back.  I have some rice and a can of green beans, and hot sauce.  If I could collect interest or force them to pay, I would, but I'm just not the kind of guy to stress the important ladies in my life just so I can enjoy a small luxury of life; so I'm asking YOUUU!  I don't have much to give in return, but I'm a fairly decent wordsmith and I do still have some l3375k1ll5 online, so I can even play something with you if you're that bored, or write you something.  My senior humanities project was a Star Trek fan script, fyi.  Thanks in advance to all whom at least read this lone whimper in a sea of screams.  EDIT: PIZZA DELIVERED IN LESS THAN AN HOUR.  HOLY BALLS THAT'S FAST THANKS FOR ONE LAST TIME, PWNDCAKE.    he deserves his badge of kindness!  EDIT 2: LAVA CAKES MOFOS~!   LAAAVAAAA CAAAAKES.
0	Mom decided to ditch us to get her nails done and hit up a bar, she left us pancakes for breakfast and nothing for lunch and dinner God knows when she'll be back. Tried texting our dad but he responded with "Busy at work". Our fridge has some stuff in it but nothing really edible by itself sadly. No other options left except ask the RAOP community! Help us RAOP you're our only hope! ( It's my first time on Random Acts of Pizza please be gentle =D )
1	hello! i just subscribed today, so maybe this is a shot in the dark, but... i'm a severely underemployed freelancer with way too much time between work/checks... super hungry at the moment, and would love some pizza. the only place around here is dominos, but that's fine cos they're pretty cheap. i submitted invoices this week for $650, so i would gladly repay double the pizza when i get my checks, which will hopefully be later this week but no later than the following. anyway, thanks for reading, what you guys do here is awesome :D
1	I haven't eaten anything other than rice or ramen noodles for the past week. My roomie is in not much better shape. Both of us are broke as hell and some pizza would really cheer us up.  Edit: location is Bloomington Minnesota a suburb of the twin cities.
1	I am serving my second AmeriCorps term in Denver, CO.  My food stamp case was recently closed because they send the follow-up paperwork to my previous address despite me calling and updating my address when I moved.  It will take approximately a month to go through the process again and receive food stamps.  If you're familiar with AmeriCorps, you know we serve nonprofit organizations for a very, very small monthly stipend.  Any assistance would be appreciated from the bottom of my heart!  TL;DR: Food stamps taken away through no fault of my own and I could use the help!
0	Hey y'all, I'm down to less than a dollar until Friday's check and noodles taste only so good after ten packages of them. Would someone be willing to ship me a basic pepperoni? I'm willing to trade pictures of me doing amusing things that don't involve any orifices and intend to return the gift of pizza in the future!
0	Panama City, FL: We are very low food at the moment I have 1 pack of pork chops left till we get out food stamps on the 5th. I was hoping to find a pizza hero for today, the kids are tired of oddles and noodles. We have Dominoes, Pizza Hut, Hungry Howies, all that deliver here. (I dont have a working car). Two large pies will serve lunch and dinner for us. Please consider our family, thank you. Stay blessed.
1	Just checking this out, I've been consumed by Reddit recently and am now branching out into the subreddits (does this count as one? lol Im new to all of this).   Not really a sob story but hey Ill tell you whats up in my life right now. I live with my gf of 4 years in a modest apartment in some suburb in between Dallas and Fort Worth. In May I was laid off by Best Buy when they closed the facility I was working in and moved it to Kentucky. I have been on unemployment since and have been finding it a might difficult to find a job that will allow me to pay my current bills better than unemployment can. I've gone to college on and off since graduating high school in 03 (if you had asked me then if id be be a college-dropout on unemployment 8 years later...I would've called you nuts) I suppose this is how life goes.   I'm not sure if this is too long of a post for this and I apologize if it is!  if I don't end up getting pizza, that's all good.. I understand that there may be someone in a more grave situation and by all means I would love for them to get it before I.   EDIT: OH! I'm an artist so I would be willing to draw any random thing for free pizza (dont expect it to be like mind-blowingly amazing but I will definitely try to make it cool!) if interest is shown in that avenue, I can link to my photobucket to show my style and see if there is still an interest. thanks all!
0	My roommate and I are both college graduates who have not managed to find employment yet, just looking for a good pizza! Will post pic with thanks, and pay it forward!
0	So im unemployed and currently living with my brother. He went out of town and left me with a little bit of food. but he got delayed and is staying an extra day so i am out of food. I had lunch yesterday but wont have another way to get food until tomorrow night so a pizza or 2 would really help carry me over until he gets back in town. I hope this works. I can even make a drawing of anything for you if you would like.
0	Hello there! Long time lurker of Reddit, this sub inspired me to finally sign up. As post says, craving just a pepperoni pizza from Papa Johns and I don't get paid until next week. Not feeling ramen tonight, and I'd be happy to return the favor next week!! I'm in central PA if that matters.
0	Don't mean to beg, but I had been left to care for my parents' dogs for the week. However, they didn't leave me much money for the week to buy groceries (they left last Saturday) and I haven't really had much to eat. I'd grab groceries but I just made a huge school payment and am doing pretty lousy.   If you're a producer or musician, I'd love to discuss works with you, or check out your tracks. I'll try and advertise some of your work in gratitude :)  Here's my stuff: https://soundcloud.com/cjrsongs  (12pm EST) 
0	I am one of the few that can say I bought at a house at the age o 20.  With this, I found comes many, many extra bills I never thought of.  Food doesn't always come first, and I'm pretty broke right now, and would appreciate anyone willing to send a pizza my way.  Nothing major is required or asked for.
0	Yup, late for work, and it's been a long, hungry day (and of course, payday is a day away). Would be awesome to get pizza'd! Oh, and I'm an Oklahomie.
0	I run a struggling small business in southwest Ohio. Things aren't going so well, but I'm pretty certain once I get a nice clientele they'll ease up.  I live in an apartment with my girlfriend... between the two of us we struggle to pay for food, and suddenly I have a terrible cold (my fever just broke 100 degrees, and I've had fluid in my lungs a couple times... hoping it's not walking pneumonia), meaning working is impossible for me.  On top of that, just before the cold we had a condom break on us, so the money that would have gone to a copay to the doctor's office instead went to buying a morning after pill. I seriously hope it works. We've been trying to get regular birth control for *months,* but all we seem to do is struggle with the insurance company.  Just a little good news would be nice. Even if it's just "yes I'll buy you a pizza."  EDIT: I don't have much to offer, but my girlfriend can probably sketch you a little something if you want!
0	I have never requested a pizza before but I've given a few out, so I'm a firm believer that this works. However, I'm spending Christmas with the in-laws, who are sceptical about the generosity of Redditors. Please prove them wrong with a pizza! Will send a thank-you of the whole fam, including cat! We are in R.O.I
0	Hi everyone, I am dealing with some pretty severe back pain atm.  I'm not sure if its a pulled muscle or something like sciatica, all I know is its driving me crazy.  If someone would be kind enough to send a pizza my way in the Indianapolis area, it would do a lot to cheer me up and I'd love you for it, thank you.
1	Rather hungry and also broke. I sure hope I am in luck. I wish the very best for your requests, fellow hungry redditors! 
0	I only have 3 days until I'm done exams and I'm getting to the last of my food (will run out today) and money for the term(down to $10). I am hoping that one of my fellow redditors will add a little pizzazz to my diet with some pizza. I'm from Ontario Canada and go to the University of Waterloo and major in Math, so if you need any help there I can help you out in exchange. 
1	Hey guys,  I don't get the next installment of my student loan until next month and I'm working on an essay about "if" tonight and would love a pizza as brain food. I will promise to pay it forward next month when I get paid, you can even chase me up on it if you like!
0	I've been emotionally rocky the last few days.  Being around people has been very upsetting to me the last few days, I just got off work about an hour and a half ago and had to immediately find a quiet spot outside to break down for half an hour.  I'm sure this is just stress, I moved/graduated/got a new job recently and don't have any close friends in my new area yet (besides a college friend who thankfully moved to this area too).  I'm taking the night off to stay in and heal.  It would be awesome to be able to nibble on a pizza while doing so.  Promise I'll pay it forward in the near future.
0	My financial aid still hasn't come through for me at school yet, so I've had to front my tuition bill. When it finally goes through, I will gladly return the favor to another human in need. 
1	I was laid off in January and have been receiving unemployment since then while trying to find more work, but existing bills wipe out pretty much all of my funds every month aside from basic foodstuffs. My fiancee recently started a plush toy business but it is building slowly and doesn't bring in very much money for us yet. We've been eating variations on beans and rice, potatoes, and stir fry for the last several weeks and frankly we're both really tired of it.  We both tried donating plasma today (there is a company near our house that pays $20 for a first donation), but she's on lithium so couldn't do so and the phlebotomist informed me that I couldn't give because my veins were too narrow. For the first time in months things are looking up--I have three or four good job leads that could be coming to fruition in the next couple of weeks--and we really were hoping to get some pizza as a change of pace.  My fiancee even says she'd be happy to send a plushy as thanks once we've got the money to ship something out--I'd be happy to provide examples of her work via PM if you're interested.  Thanks for looking!  * edit: Should probably add that, while we live in Dallas proper, we live in a very rural part of Dallas and the only major chains nearby that deliver to our area are Pizza Hut and Papa Johns (yes, I know reddit hates Papa Johns).  * edit2: been pizza'd thanks to pineapple_wolf! Woo!
0	So my new boss (I work at a math tooterin' center) messed up adding me to the payroll and I don't get paid til next Friday.  I spent the last of my money yesterday by ordering an eggroll for pickup with the last ~$2 in my bank account then buying veggie fried rice with my last $4 in change when I went to get it (real sneaky sorta cept I shoulda just bought ramen/cheap groceries).  I'm seeing my family this weekend so they'll definitely feed me, but til then it's not looking good.     I'm not gonna link to the music cause I don't want this to come off like a sneaky promo, but if you want to hear it and you message me I won't turn you down
0	I'm so hungry, I boiled up 2 potatos this morning but that was the last food in the house. Definitely intend on paying the favor forward when I get my check next wednesday.
0	Starting a new job Monday but I'm on my bum until then. Friend told me to try here. Could anyone possibly send some deliciousness to me tonight?
0	Friends, countrymen, Redditors!  Lend me your ears!  NW Arkansas  A group of 3 people who don't have enough money to get food would like a pizza.  Verification ready.  Also, you will get a cameo in my first All Flesh Must Be Eaten role playing game.  Love,  Glistening Dragon 
1	Lost my job a few weeks ago, and the pantry has run dry. I would glady repay any generosity shown here this evening. I'm being evicted from my home within a week or so. Any food would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time.
0	I had a small service going and I would just charge people in paypal for those services. A few weeks later I found out that about half of them end up charging back even though they were all "satisfied" with my services.   Now paypal just calls me and I really don't know what to say. I don't have money to negate my - balance and could use a pizza to cheer me up.   Here's a picture of my balance:  http://i.imgur.com/CGthQ.png It was actually 100 something but I manage to win one dispute was too late to reply to another because I didn't check my paypal.  
1	EDIT: User IamSeth saved the day!!! Thank you so much! http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1g3me0/thanks_iamseth_your_generosity_fills_our_hearts/  It's been a difficult couple months for my boyfriend (22M) and I (23F).  He is currently unemployed and looking for a job, and I am self employed, but all my income has been needed to cover our bills while my boyfriend has been out of work, so there is absolutely nothing left.  I spent the whole afternoon trying to get local assistance to put some money on our M-Power card (a pay-as-you-go program for electricity here in Phoenix Arizona) to NO AVAIL : ( all our local agencies are either full for appointments or not assisting those without children in the home.  So we are keeping our apartment dark and very warm (it's currently 108 degrees outside!) having to be extremely cautious with any ac use as our electric is about to run out.  My boyfriend ran around today using the very last of our gas going to job interviews and the required drug testing.  We could really just use a filling dinner so we can collect our thoughts and regroup since we need all the energy we can get to figure out a way to cover our very basic needs until we get more income.  There are no groceries here, I actually used the last of what we had here (some vegetables, rice, and tuna) to feed our two dogs.  Of course we would be incredibly grateful with any form of help from anybody.  A Pizza Hut gift card would be amazing, and any other help as well.  I do understand there are other subreddits for assistance also and I will look into those guidelines to see if it is appropriate for me to post there too.    In exchange for any help someone can give I would like to make you a small beaded item.  I could do a brooch or a pendant with seed beads, crystal, felt, some semi precious gem beads I have here.  You could tell me what colors you like and I could make something for you or a loved one.  I am open to suggestions.  Included are examples of what I can do.  http://i.imgur.com/4rTLqft.jpg http://i.imgur.com/HVsPqO6.jpg http://i.imgur.com/ycN1RI2.jpg  Thank you for taking the time to read this.
0	Things have been a bit tight around here lately. Our kids (4 and 5 year old boys) have been asking for pizza for weeks and we always have to say no since our food budget is only enough for groceries, no extras. Our oldest got the best color possible in school Friday (purple!) for the first time and we'd love to celebrate with pizza.  We're hoping for just one more lean month before we're out of the hole and are able to pay it forward.  Thanks for reading!
1	I guess my situation is pretty typical. I'm unemployed and in school and trying to make every cent last as long as possible. That means a diet of mac and cheese, sandwiches, ramen, and cereal. Prepared foods like pizza are luxuries that I haven't been able to afford in a very long time. It's eight bucks for one lunch at a Chinese restaurant, or eight bucks to buy bread and meat for sandwiches that week. So if anyone has a spare pizza lying around I'd be grateful for it.
1	Could kill for a Pizza... i've spent all day digging a pond in my disabled parents garden, since im unemployed at the moment due to being a student, i've been trying to keep busy and help out other people at the same time. Hopefully i'll get a reply for this :)  Edit:  Downvotes already? Awesome :/
0	Anyone please? California.
0	This might seem odd, but I have had a fairly bad and disappointing birthday. I've been having a generally difficult week leading up to today and I would just appreciate a pick me up today.
1	Waiting for payday a few days away and due to bills being a bit higher then expected having to live off pb and j until pay day. Would love to share a pizza or two with family to have something else on our taste buds til then. Would be more then happy to return the favor after payday, and as much as I hate asking for help would love to lift our spirits up a bit! Thanks in advance!
0	Hey guys. I hate asking for things, but if someone feels like helping a fellow Minnesotan, or a fellow musician, or just wants to be kind to a new member me and my stomach would be infinitely grateful. It hurts to be so hungry.... ONE pizza would probably get me through a week. Been applying for jobs for over a month, still no calls... I've been wanting to go out and apply for some more today, but I'm just so tired and it's hard to even get off the couch without enough energy. Just learned about this site and I think it's a beautiful thing that's happening here. I will surely donate a pizza someday when I have the means. I live in Maplewood, MN... my address can be given if someone would like to get me something. :) Have a good day everyone.
0	I wake up this morning thinking I would be receiving my normal work emails, but to my surprise this was waiting in my inbox. I know work has slowed down, but I didn't think I would be getting the axe. A pizza would sure bring me up from this low blow. I am not picky, any type would be fine with me. Thank you for reading.  Sorry the link didn't show up. I'll try to repost it. [I hope this shows up](http://imgur.com/RqYGw).
0	First, this is a throw away account because I don't want my real life friends reading about this.    My family has gotten by in the past few years through me finding odd jobs and my mothers small income from her job.  It's not much but we get by.    The reason I'm requesting tonight is because my mom decided to take what money we had saved up to buy food for us for thanksgiving and for the next week so that she could buy alcohol, cigarettes, and lottery tickets.  I'm not sure why she did this but it leaves us with very little food for the week.  All I'm asking for is a pizza or two that could feed my family and I for the next two days until I get paid on Wed.  Thanks in advance.
0	im home alone in the basement and i am sick and tired of having to sleep with my grandma cause she smells cause im too tired to change her diaper after my 4 hour shift at blockbuster. And to top it all off i just ran out of kitty litter. So my house smells like poo. I also was just declined to be on the show hoarders because they said just because theres shit all over my house doesnt mean im a hoarder. I just wanna smell pizza for once, not shit.
0	Hi, RAOP. Just as the title says. I'm an unemployed college student and I've been avoiding meals where I can because I can't afford to go out (even to Mickey D's) and we don't even have fruit, vegetables, or snack foods. Little sister is kinda fat and eats everything that doesn't make me gag. Is anyone feeling charitable?
1	Hi, everyone. I'm in college right now and have absolutely no money, and will continue to be broke until I get paid in two weeks. This is my first time posting on RAOP. I'm requesting a pizza not for me, but for my boyfriend. He's absolutely wonderful to me, and right now he's going through a really hard time. His mom is sick. Really sick. And normally in this kind of situation I would make/buy some kind of food for him. Giving food in times of hardship is a kneejerk reaction for me, it's just what I do. But since I can't afford to get him anything at all, I figured I'd give this subreddit a shot. I have no idea what else to do. I'm out of my depth with this. I have no idea what he's going through, so I don't have any idea what to say to make him feel better. But maybe him not having to worry about dinner would help a little bit.  Anyway, thank you for reading this and for your consideration. Sorry I rambled a lot up there.  **EDIT:** Thank you SO FREAKING MUCH, jetboyterp. You are absolutely amazing. I will definitely pay it forward in the future. Thank you!!!!
0	Well, I've been a longtime lurker on this website but I rarely use this account.  After surfing the website for a few minutes I came across this subreddit so now I'm a little curious.  Anyways, I'm not here to conjure up a sob story.  My summer has been pretty busy, between working at an unpaid internship since the beginning of summer and taking an online class to graduate a semester early.  I've been applying for part time jobs since May to earn money and I recently got hired at a restaurant.  Things are looking up, but last night I only got 2-3 hours of sleep and I've never felt this exhausted before.  After seeing this subreddit, I'm craving pizza right now more than anything else.  I hope to return the favor and pay it forward!
0	Hi Redditors, My name is Tom Maxwell and I'm coming to you to ask for a favor. I'm 16-years old and living in Seattle for two months to participate in a summer business program. Long story short, I have $1.86 in my bank account and my parents don't get paid until Saturday (they're paid every other Saturday). What I'd really like is a small pizza to get me through the night, and I'll answer any other questions you may have (within reason, for privacy reasons obviously). Thanks
0	I just arrived back at school after visting my family in Wisconsin over the holidays. Unfortunately while I was there I ran in to some pretty serious car problems and a hefty bill. Paying for my car so I could make it back to school cost everything in my bank account (and a couple hundred dollars my parents were able to help me with ): ). Now I'm at my appartment with nothing to eat and could really use a pie to tide me over untill class starts monday and I get my financial aide. Thanks 
1	I've got about a dollar in my pocket and i haven't eaten today, but I'm getting money soon. So, I just need a meal to get by for tonight. Help would be truly appreciated.  Edit: I have a verification code too.
1	Hey guys, my heater broke down and I won't be able to pay for a new one for at least two months with how work, my classes and such are treating me. It's a harsh world out there, but I'm asking for one extending hand to reach out to me and offer me a hot meal. It'd be great to know that someone cares about your well-being. Thank you if you decided to read    Edit: I'm still very hungry and in need. Please help me out if you can
0	Just ran out of groceries and could use a pizza
0	She's very crabby, very pregnant and all she wants is pizza. She's got two 5 year olds (twins) and a husband, but he doesn't get paid until next week.  If anybody wants to send some pizza her way, let me know. (Let me know how I can verify, and I'll do so.)  Thanks guys!
0	Today is my birthday and I'm looking at $5 to last me until next Thursday. I would be super happy if I could have a tasty meal. : )
0	Just an idea but I was wondering if anyone would be interested in ordering pizza's for the paralyzed veterans at the VA in ST Louis? A lot of the patients are older gentleman with no family and some of them end up staying for months or even years. I saw this reddit and recently [posted a story](http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/up8ap/then_why_the_hell_did_you_give_it_to_me/c4xdiq2) about my roommate in a different sub, saw this sub and made me thank of him.  I was there for 4 months late last year and Remember the sunday dinners where the worst. If you are interested they eat dinner at 5PM CST, so if we ordered at 4PM it should arrive before they get dinner.  Jefferson Barracks SCI unit, Building 52 , St. Louis, MO 63125   (be sure to put a note to deliver to nurses station and say it's for the vets and nurses if you want, the nurses there are pretty awesome and have a thankless job)  If anyone needs the correct numbers to call, let me know. I just thought they would be pleasantly surprised by a bunch of awesome pizza. There are usually about 18 patients but they upgraded the facility so now there are about twice that. At dinner time there are about 6-8 staff (nurses mostly). Anyways I'm going to order one for them also, I would do more but I'm broke and that's all I can afford :(  Edit: several of the nurses there are redditors, forgot to mention that :)
0	I've been left at home all day in order to study for my Trial HSC (end of my last year of school before Uni), and I've found myself with a severe lack of food!  I know it's not the most urgent request, but a pizza would just be absolutely amazing right now, Reddit &lt;3  If it's not possible because I live in Australia, just tell me :P
1	Nope, no sad story, I'm just looking for a pie.  
1	I quit my job because my boss told me I needed to dress more provocatively and wear more makeup to get more tips. I super want a pizza but I am out of money and I'm not having any luck finding a job. I'll draw a picture of whatever if you buy me a pizza :)  [I never said I was an artist](http://i.imgur.com/H03cf.jpg)
0	My fiance and I have eloped here after almost a month and a half of moving from the mid west. Everyone along the way has either been extremely beligerent towards us or unaccepting of the vision we have for ourselves and the world. It has been an especially trying last week as we've spent half of it stuck in first, a Florida airport, then in San Juan. We weren't even sure we were going to make it, if we'd be mugged or what. We're two attractive young (relatively) women. You can imagine the time we've had.  Anyway, we finally have a safe place to crash and would really really appreciate a big pizza, just for the two of us.   Too bad we can't request 420. lol Have a good night and infinite gratitude to those who reply/offer. 
1	I actually don't know what my dad does every weekend but he goes out every Saturday and he forgot to actually buy food for the house. The only thing that's there is his vegetarian food and I'm broker than a joke. :/
0	Well here's the tedious lifestory this morning both my parents left for work, and towards the afternoon i felt famished so i went to get some and i saw i only had Â£5 i though it'd be enough for atleast a burger or something so i tried ordering one but they said it has to be over Â£10 for delivery, and i can't go out as mum took my key :| can anyone feed me with pizza in return i give you ESET NOD32 Anivirus 5 key :D  TL;DR: Â£5 Not enough, buy me pizza get ESET NOD32 Key
0	Studying and stressed for a class I am going to fail anyways, won't be able to graduate on time and moving in 3 days (i.e. no groceries). A pizza would be a comforting thing and a very tasteful distraction.
1	Long story short, my mom and I are currently unemployed (ive been unemployed for 2 months now) and have no food in our house. We just spent the last of our money to pay our electricity bill (after they shut it off) and get dog food. We currently have no gas at our house so its been nothing but cold showers and microwaveable ramen cups for the last month, so a nice warm pizza would sure improve our day. I promise to not only pay the back the person who treats us, but would also repay the favor to another person needing a pizza in the future (after i can get employed) thanks  i forgot to add, we are in naperville (chicago area), IL  thank you sunbear0326 for the pizza! its a great change of pace! &lt;3
0	Payday isn't til next week and when we couldn't get a pizza for my birthday a few days ago he scrapped together the money. Now he is craving a stuffed crust pizza and I can't even scrape together the money to get it for him and the kids...My 10 year old has even offered her $2 she has :( Help! Please!
1	I wish I was making this story up, but unfortunately this has been real life for the last couple of weeks.  My boyfriend and I decided to move into this awesome house because he's going back to school and it makes his commute significantly shorter.  Our new landlord is awesome and told us, since the house is already empty, we could start moving our stuff a couple weeks early so that it makes our move easier, awesome right? So, last Monday comes along and I decide to give her a call.  She doesn't answer so I leave a message, no answer.  Tuesday comes and still no call back.  I have to go to Portland that weekend for a baby shower and my Aunt's birthday party, come back Sunday and still no call back.  She calls me this Monday and tells me cheerfully they've been at the beach all week. I pick up the keys later that day and I've been moving car loads of stuff between work.  We planned on moving today since the beginning of the month, so I scheduled this particular carpet cleaner that our current landlord says we have to use for Thursday (he's very popular in town so there's no way to reschedule). So then, last night as I'm cleaning our place and getting ready for the move, our current landlord rings our doorbell.  She tells me that they are "resealing" our road tomorrow and that the road will be completely closed to our driveway from 6AM-6PM.  I start to panic so she gives me the phone number of the guy who is in charge of this project.  I give him a call and he is a TOTAL jerk about it.  At first I was trying to be polite to him in an effort to have him help me out, but I soon realized he wasn't going to help me out (or even apologize for that matter).  Now we can't even start moving until 6PM tonight, which is sort of a nightmare because my brother and his wife are helping us move and I feel pretty guilty about making them move that late.  I've spent a lot of my time (and not to mention expenses) on this move and I am pretty stressed and frustrated.  If someone would send a pizza to our new place it would make me (and I'm sure my brother...he loves pizza) the happiest mover that has ever walked the planet!
0	Me and my fiancee have been spending a lot recently combining Arbitrary day, cleaning supplies, steam sale, and just being really busy as of late.. so if someone could toss a pizza our way it would be much appreciated.  As compensation, you can appear as a background character in my webcomic [Antihero for Hire](http://antihero.keenspot.com), possibly running away from some sort of monster or other.  And we'll be sure to pay it forward when we get paid next!
0	So last night at my NYE party, some people my friends brought knocked over my soup I had made to last all week while trying to cram more beer into the fridge, it sucked. It was some kickass recipe I found on r/dollarfriendlymeals.  http://www.dollarfriendlymeals.com/post/13700973183/turkey-dumpling-soup  So that blew, also they didn't even eat most of what I had left out for munching. People suck sometimes. If you feel like hooking up Mr. Wexler with some Za, I would appreciate it, Brah.  Get it? Za Brah.  I apologize for that last part.
0	Hello. i'm an artist out of washington state. i make art on postal stickers, screenprints, paper (hand-drawn), and digital photoshopery.   I'm willing to exchange pizza for art.   20bux worth of dominos pizza gets you: 8 postal stickers 1 screen print or 1 logo(this one may come later) 4 hand drawn pieces (i use crayon and sharpie like a champ).  more than 20 bux in pizza=more art  whether you like the art or not is not up for me. if you like to sample my damn fine works, you may find them at drobotart.com  thanks cool people.
0	I had to move out of my home last week, I'm staying at my office until I can get back on my feet. (Throwaway because my boss is a Redditor and he doesn't know I'm staying here.)  My bank account has ran dry due to catching up on bills. I don't get paid until Saturday. I will pay it forward once I get paid, and I will even use my main account to do it!  Anything will help.
1	I'm broke until Thursday and pretty hungry. Any pizza received will be paid forward, promise. I'm located in Dublin, Ireland.   Using a throwaway account because I'm ashamed.   http://www.just-eat.ie/
1	Car won't start and I need my car for work to feed my kids. I'm broke with no food in the house until payday. A pizza would be perfect for them until I can make further moves later this week. I will definitely pay the favor back.
0	Graduate Student, Stuck at school all day, classes at night, just hungry and want a pizza if one would be so kind.  Thanks.
0	I am a stay at home mom of two kids i live with my husband his parents and my kids! The only reason that I am unemployed is because my husband was hit by a drunk driver a little over a year ago and was seriously injured and was almost killed! so i quit work to help him through recovery and take care of the kids while living with my in-laws off of their ssi checks (which are tiny)! Its the end of the month and we're broke! We are not starving but we aren't eating all that well either! Please be my pizza hero!
0	A pizza would give me a couple of days' worth of food that's a little different than what I've been eating for the last few months. I'll do whatever verification is necessary.
0	Hey RAoP, I had court today.  I got my second minor about a week ago and I feel like shit.  I had court, and the judge ordered me 500 dollars in fines and 40 hours community service.  I'm a pretty good kid, but I like to party and drink, and I got pulled over biking home from a party.  I'm living in a house, I'm a sophomore @ NDSU. I don't feel like cooking anything.  Been cruising Reddit for about 5 hours now.  Oh yeah, missed a calc quiz and my TA won't let me reschedule, she said that court wasn't an acceptable excuse. So I'm starting Calc 1 with a zero.  Thanks guys.  EDIT: Fargo
0	There's 12 of us total, just got back from an outing, and we can't find our Dominos coupons. Today's our last day to be with friends before we leave, and would like to have a good meal, hang out and relax. Any and all help would be greatly appreciated. 
0	So I'm in NYC from Boston and I tried to use my card to buy a train ticket so I can get to my friends apt. He won't be home until tomorrow. My card was denied and when I checked my account it turns out I'm in the red because loans and bills came through. I get payed Wednesday(direct deposit) but I'm just looking for a meal to survive tonight and tomorrow. I haven't eaten since lunch yesterday please help!  And in case anyone is wondering Times Square is lovely right now. Still amazed that I'm here. It's my first time!
0	Been eating Ramen and mac n cheese for the past 3 weeks , im not sure if its good for me but i would like something else. Im looking for a job and have been for 2 months so all the money i get has to go to bills and rent.  Some pizza would be awesome right about now.
0	I've been job hunting for three months now, this was meant to be my first summer living away from home but it's all gone wrong, I'm exhausted and a bit scared of what's going to happen. I'm blessed to be able to do enough cash in hand jobs to keep the rent people happy but right now I'm wishing for nothing more than a disk of dough with some cheese ontop.  Much love, good luck to any of you who might be trying to find a job in this crazy market atm.   EDIT: No word from Gaga :( any still looking gentle anons.   EDIT EDIT: I have no idea what "any still looking" means.   EDIT EDIT EDIT: I lovely young gentleman has brought up the subject of my account only being two months old, this would be a good point if it weren't for the fact that more than two seconds on my account shows I have been using my account for a lot of posts etc and this is actually my first time posting on this sub.
0	Lost my Job three months ago. Since then I've bought nothing but pasta. I got told today that all I need to do is go down tomorrow to fill out paperwork to get setup, but today I have 3 dollars in my bank. Anyone wanna buy a pizza for a guy to celebrate with something other than water and beef top ramen since I won't be paid for another 3 weeks yet?
0	Hello!  Just your average starving comp sci major. I am rather skilled in photoshop and corel draw though, and will draw or shop whatever you like, my dear pizza champion. You want a cool space desktop background? You got it. You want to ponify yourself? I can do that. You want George Washington leading a bunch of space marines? Man you really want me to work for it, don't you? I'll do it!  Thanks for reading.
0	This was my favorite short term promotion and its back! I don't have the money otherwise I would buy it myself. Thanks for reading my post and have an awesome day!
0	IN A NUTSHELL, MY WIFE was prescribed Vistaril for anxiety attacks. Due to extreme stress she suffered one yesterday and now she is resting. Because of extra hardships this month our fridge and cabinets are getting very empty and I am NOT the whiz in the kitchen that my wife is. I have fed my children peanut butter and jelly for two days and now we are out of bread, I would LOVE to treat them to a few pizzas, yet my wallet cannot afford it at this time... We saw a pizza hut commercial for the big box pizzas and my 6 year old begged me for a pizza. It broke my heart to tell her we didn't have the money for it... when my 4 year old piped up that we can just go to walmart and get some money ha ha! So here is my request, if there is anyone who can get us 2 big box pizzas (one sausage and one cheese) from Pizza hut in Harrison Arkansas.. (phone number is 870-743-3500) I can pickup from there no problem. I will recieve VA education benefits on the 6th and can pay it forward on that day. From the bottom of my heart and from the pit of my childrens stomachs (not having to suffer through my sad attempt at cooking a meal) THANKS to anyone who can help us!
0	No sad story, just wanted to try for a random pizza.  Thank you!!
0	Just closed down my store laying in bed, broke, in debt, thinking of what to do next, starving...would love a pizza...thx guys
1	If anyone can help at all, I'd appreciate it more than you can imagine.  Edit: spelling error.
0	I'm staying at college for most of winter break to work. I haven't gotten my paycheck yet because of a coworkers error in submitting timesheets. I currently have $0.03 in my bank account. I'd much rather enjoy pizza that will last a couple of days instead of ramen again. Thanks!
0	Just had a baby and had to move in with my mother after losing my job at the school that I'm not going to anymore in Daytona. Money is nonexistent as I haven't found a job yet(Waiting for training at Best Buy) but I just thought I'd put out a request on here for a Pizza Hut Pizolo. Thanks a ton and hope you all are having a good day :) 
0	I do have verification code btw!
0	I'm living with my ex boyfriend, as he works in a factory third shift and can't take care of the baby but wants to live with her. His brother lives with us because his mom is a dangerous person and has nowhere else to go. He got laid off five months ago, when our baby was born, and because his employer didn't do paperwork, we were only eligable for one month of food stamps.   He went back to work not too long ago, and when our lease was up, we could barely afford a new apartment. I was also just diagnosed with depression, and my medicine is another thing we have to worry about. Our situation is very overwhelming to me, and I don't know how we're going to get through this.   I wouldn't do this if I knew we would be okay, we have doctors appointments that are coming up, medicine to buy, food, rent, bills, tons of other things that are stressing us out, and when I found this, I could breathe a sigh of relief. Please help us have a night where we don't have to worry so much, and I can repay you in cute baby pictures. :)
1	today we found out wells fargo screwed me so hard.  $1800 hard.  :/ now we both are extremely broke and havent even ate today.  so, if anyone were willing to get us a pizza we would forever love you.  we'll give a video of thanks as well! :) 
0	i was driving on the highway when the driver behind me lost control of his f150, as i was slowing down to get off the exit, all i hear is a lound shriek, and everything turned black. i woke up, looked around and was just amazed at how i was still alive. anyway i dont have a car anymore, lucky to be alive. THe other driver was ok too. Anyway i would appreciate anyone from the reddit community who would like to help cheer me up with a slice...or two.  PIC: http://imgur.com/NN4BR
0	Anyone can help me out? I'm broke currently and I would get you reddit gold or pizza tommorrow with my tips.
0	I have posted this in what I thought was this subreddit, but it seemed to be an offshoot that's not active (?) it's also at r/randomactsofpizza  if one gets fullfilled i'll make sure to notifiy the other subreddit. I'm in need to last me the next few days.  If I've done anything wrong let me know.  EDIT: If need be, I can and will write a poem about anything you ask.
0	I could give you some sob story, but really I'm just poor and hungry. but welcome to my life as a broke college student. 
0	I will be moving out of town soon, and this is one of the last days that I'll be able to hang out with my amazing group of friends here in Tallahassee. We're all broke at the moment, and moving isn't cheap. A pizza would be a great "last meal" for us.  I will repay someone in need when I can afford it.  Thanks for your time
0	In Wilmington, North Carolina. Like I said still haven't been able to find a job and last night I ate the last of my peanut butter, pretty much the only thing I have to eat until the end of the week. Help please!?
0	Nothing to cry over just really craving that pizza right now...
1	Here's a post about the break-in: http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1cjhxc/heres_my_brave_dog_dumbledore_hes_four_years_old/  Thanks if you can help in any way! I was looking at a few of the request threads, and when I saw the pizza it started a craving I guess :) you guys do amazing work!  I get off at 4:30pm EST so I don't know if there's a way to pre-schedule them or something? And I can pick it up as well to save extra costs!
0	Heyall, basically title says it all. I'm bored, at home, in my basement with very bad internet for the moment. A pizza would really amuse me :P  General location : Massachussets (specifically Eastern MA)
0	I tried to do an askreddit a while back about a friend who faces time. It didn't do well so I deleted it. I guess that explains my user name.  I heard about this reddit through the same friend that introduced me to this reddit site.  I have some pics of my place. I don't do so well. My friend said I should use imgur.com.  Edit: I read on sidebar. I am in US but my first language is not English.  Edit: Oh yeah. I could use a pizza!
0	Dad went on a business trip and left us with twenty dollars for the week along with some food. We have ran out of both the night before and we are hungry. Any help would be appreciated.
1	A pizza would literally keep me fed for 2 or so days, and would be a literal godsend.  I have no system to really make sure I can eat tomorrow, and emergency foodstamps take up to 7 days in my state.  Anything anyone can do would be greatly appreciated :)
0	Facing financial issues and been scraping along for food haha. Pizza sounds awesome right about now. I'm airborne infantry with the 82nd. My hobby is art. So if you want a "screen saver" I'm your man hahahaha. The pizza places here in Fayetteville are open 24 hrs and accept credit over the phone ^^ feeeeeed me nom nom nom
0	I will give you my full-length avant garde album for a pizza, because I am starving and poor.  Boston area  http://humanzeemusic.bandcamp.com/
1	Today I am working as a supervisor with my favorite employees, and I would like to reward them with a pizza. Any help would be welcome. Thanks!
0	Currently very little food in the house things went bad this month for my family, both parents don't get paid till Monday, and currently i'm in college living with them. Would be great if anyone would be willing to make mine and my family's weekend with some yummy pizza.
0	This is for me &amp; the wife. I'll pass (play?) it forward on payday (20/9) too. Thanks for swinging by.
0	Had a rough weekend, just found this subreddit and want to see if it works! If anybody sends me pizza I will deffinately return the favor haha I live just outside St. Paul MN 
0	I'm just very poor right now and very hungry, a pizza could get me a few days till payday. I'd be happy to repay the favor on Wednesday!
0	Hi everyone I am on here in hopes to getting a pizza my hubby just got home from work and we are both broke till tomorrow.and we are pretty empty on food in our home.would be nice to have a nice hot pizza for our late dinner pls.Thanks ...

0	pleaaase?
0	Looking for some pizza tonight, will send out two pizza's to lovely redditors come my paycheck Friday. Had to use my last paycheck to pay off rent, getting sick of potatoes and butter.
0	Back in late may, I ran into a pot hole with my bike. I hit the pavement face-first and lost some teeth/ broke my jaw. From june 6th to July 6th, I had my jaw tightly wired shut, and subsisted on smoothies, red lentils, and pudding. My jaw has been unwired, but I still have a bunch of dental bills to look forward to that I don't know if I can pay. Help me forget about the bills, and celebrate some pizza.  Proof:   [Me before, pretty average awesome smile](http://i.imgur.com/9U9v9.jpg)   [Me right after getting out of the hospital](http://i.imgur.com/Fmlzw.jpg)  [Murder hillbilly](http://i.imgur.com/QDlMc.jpg)
0	Well I am in louisville and I am broke right now and My friend told me about this site that u all help with pizza .I am very hungry and have nothing right now .I am a part time worker at a warehouse and I dont get paid until monday and my bills took all my money I had.Just seeing if anyone could help with some pizza tonight for me so I am not hungry thanks
1	I just got hired on as a member of Geek Squad at Best Buy, however I have to wait two weeks for my first check! My roommate and I are low on funds until tomorrow, any chance we could get some assistance today, and then Tag my post I will give with a pie with my first check! 
1	My fiancee and I have been spending all day organizing my father's house after he passed away a few weeks ago.  It's been a lot harder than I thought it would be.  We only have $2.27 in our bank account until I get paid on Tuesday, and it would be really nice to not have to heat up ANOTHER Cup O' Noodles tonight, and instead be able to relax and chow down on some deliciousness.
0	[EDIT] I live in Mesa, AZ 85201 &lt;- thanks to [alliOops](http://www.reddit.com/user/alliOops) for the heads up!  I know there are guys worse off than me, so for what I have I am grateful. I have food, just haven't had pizza in too damn long...  So, here's where I'm at: I got fired because my boss found out I disproved of his business ethics, and then denied my unemployment. I have $3 to my name, and if I had $5 I'd get a Little Ceaser's pizza.  I don't care if it's just cheese or what - I'm not picky. Would just love some pizza right about now. I could go on about more crap-stuff in my life, but I don't like thinking about it.
0	I will certainly repay the favor when I get paid (:
0	Been a rough few days with work and my personal life. Cell phone bill overdrew my account last night, had to borrow some money to get it back positive and be able to buy my bus tokens to get to work. Will pay it forward as soon as I'm able to.  Located in Northeast Philadelphia, can offer whatever verification needed.
0	hi im a 45 yr disabled mom and grandma living on my ssi check , i do not get my fs til the 4th of october my check goes completely to bills any help with  a pizza request would be so appreciated im new on here ,we are a family of  3 adults and a teenager and am 8 yr.old  im in lowell massachusetts
0	My sister's boyfriend bought me a $400 computer last week, and he took it home to put it together, install os, drivers, etc..  Well little did he know, ALL OF HIS ROOM MATES (except my sister, of course) WOULD JUST DIP OUT.  Now they're stuck splitting $1200 in rent, not including utilities, and they don't have any money for food. They literally have zero food in their home.  They would have plenty of money if he hadn't loaned me money for the computer..  I get paid in a few days, and I'm going to pay him back ASAP.  Reddit, I beg you. Help a brotha out.
0	Im between jobs and spent the last of my money on my medication. Im uninsured so it robbed me broke. I will return the favor on the 16th, it's my next paycheck. Or I also start a job tomorrow, so possibly with tips if they don't drag my training on. I. Am. Starving. First time here so im not one hundred how it works. 
0	My location is Dublin, Ireland. 
0	I don't have a sob story. I'm hungry as hell and would really love the taste of pizza. I WILL pay it forward, post a picture, verify my email. what ever you would like to do. Please and thank you!
0	I was absolutely starving so I ate my fiancee's burrito that he had in the fridge (and yes it was amazing). He is asleep right now and doesn't know it yet. Maybe waking up to pizza would make him forget about burrito? 
0	Well, my super awesome wiener dog hurt his back pretty bad a few weeks ago and the vet bills have pretty much wiped me out. I have some ramen laying around but I sure would love an actual meal. I'll gladly pay it forward this friday when I get paid. Thank you so much in advance!
0	After a tiring two-weeks, including an ambulance ride for one kid, a hospitalization (she's okay now), 1 with a head ache (she's only 4, and has cluster head aches), and 1 that's home schooled due to bullies (Autism). This mommy is TIRED and could use a pizza night! We can't afford it right now. I'll make it up to you guys and pay it forward when things are not so crazy around here!   Also, for verification of the medical stuff I can forward you to our facebook page for our kids medical updates, I just don't want to post it publicly.   Thanks in advance! 
1	I was invited to Reddit after playing checkers on Yahoo. I told the person that I was playing that I was craving a pizza, but didn't have any money to buy one. They suggested that I try my luck here. I've been eating rice and beans for about a week and while I shouldn't complain, it is getting old. A nice Hawaiian pizza would be more than enough for the wife and I. Something different to lift our spirits. Happy New Years from North Carolina!
1	I've locked myself away and am zealously working on several sites for a client demo this Tuesday. Za' would be greatly appreciated and fuel my desire through this stressful day.
0	After paying rent this month, we are both short on money and grocery funds have been cut dramatically. If we eat anymore ramen we might go insane. We would be greatly appreciative if anyone could help us out! Thanks!
1	Don't want to get all bluh bluh with my personal situation, but.  tl;dr, got laid off recently and cash is tight like spandex at the gym.  Things lately have kind of felt like this:  http://i.imgur.com/mimsY.gif  I'm in Redmond, just added Seattle since some people aren't familiar with the area.  Pizza Hut or Papa John's preferred.  [edit:] Request closed!   Massive thanks to puppeteer107 for being so generous.
0	So here's the micro story: lost my job in Florida, moved back up near family in Wisconsin and into a motel, had to changed to an even cheaper motel so now living in Rockford, IL. I'm now away from family, no friends, and yesterday my car broke down. I am a freelance web developer, so thankfully I can do my work as long as I have internet. But finding work is another story.   I have 89 cents to my name until who-knows-when. Unfortunately where I live, there are no places that deliver. Since my car's broken, I'm not sure I could even do pizza. I was thinking, if I could find the cash, I would walk to the nearest gas station and stock up on pasta-type stuff.   So if anyone out there is willing to help, I would be so very much appreciative. If you have questions on anything, feel free to ask. I have verification as well.   Thank you everyone for your consideration.
0	We have no plans or money tonight and would really appreciate some pizza right now. Thanks RAoP :)
0	Okay, so me and my roommate are in a sticky situation. We both don't get paid until Thursday, and we haven't eaten all day. We also don't have much food left in the house, just chips and snacky stuff. My mom cant help me with money until tomorrow night and her parents don't even live close to us. A Egift card for pizza would work wonders right now.  - i posted this already just a few minutes ago but i cant see it for some reason, so im posting it again to see if it works
1	Well, you probably have read similar posts already. Still I have to try.  So situation is this: I had sort of a big fight with my parents who up until a two month ago helped me financially out while I am studying for my bachelor degree. Well coming this month the fees were due and while I sort of managed to pay them I now have a three digits debt on my account. And this is the start of the month.  I have good chances (okok... let's say medium chances) on getting a part time job beginning of November but this doesn't really help for now.   I am though a hobbyist digital artist. This is my deviantart profile: http://shadom86.deviantart.com/ While I can't promise anything, I might be able to make a picture for you. Providing you want me to.  Anyway? Anyone out there who feels very generous?  
0	Avid pizza fan, would LOVE a pie. Thanks in advance kind people!
1	Lost my job and im a bit broke. I live paycheck to paycheck and will pickup my last check next Wednesday. That will get me enough food to last a month. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I will pay it forward once im back on my feet.  Thanks for reading!
0	Reposting this hoping we might end up with some food..  ...in the middle of Ohio.  As the bucket of pennies suggests we're particularly broke and warm food is hard to come. We're not getting paid until mid-February (and some of us are still looking for work). We'd greatly appreciate any help.. and a warm pizza would be great.  On our way we just passed a Chinese place and missed the lunch special (only affordable thing) by a couple of minutes so the possibility of warm food is still too real in our minds.  
1	My friend is visiting from out of town, travelled through snow to celebrate new years together and visit Monk (the cat).  We're broke and happy but also hungry right now! We would be grateful for a little help to make this a happier (and less hungry) new years eve!  Will post pictures of the Monk enjoying the pizza. 
0	Just 3 college age kids who don't get paid for another week, contrary to what we were told by our boss Edit: Sorry for no location, we are in Michigan
0	haven't had stuffed crust pizza in ages and after paying rent, car insurance, and paying off my credit card i don't have tons of money available for such luxuries.  i have a verification code, so if you feel like being generous i can send that to you.  thanks!
1	Hello! I come to this site looking for a little help getting through a little bit of a tough time. I'm just getting over being sick as a dog. Shingles aren't pretty. I had a few sick days, but I was out for a bit longer than I thought I'd be, so my check is going to be a little short. A pizza dinner would be great. This isn't a real need, but my expecting wife has been craving pizza and my son is doing really well in school. We are a small family and don't need much. We'll pay it back when I can catch up in a few weeks.  Thank you!
0	After a 3 months of joblessness I have finally found a steady position at IdeoMed. The company makes iOS apps that remind kids to take their asthma medication on time and alerts doctors when an asthma attack is recorded.  Sadly I am still broke until January rolls through: [http://i.imgur.com/hxjxG.png](http://i.imgur.com/hxjxG.png)  A pizza would be awesome and I would love to return the favor on my first paycheck.  I'd be happy to help anyone on /r/csshelp too :) My portfolio website lists everything I know: [http://ericwright.me](http://ericwright.me)  Thank you!
0	I'm sick of eating pizza with tomatoes and green peppers or just a plain cheese pizza. I want meat back in my life... Like Bacon, pepperoni... basically a meat lovers pizza. I miss them so much &lt;/3
0	It's been nearly 3 days without a proper meal. I'd really appreciate it if somebody could provide me with a pizza, and I can promise that Monday (when I finally receive some money) I will be helping another user :).  I don't care what food really, I'm just starving right now. 
1	So I'm a broke college student (big surprise!) who couldn't go home for Thanksgiving. All my housemates went home, and all my friends went home as well/had other plans, so it looks like I'm spending the next 4 days alone. I would really appreciate not having to eat mac&amp;cheese for the umpteenth time, especially on this day.
1	GW girls like pizza too...no sob story, just a desire to have some pizza and wings tonight in the Vegas area. :) Special thanks and pics for whomever can help. ;)
0	Hey  My girlfriend and I have been sick all week( stomach bug)   We would love a pizza as we don't really have the energy to cook right now. Or the funds to order.  It would be really helpful, would order forward or return the favour after pay day.    Thanks for reading  Edit:  No longer needed, my brother turned up with a pizza and a few beers :) thanks anyway guys! 
1	It's been a rough couple of days. Didn't get my paycheck before labor day like I was supposed to, won't get it until sometime tomorrow if I'm lucky. They also cut my hours in half at an already part time job. Found out that my childhood home in Bastrop burnt down, here's my [Facebook Post](http://imgur.com/OMho5) about it.  I'm hungry, I'm out of cigs, and generally stressed out about everything. Just would like a pizza to help make it til tomorrow.  
0	IDC what kinda of food or from where. Im just really fuckin hungry.   Car broke down last week.  have about $1.45 and Im new to L.A. and I don't know anyone.  Can some one help a fellow brother out.
0	Roommate and I are very poor, and also drunk off of jug wine. Very Hungary too. Help a brotha out?
0	I have been unemployed for a year and I would like to treat my two boys to something besides top roman or food bank food.  Just a little help would be great.  Bless everyone and happy 4th of July!
0	I'm currently unemployed and a full time nursing student, going to school with my sister. We both come from a poor family, we have no help from our parents, but we try and support each other. We're running low on food and we could use a nice hot meal.  Just for full disclosure, my sister and I have received pizza from RAOP about 4 or 5 months ago. All we have in the house is rice and beans, so any pizza with a lot of veggies would be nice.  Thank you.   Also, here is proof of my lack of money: http://i.imgur.com/yPF5KMX.png
0	Hey guys, so my little sister is upset as her friend tired to commit suicide and is in a coma.. i want to get her a pizza but i'm poor as hell, anyone able to do that?  we live in the UK, surrey area!  thank you..
0	Hey Reddit, looks like my family (me, wife, 3 kiddos) have to move house ASAP -- our landlord was foreclosed upon. We're handling the temporal stuff as best we can, but we sure could use some comfort pizza to help us out sometime in the next few days. We could even use the pizza boxes for packing! :-)  Thanks in advance, will definitely pizza it forward once things settle down here.
0	Hi all.    LOL....I've been staring at this page for quite a while trying to get up the nerve to ask for a pizza.  I wrote it once, went to get the verification code as it stated I should and came back to find I have to start from scratch!  Yes, newcomer, stands out bright and clear, I'm sure, lol.  O.K.    I had only recently been back to work.  Hours and paychecks have been small but workable.  However, I have had to say "no" so many times to family that I would like to offer a "yes" for a change.  If anyone can help, I would be able to pay it forward in a week, or repay giver.  Whichever works here.  Thank you.  :) 
0	Hi,   I just moved back to Bloomington after spending the last year taking care of my mother who was suffering from brain cancer. Sadly, she passed away last month, but thankfully is no longer suffering.   I've been back for about 3 weeks and have been having a very hard time finding work. I assume because it is a college town and during the summer many businesses are cutting staff and hours till the students come back in the fall.  I am working hard to get my life back in order after the loss of my mother and would appreciate from the bottom of my heart if someone was willing to donate a pizza for me to have tonight. My income has been extremely limited since helping to pay for funeral cost, my apartment's deposit and first month of rent, and bills, so any food is a blessing. I promise I will pay this act of kindness forward at my very first chance.  Thank you so much for reading and take care!
0	Currently on my last 12 hour night shift and finish at 08:00AM, I've forgotten my lunch and it will be a long night being hungry all night. I was hoping that a pizza would be able to soften the blow and fill a hole!
0	Sad girls seek pizza in Southeast Masachusetts!  My best friend is letting me stay at her house for a couple days due to a mild case of homelessness, and we have a lot of feelings. We want to watch Mean Girls and bond because she misses her boyfriend (a doctor stationed in OK), and we're really hungry, too! She has a dollar to her name, and my boss from my summer job owes me $1,500 - of which I've received nothing.  A little boost in the form of Domino's would be SO appreciated and I'll be sure to pass on the favor as soon as I can!  EDIT: I'm not a woman (well, girl?) of many talents, but if you want, I'll sing for you or draw a picture or write you a story. I can't promise they will be awesome, but I will try! Anything for my friend's happiness/ pizza. :)  Love,  Lemon &amp; Cleo
1	Well, my rent is paid up until June, and [my cats](http://i.imgur.com/T7pmOh.jpg) have food. I just ate my last package of ramen, and I forgot to save some cash for me to eat!  I by no means need or deserve a pizza. I couldâve planned out my spending a little better. [My fridge is empty](http://i.imgur.com/IXViD.jpg), but I do have some pasta or rice I could make.  Getting a pizza would be the highlight of my spring break. And when I get paid on Friday, I would love to pay it forward.  [Pizza received!](http://imgur.com/Phh2e) (4:51 PM CDT) Thank you, Your_Never_Alone!! 
0	I made a request yesterday and sadly I got no response. Unfortunately I am still out of food and was hoping today I would have better luck. Here is the original thread I started http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/i6oek/requestran_out_of_food_please_help/  Any help would be awesome. 
0	Our landlord is trying to evict us. The electric company just stopped by to let us know we owe them money, too. We've been at the welfare office every day for the last week, trying to get things going. I will definetly pay it forward when I can.
0	I ate a part of a left over salad last night and I haven't eaten anything since. I will continue to be in this situation until I can be able to take the money I work hard for to set some aside to put a little bit of groceries in my home of 7 people. I am one of 3 people working to pay bills so that there is electricity in it and a working phone, ect. I have no where else to turn and I am in need of help. I hate feeling this desperate and could use a helping hand this once. thank you.
0	First time ever on here, would love any pizza please, very hungry with the munchies
0	hey! so i'm hoping someone can help this college student from the north shore of Massachusetts that just returned home to a family with far greater concerns than sticking pizza down my throat. I'm looking for jobs but no luck, per usual, and i'm hoping someone on here is willing to give me something to put in the win column seeing as it's been a while since I've been able to do so.  My email is 5yardfacemask@gmail.com  Thanks for existing everyone that is in this community :)
0	I homeschool my kids and they have a day off today. I call it a Mom in service day. Anyway, I would love to treat them to a pizza lunch but lack the funds to do so. A pizza lunch from a kind redditor would be great. Thanks if you can help.
0	I'm planning a surprise party for my bestie, and spent money on ordering things and prep, and forgot to budget (too focused on birthday!) for my eating. Oops! Having a pizza would be a wonderful way to unwind from my now-done planning, and I'll be able to pay it forward on Monday, because pizza is the best! 
0	I hope I'm doing this right. I waited before posting, because I thought I would have money for food tonight. I tried selling some textbooks on Craigslist, but the person who wanted to buy them never showed up. The money I was going to get from my textbooks was going to be used for food for the week. I am completely out of food and very hungry. One pizza would be enough to get me through tonight, and hopefully I'll be able to get these books sold tomorrow.
1	My mom's been ill lately and we don't really have any food.. we have rice but that's about it, I get paid in about a week (just got my first job, i'm 18) but something to hold us over until then would be nice :) 
0	It's been pretty hard this past month food wise, and for the past two weeks I've eaten maybe one meal a day, and the term meal is loosely used. It'd be really nice if someone could bring in the new year on a positive note for me. I'm open for paying back however you choose, or not at all, it's entirely up to your discretion. 
0	I've had to make some sacrifices this last month to save my business and I'm at the end of the line. All the ramen is gone. It sounds like a client will make us whole tomorrow but I've been living on iced tea and bullion cubes for a couple days. Help me out with a pie y'all. It would mean a lot.
0	Hello, everyone! I'm new to this website. I was chatting with someone on a different website about how it totally sucks when you're really hungry and someone calls you up telling you all about the awesome food they just made. It ended up turning into a talk about how I've only got enough food in the house for my little one to eat until Saturday (which is when my food stamps refresh). So they linked me here! I didn't even know that something like this existed, it is amazing~  I've got to work tonight at 5, but my place of employment is right next to a Dominos, so carry out would be the best option, if anyone is feeling generous today. I'd really appreciate it!  Thanks for reading!
0	So we've all heard about what those horrible kids did to Karen. If you haven't you can find out [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l93wAqnPQwk&amp;feature=watch_response_rev)  I don't want to post Karen's address here, but that video has been getting spammed with the involved parties contact info for hours now.  How awesome would it be for her to be greeted by pizza and sympathy notes this morning?  I know I could have asked for this in a better way. But I just really suck at asking for things.
0	I have about $2.47 in my bank account because I just paid all my bills, rent, and other school expenses today. It's getting late here, but I have some more studying to do. Would love some pizza to keep my energy up.   If anyone can help, that would be excellent. 
0	Hello! As the title says, I'm just a college student, no sob story unless you count being perpetually broke. I had an evening class tonight that doesn't let out until after all the dining halls close, so I'm not starving, just craving some cheesy goodness.   I've never requested pizza before so I feel a little weird about it, but I thought it couldn't hurt. Eventually I'd like to be on the other side of things giving the pizza, maybe during the summer when I tend to have a little more available funds.   I also feel weird about being such an anonymous face behind a computer screen so here are a few facts about me!   * I'm studying criminal justice and psychology and hoping to go to law school if I ever get out of undergrad.  * I really like Doctor Who, Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, etc. (you know, all the good shows :] )  * I love to read. My current book is Stephen King's Night Shift.  * I'm absolutely terrible at talking about myself so the facts end here.  If anyone is gracious enough to grant me a pizza, they have my sincere thanks in advance. Maybe I could doodle you a pokemon or something.
0	Hey guys i got into a car wreck month ago. I was driving though an intersection(My green light) when a speeding taxi who needed to get his fare to the airport at 6am in the morning.  I Span in the work van, im not sure how many times but the location of my work van showed that i had spun a 360 at least once.   I haven't been able to work since due to my injury. I have filed a claim, and they have accepted it... I Just don't have that cheque yet and my bank account gets smaller everyday.   Im just a 20y dude who is cravin some pizza with no means to the finish line. 
0	All out of bread for PB&amp;J. I get paid on Friday. Can anyone help me out? I'm going to basically just starve until Thursday Midnight. Help hold me over please.
0	My family has been strapped for cash for a few weeks now and have been kind of scraping for our necessities. Today we don't have enough money for any food today and what we have been eating isn't exactly top tier. Could probably go today but would really appreciate some pizza.
0	Yo.  So I'm about to move across the country (Florida to Pennsylvania) with my girlfriend, and I just paid the deposit on the new place, first month's rent, and the pro-rate for my current apartment, so I've been stretched ramen-thin for a week and a half or so. I don't get paid 'till Friday, and a pizza would be pretty sweet.   Not gonna lie; I won't starve if I don't get one, but it's been a pretty stressful week, and it'd help the ol' morale. I've done the verification system and such.  Thanks!
0	I am in the Los Angeles area and in need of some food.  I have no money until Thursday when my SSI check comes in.  Send me a PM and we'll work something out.
0	me and my family struggle every day to eat because of the economy we were forced to all move together 5 of us in a two bed room apt it would be nice to have something good to eat and to have a day off from the worry of what we are going to eat today 
1	My wife and I are broke right now due to bills and having a 6 month old (kids are expensive), she's air force and deploys to South Korea for a year next month, and it took all our extra money preparing everything and we've been scraping meals together, pretty much only have ramen and canned fruit right now. A pizza, even a cheap simple one, would really be awesome right now, and I promise next pay day I'll pizza someone in return to forward the favor. If no one replies I completely get it! I can provide some kind of proof if requested. Thanks everyone!
1	The title pretty much says it all. I start working at my new job this upcoming week and am completely broke until then. My power has been cut off so I can't even cook things on a stovetop.  The neighbors in the apartment next to me have been kind enough to let me run an extension cable from one of their wall outlets near the door to a power strip in the living room so I can set up my computer (was putting in applications), lamp, and charge my phone.  Shit's rough and I'd just like a pizza or two I can live off of for a couple days or half week.
0	The tl;dr of the situation is that I haven't been paid in a couple of weeks and my roomate and I are craving pizza. I am willing to repay in the form of baked goods. Thank you!!
0	Anything in Madison, WI
1	First, i want to say WOW! I had no idea something like this existed. I've helped people on the street with meals before but this is something beautifully different.   I am a young woman living with my longtime boyfriend and like a lot of people, times are tough. I had a temporary lay off with my job that i just went back to but wont be receiving a paycheck until next Friday. My boyfriend wont be paid from his work until the 6th. Had dental work done recently that took about 190 bucks to fix my teeth. I used my last can of chili beans and mixed it with white rice last night for dinner. Many nights we go without dinner(sometimes i survive on cups of coffee all day) but we never lose sight that things will get better for us eventually. We are in the middle class rut; don't make enough to survive comfortably in California but are making too much money for food assistance. It leaved us caught in a limbo. Ive been to a local food pantry once before and yes, it was hard to keep your chin up and have that pride when you are asking for help from someone.   It seems easier to ask for help if its done semi-anonymously as I don't have to shamefully look anyone in the eye who may judge me. I would love a pizza for dinner and with the leftovers, eat for breakfast and lunch. We live in Union City, California in the shadows of both the great Silicon Valley and the San Fransisco Bay. Right smack in the middle where apartments are tiny but cost you an arm and a leg to live there.   Thank you guys for taking the time to create such a wonderful service to help your fellow man. I WILL be paying it forward when i get on my feet, if only a simple pie to a struggling family.   email me at l0serl0ve7@gmail.com if you could help us. If you need proof of something lemme know, i can screenshot my dentist check that cleared or my negative account balance. Thanks again.   -Leilani Love
0	Hi.  So, I'm broke, sadly, I don't have enough to order a pizza.  I'm also hungry.  I won't die if I don't eat, but it sure would be nice.  So far today I've eaten the last bowl of cereal and a bag of Ritz crackers.    Thanks!
0	I haven't eaten meat in days and I no longer feel manly. 
1	In the middle of my final year university exams, got one left next Tuesday... I have no money to eat tonight and just have a pack of supernoodles, you'd be making my week! A pizza would make life seem slightly more bearable and get me to the weekend.   I'd be eternally grateful and you can live with the knowledge you helped a man get his degree. :) 
0	Straight up budgeted poorly and now I'm starving.  I'm in NYC, and would love a pick me up pizza pie from a fellow Redditor.   Help me out with some of the delicious kind of dough.
1	we are 7 people in this house, nobody's got paid yet and our fridge is empty   my friends are trying to make bread so we don't die of starvation  http://i.imgur.com/ZrSSbVZ.jpg  we are not picky, just hungry, any kind of pizza will be appreciated  - edit: [Thanks](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/1diywp/thanks_from_the_guys_in_austin_to_sgeng_and/) to Sgeng we gettin pizza right now, eternal love to you :)
1	Hello, I've never posted on here before so please excuse me if I'm doing this wrong.   I found out today the company I work for hasn't been making any money for awhile now and will have to close soon, meaning I will soon be out of a job. I'm so tired after sending out resumes all night long that I don't even want to think about making dinner. A pizza would be much appreciated.   Hope you all are having a better day then mine! Thanks 
0	We're just some pretty hungry straight edge friends looking for some grub. Eating frozen burritos gets old quick.   Thanks!   A horse walks into a bar. The bartender says, "Why the long penis?"
0	I just got dropped off from work and don't have a ride to the store until this weekend. I have some money left on my food card but the store is more than 5 miles away and I don't have anyone to look after the kids this late in the day. If someone could help me and the kids out it would mean the world to me and help get is to the weekend.
0	Hey guys, after a long week at work I could really use a pizza. I had to get my car fixed this week and it ate up all my monies except for enough to get to work for the next week. I know there probably isn't many Australians on here but it's worth a try. Worst thing about being broke? Missing Nirvana Live at the Paramount at the cinema for its only screening to mark the 20th anniversary of Nevermind.
0	Laid off earlier in the month... my bank account is in the red (-$0.39!). We're hungry and tired of canned vegetables and Chicken Helper. Can't even remember the last time we had pizza! We live a ways out from town... We don't have enough gas to pick any pizza up, and the only place where I live that delivers where I am is Papa John's. Thanks for your consideration!
0	Here's a list of current edible food (edible, keyword people):  1. 4 Eggo waffles (syrup is Dated July 2009, we're good like that). 2. 1/4 box generic Cinnamon Toast Crunch - no milk. 3. 1/3 bag Stale Cheetos. 4. Hot cocoa powder (no marshmallows included, what are we, animals?) 5. 1 slice of American cheese, no bread or crackers. 6. 1/10 Bear of Honey (went well with the waffles last 2 days tbqh). 7. 10-15 otter pops (piÃ±a colada flavor, useless).  If anyone would be willing to help out a couple of dudes in need, I'd definitely pay it forward as soon as I can (most likely a couple weeks). Keep in mind, that is a literal stock check of edible food. There is no hidden Ramen or sandwich materials, and the last of our funds went towards keeping the cats fed.  Location: Gilbert, Arizona
0	Hey guys. This is the first time Ive ever posted here. This is my throwaway though and not my actual reddit account.  Anyway I was wondering if someone could hook me up with a pizza? Im 21 years old and on government assistance (I live on my own and go to school). Ive been having a kind of shitty week. It would be pretty cool to have something to eat, as it'll be a couple days before I'll have money.  Thanks.
0	There is a Papa Johns right near us and I have a 50% off code if you'd like to use it. I looked and the total for the Pizza we would like would end up being $11.66 with the coupon.  More Info:  I started a new job on Friday and we get paid every other week, starting next week (so I'll only get paid for one day on my first paycheck on 9/7).  We have about $1080 in our checking account and rent ($1050) comes out within the next couple of days.  Husband won't get paid again until 9/14.    As for proof, I can take a screenshot of our bank account balance and a couple of past rent deductions from the account so you can see the amount and them coming out the first of the month.  I can also show where he got paid on Friday.
1	So The next quarter of school starts monday, and I get my next financial aid check on tuesday. My bank account however is at 1.83. Im not starving, but whats left in my house till tuesday is PB&amp;J, top ramen, bagged salad and brown rice. A pizza would really break up the monotony of what ive been eating since about sunday. If this request is answered, however much a person would gift me I will pay forward with interest to someone when my check goes in next week. Thank you for your time.
0	Hello, reddit! Long-time lurker, first time poster on reddit!  So at the ripe age of 22, I have finally moved out of my mom's house, and into an apartment with a friend of mine. Rent's been paid, bills are paid, hell, I even just got a job! Unfortunately, all our money has been spent on the aforementioned things, and we're down to rice and ramen in the cupboards until my first paycheck. (She's still trying to find a job). So I came here to petition for a pizza in celebration of our new apartment, new jobs, and hopefully a fresh start!   In return for a pizza, I would be returning a pizza on the day of my first paycheck (The 27th) to whoever is so kind as to get us one tonight. Hell, I'll give one away either way. I am also not above taking funny pictures with the pizza, attempting some sort of art involving the pizza, or pretty much anything else silly that one might request in return for some of that delicious, cheesy-goodness!   Thanks for considering me, and I hope you all have a grand evening!
0	My wife doesn't know I'm doing this, but she will be home from work in an hour or so and I thought it would be nice to surprise her with pizza! A series of unfortunate circumstances (notice of losing my job, lost keys to our apartment that necessitated the services of a locksmith, and a fussy cat) happened this past week that unfortunately led to us draining our bank account.  I feel bad posting this as I'm sure there are countless others who probably need it more than we do, but I figured I would ask anyway. I hope to be on the giving end next week!
0	Alas, greater education has taken many things from me, and one of those things is the ability to order pizza whenever. I won't have any money to buy pizza for a few weeks, since it's all going to tuition. Any kind souls willing to help me out?
0	I'm a college student who can barely afford to keep my apartment right now. All my money has gone to rent, utilities, and gas to get to and from school. I don't have any food right now so I would greatly appreciate it. 
0	Hello!  I'm in St-Ferreol-Les-Neiges, Quebec. I just feel like eating pizza. Unfortunately, I'm broke since I'm moving out soon. Also, I'm an unfortunate looking lesbian.   ;-)
0	I saw a pizza cut into a Triforce over on r/gaming and I thought it was really awesome. That got me hungry for pizza so I looked all over for my Topper's Pizza stickers so I could get a free pizza because i am frugal but I only had 8 of 10 stickers. So if a person would be kind enough to buy me a random pizza, I would be very glad and then you would be my reddit friend.  Optional: getting the pizza cut into a Triforce.  Also, I am an Ent and I love all you Ents out there. [4]
0	I got called in on my first weekend off in forever because my coworker is an idiot, and claims I was supposed to be in today. It's fine because I need the money anyway... but I'd really like a pizza when I get home, so I don't need to worry about cooking so late, or getting to bed at a decent hour for classes tomorrow. Plus I just would like some pizza...and I promise to share some with my dog. 
0	Rich, young, handsome male and owner of several Domino's pizza chains in great need of a free pizza.
0	So here's my story, I just applied to transfer for other schools because I can't afford my current one so I just dropped 270+ dollars on applications, I am also currently taking an EMT course that up until now I thought was completely paid for and just found out I have to pay for the simulation test, on top of the National Registry test and also get my Ambulatory License before I can even apply for a job. This all adds up to another 300+ dollars and I just had to pay rent which was another 450+ dollars. I have no food in my apartment except for 6 bags of popcorn and a gallon of water, and I have 20 dollars left in the banks. I don't have an official job but work in landscaping making money on the side whenever they have room for one more worker. My parents help but they can't help much and I don't want to worry them with this. A pizza would help me a lot, that would at least secure me for 3 more days just to keep the hunger away, especially during my finals week where concentration is a necessity. So please help, I have requested before when someone posts an offer but right now I am really really desperate so please help.   I'm in California, specifically San Diego.
0	The title says is all. If anyone can spare me a pizza it will make me less depressed about what I have to do to get my Star Wars fix.  In London, On.
0	Hi I'm Ian.  I live with my mom and three siblings in LA. My parents recently got in a divorce and between all the legal fees, there's not a steady flow of money coming in. It would mean the world to me if I could help my mom out and surprise her with a pizza/dinner. I know she'd be happy. If anyone could help we would really appreciate it. 
0	So..  without giving you my whole life story here goes -   I have been having health issues that have been progressively worse over the last few years.  (I am getting tested for carcinoma this week)  My girlfriend not only has stayed with me but provides me with everything I need, including expensive pre-existing condition insurance which she had to move across the country for me to have.  I keep trying to work from home and sell my stuff on ebay etc. but I never will equal the amount that she gives without any hesitation.  I have not been able to take this girl out for dinner in 3 years and she works full time.  It would make my lifetime to be able to surprise her with pizza that was acquired by me.  *as a caveat my illness causes me to not be able to eat, consequently I am not excited about food much less cooking it and not eating it so this would save me from that too for a night :)   http://instagram.com/p/UDEVvJGFY9/   edit:  Heres our rescue Ruby.  I'll show you gretchen (mah kitty) of anyone cares
0	Hi!  Hopefully someone can help me out, I'm starving and exhausted. Been applying for jobs consistently, luckily I have a job interview tomorrow - but I'm broke. A pizza tonight would make my weekend and my day tomorrow!  Oh, and lovely subreddit as well. :) You're all spectacular folks.
0	I just got home from working a 15 hour shift, now I'm wishing I had some pizza. I recently got 2 flat tires, so getting that fixed so I can go to work on top of all my other bills has left me with $2 U.S. Thanks!!!
0	All alone in a seven bed after a long day at my work experience placement. Working for no money! So please make my day. :)
0	I am a college student getting ready to graduate in a few months. I started working with my colleague a year ago in weddings to make money on the side.   Long story short things have not been working out for us very well. We haven't signed off any new clients, bills are starting to rack, and a pizza would go a long way for us. 
0	I live in Ohio
1	I've been eating ramen for a few days now. My mother offered to give me food, but I can't afford the gas to drive out to her house until I get my next paycheck, on friday. If anyone wants to help me get a pizza, I can either repay the favor on friday or pay it forward.
0	Long story short: I lost my wallet a week ago, which had my debit card/ID/etc. So even though I have enough in my account to get a value meal from mcdonalds, I'm shit out of luck. Plus, pizza is way way better. :D. Thanks for your time and consideration.
0	My friend, also a redditor, and I have been homeless for the last few weeks together. We have been having to shoplift what food we can and we've begged change. We have a steady location for the next 24 hours or so.  Anyone out there that can help us out? It would be greatly appreciated. We've been surviving on next to nothing for the past week.  Thanks. 
0	hi im andrew, jobs have been hard to come by and im in school so im busy. if someone could buy me a pizza, id likely return the favor once i have the cash...guranteed i will :D im hungry so please help. thank you very much
0	I love pizza
0	I feel bad for asking, but this is probably the hardest point of my life so far. I just graduated high school, and i got kicked out right away. I've been living with my boyfriend but hes just as broke as i am. If anyone could help me out right now, i'd be highly grateful and will return the offer when possible. :)  btw, sorry for the sketchy account. I'm a lurker (never really felt the need to comment on stuff. =/)
0	Hey! I'm a recent college grad in Seattle and I've been having a tough time trying to live on my own what with trying to find a job, pay rent and pay off loans simultaneously. I've really been craving pizza this week and it would be amazing to not have to eat ramen, rice or beans for a change. I can provide any verification needed and I hope to be on my feet soon to pay it forward.
0	Hey Reddit. I feel horrible for this, but here I am, asking for pizza. I've just moved from Alabama to Austin, Texas, in an attempt to change my life's direction and take charge of my student debt etc. To that end, I've gotten a job in Austin and am currently living on the floor in my own apartment (can't afford a bed). My check is coming on Friday, for three weeks' work at a big box retailer, but I haven't been able to afford food for four days, all my my remaining income going towards gas to get to/from work. Anyway, I would very much appreciate some kind of assistance, though I know you are in no way obligated to do so.   It'd totally make my week though. &lt;3
0	So I'm completely broke at this point, just a bag of rice left until the end of the month. Pizza is a huge treat, but realistically- does anyone know of a food bank (or similar place) in Montreal?  Thanks :)
0	Just moved to Pittsburgh and have been eating baked beans all week. Would absolutely love to get some 'za in my system. Any love would be greatly appreciated!
1	I'm not usually one to ask for charity but, I have a negative amount of dollars in my bank account until I get paid next week and I haven't eaten in two days.
0	My car is non-op atm, and I'm completely starving. I would order in but, my credit card is dead empty. I have small fortune sitting in Paypal, but it is currently un-usable to me to get food and sustenance.  [I am a freelance graphic designer with over 6 years of experience](http://ethereal-design.net/), so, if you need anything done in trade, hit me up, I really need some dinner, and possibly a soda. Alternatively, if you would just prefer I pay you in paypal, that is quite alright as well :) Help feed a starving artist! 
0	I'm an educator who is also a student.  I'm usually the one to help others out when they are in need.  But now I find myself who is the one in need.  After paying the mortgage, and the Phone bill and the light bill I found myself not able to pay for or buy any food for myself.  That was all most two weeks ago.  A friend of mine told me about this website so hear I am.  I hope that some one see's this post and is kind enough to help some one like me out with a pizza.   I'm in Conyers, GA       
0	Just been diagnosed with cancer for the second time at age 20. This is my last weekend of freedom before I have to go into hospital and lose all my hair and shit myself inside out for a week so I'd really appreciate a pizza. Before sending pizza I can provide proof (Even if you look over my profile from Oct 2011 to feb 2012 when I first got chemo) It's very easy to get pizza delivered online in Ireland btw. Thank you
0	Hey everyone! The title pretty much says it all....I'm totally craving a pizza and can't afford one right now :( If some generous, pizza loving Redditor would like to get me one to last until my payday, which is Saturday, I would really appreciate it.  I will pay it forward when I have the means. Thanks!
0	My roommates, some who are graduating, and I are trying to celebrate this last week but are broke like normal college students.  Save us the beer money and please send us a pizza here at the University of Illinois. It will be much appreciated.
1	I see constant whining and sob stories to get a pizza. I don't have one. I can say that I'm asking for some pizza because it sounds good, I haven't had it in a while and would really enjoy it. Thanks for the consideration. Have a great day.
0	I'm sitting at home contemplating eating a tunafish and ketchup sandwich because that's all I have left in my pantry.  I work at a restaurant where I make 9.75 an hour but I'm currently barely paying for my rent (which includes my gas and water bills). I just paid rent on the 7th after having scrapped together the tips I make off the grill I work to pay for rent.  I've got a total of 2.71 in my bank account and I don't get paid until next Tuesday.  I've got the next 2 days off and while I will be able to buy some food Saturday with my grill tips I only usually make about $15 bucks after a 6 hour shift.    If anyone would be kind of enough to fulfill my offer I will be back next Tuesday to return the favor to some lucky human or humans. If I don't return the favor by Tuesday.  I will post a picture of my shame to /r/pics explaining my unconscionable behavior.
0	Hey everybody. I've been out of real work for a while, and all my part time construction money is going towards bills. I would really like to eat something other than top ramen while I look for a job. I will be eternally grateful and pay it forward the day I can. There will be so much pizza being given out you guys won't even know what to do. Thanks for reading.
0	We are two 21 year old sisters on our own on the islands of Honolulu and we just spent what little money we could muster together to make this months rent. Things have been tight with money and we don't have anything to cook except for noodles. Not even butter :( Food has not entered our lives since yesterday morning, and it's now 8:00 pm. We would just really like a veggie pizza to enjoy with some Sprite maybe while we sit back and watch a movie. God bless
0	located in kansas city, missouri.  my roommate used all my cash for gas and i haven't eaten in two days.  i'd appreciate some food.  promise to pay it forward.
0	I have ramen, and a couple old soups. I'm not really in dire circumstances, just trying to get myself out of credit debt from years ago. (this was to take care of my late mother though). I also got hit with that magic "planets align to form one super big billing cycle with all my bills" time. I don't really expect any pizza, but if someone is rich and bored, i'm merely an outlet. My only offer to you is that i promise, on the soul of my dearest mother, to pay it forward in the coming weeks. Bothell, wa (just north of seattle)
0	As the titles says I took my last final of the summer semester this morning and would love a pie to celebrate and to enjoy while packing up my apartment to move tomorrow!
0	Hey everyone.  My mom is a registered NICU nurse. She works graveyards, 12 hours a shift, 3 nights a week. She worked last night and is working tonight as well. She works incredibly hard for our family.  While she's been asleep today, I've been working on cleaning the house. I'll admit, I'm a bit slacking on this subject and it's usually done by mom.   I figured, what would be better than waking up to a clean house? How about waking up to a clean house AND dinner?  Unfortunately, I don't have any money. I've been unemployed for 2 months now and must put all of what I have left into my credit card bills. It's kind of uncomfortable asking others to feed you and your family, but I figured it wouldn't hurt. I promise everyone here that I plan on buying some pies for others, regardless of anyone helping today or not.  I appreciate you taking the time to read this. Lets make my moms day!  P.s. we live around Sacramento, CA.
0	Hey guys, I have never done this before so be nice to me! ;P  I'm in Pharmacy school in North Dakota (CST) and have three tests this week. I worked last week and weekend and again tomorrow and I am just tired. I have been surviving off of coffee ;P  It is getting about hungry time and I just feel too lazy to get up and make something vs. just order something. (I should be studying all of your renal transporters. ;X)The only downside of course is spending way more money ordering a pizza!  So, if anyone is interested, that would be awesome!
1	Us + our two children. A family member who is usually here is in the hospital and the last few days have been hard for everyone. There is really no food to speak of and we won't be able to get anything until the 24th.   Full disclaimer, someone did get us a couple of pizzas 17 days ago. I feel like I should be honest about this being another request after a somewhat recent one from us. But we are stuck in such a bad situation this month, we called food banks to see if any of them could drop off some food for us (but none will deliver, even if you have no transportation, which we don't) and with $1.51 to our name right now, this is all I could think of.   Thank you for reading and considering our request. We very much hope to be on the giving end of things someday.
0	Not going to lie, I honestly want to see if RAOP is what everyone says it is. Also Pizza is delicious.      PS I live in New Brunswick, Canada.
1	Last few days alone in my student house before i'm homeless. Would really appreciate a solid meal to cheer me up and give me the energy to carry on looking for jobs/somewhere to live. I'm sure there are people more worthy than I, but i feel i've exhausted everything else bar soup kitchens. I'm pretty new to all this,, but i'm sure i'll be back on my feet soon and will be happy to repay the favour to another worthy redditor.  
0	As the title says, my GF is leaving me. We've been together for years. I'm pretty torn up. I quit my job and left all my friends behind to move to this city with her after she got a job offer here, and it's been a nightmare since I got here.  I came down here and interviewed, was drug tested, and filled out paperwork for a job before I ever moved here. However once I got here they told me they couldn't hire me because of a hiring freeze. I've been unemployed for 2 months and it is terrible - I've not had a gap in employment for 5 years. My girlfriend thinks I am a loser despite my taking care of our 3 cats and dog, doing all the household chores, and applying for many jobs and going to interviews. I supported her when she was unemployed in the past, but she does not care.  In addition my car is going to be fixed Friday, which I desperately need so I can continue looking for work after my girlfriend leaves me. I owe the mechanic $800 and I have to drive 4 hours to pick it up.  I can't let this stuff get me down, I need to keep my head up and find a job here so I'll be able to support myself.  With gas and everything I am completely broke. This is my first time on this sub - if someone would be so kind as to gift me a pizza it would totally brighten up my life. I will pass it forward when I become employed. Thanks so much!
0	This is a final option for me as far as getting food goes.  Any help is appreciated.  Please &amp; thank you in advance.
0	Me and my friend are house/pet sitting and the owners left no food. We don't get paid for a few more days and a nice hot pizza would mean the world to us. We will definitely do an offer once we get paid. Please pm me! Thank you!!
0	Our two dogs and I've been cleaning our house to keep it nice for her. I've had no time to myself and we ran out of food yesterday. Would seriously love a pizza tonight 
0	We've spent the last three days playing n64 and watching movies because all of our friends left and it's freezing outside.
0	I just got my wisdom teeth taken out, and thanks to the drugs, bleeding, and swollen cheeks, I pretty much can't do anything except stay inside or sleep. I can't even watch TV or be on the computer that much, because my head hurts if I stare at the screen too much. I'm constantly bombarded with pictures of good food (unhealthy food) on Facebook, Twitter, and of course Reddit, and I would love to have a pizza to celebrate my healing process (whenever that might be). I don't have a sob story to tell, but I'm low on cash and have to pay my credit card off soon anyways. Any sort of pizza flavored goodness would be appreciated.   If you want, I could write you a poem, send you a photo of something (within reason, I'm not talking gonewild material here), record some guitar playing, or something like that. Just let me know, I'm not doing much with my time anyways.
0	So I've got 5 exams over the next two weeks and a HUGE job interview next Monday that'll determine my financial state for the summer, and I'm hungry.  If I get the pizza and the job my first paycheck is gonna go towards paying it forward.
0	My 3 boys wear me out every night! I could use a pizza tonight for after when they go to bed!
0	[relevant source as to why I would ask total strangers for pizza](http://i.imgur.com/nhCti.png)  I'm a little down on my luck for a few days and if anyone can spare the charity of a sausage/pepperoni pizza, it'd be well appreciated. Thank you for your time and happy holidays.   I live in North Georgia, near Berry College.   I posted in the other thread, but found that this one looks more legit. 
0	Hey guys my name is Dwight I live in Kula, Hawaii and would like to have some pizza tonight or sometime this week. Last Friday I found out my dad's house which I live at is being foreclosed on. I didn't even know that that was going to happen. I'm pretty broke and I would really like a pizza if you guys are ok with giving me one. Ask me anything and thanks you guys are awesome! Edit: Just got a gift card from Paulinator. Thank you all so Much!
0	Three years ago today i tried a meatlovers pizza, this may come across as weird but seeing as how i am a jew it makes sense, and the joy it brought to me was incredible. So incredible that i in fact that being a 19yr old jew saw no reason to continue in that religion bc i was held back from pizza that long and for what reason?? cause the greatest food on earth, BACON, was considered "unclean"??? Negative ghostrider the pattern is fulll. i need another pizza, soon or else bad things will happen to my friends. their life is in ur hands. Help a little old jewish guy and his broke friends out...get a NIGGA his pizza.   
0	I've been having a stressed out anxiety ridden week. I've had issues with my eating but not bad enough to be considered anorexic. So I've been eating sporadically. Sleeping not so well either.   I tend to use weed to help me actually want to eat. Well it's not really been working. Been smoking since yesterday and haven't gotten the desire to eat.   That is until I started thinking about pizza. I think I was even just reading the word pizza. I instantly started fantasizing about pizza. Then hit my brick wall when I remembered I have no money due to 4/20.  I know I need to eat, but I just can't see me putting in the effort to make something I'll actually eat.   
0	You're probably going to check out my previous posts. Go ahead. :)  
0	I'm a Single Mother that was forced to move out of my cousin's basement due to flooding caused by hurricane Irene. My children &amp; I have just moved into an apartment, but money is a little tight. It would be amazing to get some pizza!
0	I don't really know the right format. sorry. I don't have starving kids or cats, but I would enjoy a pizza.  NC,USA.  Thanks in advance.       PS: trust me, my cats are not starving.  actually they are getting a little chunky.
0	Thanks in advance if anyone wants to help, I'll pay it forward when I can.
0	Our family has been stuck eating sandwiches, cups of soup and cereal for the past three weeks since our car blew up and left us stranded in a hotel room. I would love to make my kids smile by having pizza delivered to them for dinner tonight. Can anyone help us?? We would greatly apprecaite it!! 
0	-A weird power struggle at my fathers work ousted him of his position and severance pay.  -We both spent most of our remaining funds on a car we can share because he will no longer have a company car to drive.  -Pizza sounds great right now but we're both too broke for one.   -Any words/thoughts/pizzas greatly appreciated
0	Due to problems with work not paying me correctly or on time, I've fallen in a situation where all of my funds had to go towards my rent. I get a paycheque tomorrow but have zero funds until then, and not gonna lie I'm a little hungry! Heard about this subreddit and thought I'd give asking for internet help a try, and would love to return the favour this week as well! 
0	Would love a delicious pizza instead of having to cook for Monday Night Football!  It's either pizza or beans and rice, which isn't as celebratory for what's sure to be a great game.  My husband would be way happier with pizza.
0	Hi I am in need of food for my 4 children we are a military family that has really hit hard times and we have exahusted all means of help just to be able to feed my family and make it through another night is all i ask i know our blessing is coming so whatever u can find in your heart to give is greatly appreciated
0	parents have 3 small dogs and wont let me move back home from college with my pitbull :( sad times.  
0	I haven't been able to afford much in a while and it would be awesome if someone could help a brother out! The person who buys will get a drawing and a song, both of their choice sent to them via the interwebs.
0	Well,   I have been broke for the past month or so and have been sustaining myself on a diet of Chef Boyardee and Hot Pockets. I do still have a can of Chef Boyardee left, but it's stomach churning just to look at. I'd just really like a hot (not microwaved) meal.   The good news is that I will be getting some money tomorrow, and will be happy to, at the discretion of the pizza donor:   1) Pay it forward with another pizza gift on this here subreddit OR;  2) Send my donor a fully functioning, used, Xbox 360 hard drive (20gb).   Verification provided upon request. Thanks!
1	I would absolutely love some delicious pizza. That warm baked crust; the gooey cheese; the sauce that compliments both crust and cheese alike. Maybe some succulent ham or some savory pepperoni? Mouthwatering. Would anyone care to hook a brother up?
1	I'm currently dogsitting for a close friend. They were supposed to be home an hour ago, but I just got called and they have apologised and said they won't be back for about another 12 hours. They did say I could help myself to what was in the fridge, so I had a look and, and [this](http://imgur.com/vKTKU) was the sum total - 1 tub of butter, 1 tub of margerine, a tray of expired eggs, some wine, some flat pepsi, some stale milk and a bottle of lemonade. I'm so hungry right now it's unreal, and I will happily pay this forward when I get back home tonight.
0	I've had the occasional gout attack but the ones this week have taken the cake. Have been bedridden and crawling around literally and had an attack in my other foot last night so unable to get around at all. If anyone suffers from guilt you know how hellish and depressing it is. Anyways just posting to see if any kind sympathetic soul would send a pizza over (easy on the meat ; )) since I can even get up and cook. I guess I could crawl to the door. Thanks.
0	Hello RoaP! I just want to go into a small amount of detail in this post and tell you guys how much we're in love. I will keep this post as appropriate as possible for the amount of detail I'll be going in to.   I was with my girlfriend on her 18th birthday and she really wanted to go down to the arcade. We're a new couple, so of course I'm trying to look cool in front of her so I say something along the lines of "Alright, if you really want to," when really I wanted to shout at the top of my excitement "ARE YOU SURE IT'S YOU'RE BIRTHDAY AND NOT MINE BECAUSE I LOVE THE ARCADE, WOOOOO--"   So we're at the arcade playing these goofy silly games, like the game where you put a quarter in and you watch your quarter go down into a pile of quarters and there is a metal bar that just might push more quarters down into the prize pit and ANYWAY, we're having fun.   So she eventually has to go to the little girl's room and she forgets to bring her phone. I took her phone and started counting up our tickets when all of a sudden her phone gets a text and a picture of her best friend's face pops up on the screen. I don't like to go through other peoples texts, but I see the word "Tony" before I put the phone back in my pocket, which is my first name. So I read just the 1 text. It states: "Tony better remember what you asked for last week." My stomach got this twisted feeling of "oh crap how could I forget."    !!!!!    JUST THEN --- A pizza delivery guy from the pizza place right next door is walking out to his car about to leave, so I rush him and scream "hey wait!". I ask him what kind of pizza, how much was it, and paid him in full plus a 10$ tip. I asked him to hold the pizza for a minute, and ran across the street to the joke shop and bought a gag sausage (don't ask me why there was one there, I wasn't paying attention at the time.)   I took the gag sausage back to the pizza, took out my pocket knife, and cut up a slice small enough to look similar to a pepperoni. Next, I took a pen and paper and wrote a note and pinned it down with a candle on top and just then, she's walks out of the bathroom and I start singing happy birthday. People around the room joined in and we all clapped for her as she blew out the candle.   She has this ear to ear smile that is to die for. She gave me a fairly large 'thank you' kiss and said "I thought you forgot!".   She took the note off of the fake pepperoni and read it. "I will love you until the last pepperoni fades." she starting crying like she just won the lottery.  ---- Now, fast forwarding 5 years later, we are still happily together and enjoying our youth, but her birthday is today and I plan to have dinner with her this evening.   I would love to see someone else kind enough to pass down a pizza to a young couple in love.
0	We could really use some pizza. Live in suffolk NY  Thank you.
0	Fellow ents,  I am currently in a pickle.  I went out last night and forgot to close my tab before I left the bar.  Currently, however, I am too high to go and get it from the bar.  Simultaneous, my state has made me very hungry and would love to order people.  Alas, I can't because I don't have my card.  If any of you can find it in your heart to help me out, I promise to pay it forward when the time comes.
0	I live on a very tight budget and the ends just didn't meet this month.  A pizza and the bit of ramen and rice I have left will hold me over until the end of the month.  I am currently in training at a local waffle house.  I will be cooking eventually, but I'm training on tables for now.  Unfortunately, male waiters don't make tips for squat around this area.  My last $20 (mostly quarters) is to be used to drive from Jackson, to Vicksburg, and back so I can visit my dad for Thanksgiving.
0	Hey, I'm from Brampton, Ontario, Canada. I created this account to post here, as I was refferred by a fellow redditor. Would someone be willing to send me a gift card to Pizza Pizza? Any amount of money is good, but prefferably 20$. If my request is filled I will surely return the favour in the future!
0	Food stamps are now 2 weeks late due to moving counties and a new case worker that is slow as molasses in January. She's had my completed file for 2 full weeks (as of Friday) and still hasn't "processed" it. (Whatever that entails..)   My family (Me, Hubby, and 2yr old baby girl) have been living off our pantry and freezer for 2+ weeks. Last night we used our last chicken breast. Today was literally buttered rice.  The food stamp office is closed till Monday morning at which point I will be calling my case worker, her supervisor, as well as her supervisor's supervisor; hourly, if necessary, until I have money to buy food for my family.  Until then anyone wanna send us a pizza?  edit: p.s. no papa johns in my city... thank you Sniperman for the offer though! Hope someone else gets to enjoy that pizza! 
0	I'd love a pizza and I'm in Austin, Texas! Just finished my first year at UT, big accomplishment! Craving pizza and a break from packing.... Help a sista out?
0	Basically I ran out of money in my school checking account and my personal checking account my debit card has expired so as of Tuesday im waiting 10-14 business days for a new one. Only have like 3 cans of tuna, couple packs of ramen and like a decent amount of pb&amp;j but like 2 slices of bread left and some kraft singles. Should be enough to keep me fed until I can access my funds but a pizza this weekend would really let ration what I have left in case I have to wait a full 14 days. Tallahassee Florida, FSU student. Parents will not help (as usual) they said if I need money ill have to wait 3 weeks. You don't understand how much I would appreciate this.
0	Thank you in advance to the kind soul who might hopefully buy us a pizza. 
1	I'm in Brainerd, MN. Anything is incredibly appreciated. Thanks, Reddit. 
1	I dont get paid until tomorrow, and we have nothing to eat for dinner. my 5 and 7 year old really love pizza and it would be a great surprise for them to have pizza for dinner. So a Ecard would really be helpful cause i can order around dinner time and surprise my babies with pizza.
1	My job switched pay cycles and this month I got only one paycheck, which had to go to rent and bills. I literally have no money right now and I went through the last of my food yesterday (which was the last of my popcorn). I get paid Friday, so I plan to pay it forward. Thanks!
0	My husband was laid off 2 months ago, the money finally ran out, even after eating one meal a day. We have a beautiful son born on July 30, WIC covers his formula but mommy and daddy can't eat until daddy gets a new job, and no one is calling either of us back for interviews. Got a letter today that SSI has reduced my payments to 0.00, even though we're broke, and now we can't make rent tomorrow. We could really use a good last meal in our home, I know this is my first post, but I saw this site on the news a while back and never felt like i deserved it as much as some of these other people, but then again I never thought we'd end up at the point we are now. I can provide more details if you don't believe me, but I would be eternal grateful to whoever would be willing to grant us this wish. Bless you. 
0	Long time occasional lurker, first time poster here. I am 21, a recent college graduate, who managed to land a game programming job prior to graduating (and by luck my job actually pays well), however this month when trying to get ahead in tuition loan payments and spending a bit to try to get into basic electronics engineering as a hobby I managed to somehow end up in quite the situation. Due to a compounding of unexpected expenses, netflix pulling money out of the wrong (and empty) account, a rather large (at least for me) loan payment, and well simply an outright failure to budget this month... I managed to become absolutely broke aside from the bare minimum I need to get to work once this week (I work from home mostly as well).   For the past week I've been limited to the scarce quanitity of frozen meals that I bought about two weeks prior, however three weeks ago for what ever reason I acquired a large amount of soda. I ran out of food two days ago and my only intake since then has been soda. At first I was like, "No big deal, I get paid in a few days", but that has turned into "MAYBE IF I USE THESE NAIL CLIPPERS I CAN CARVE A HOLE IN THIS 360 CONTROLLER TO LIVE IN THIS SODA CAN COLLECTION" mental instability.  Long story short, I have no karma, no food, but get paid in about 3-6 days (my job is slowly moving to direct deposit but hasn't set me up yet...) and I would really like a pizza. In exchange, I'd be more than willing to pay you back as soon as I get paid, or do some small task of some reasonable sort.  I prefer Dominos, a medium pizza and a "build your own breadbowl pasta" (usually a coupon deal online) can last me almost two days, but really I'll take whatever I can get as I'm not exactly in a position to choose.  Heres a link to my outdated blog for some loose type of verification? (I also have one of those verification system code things as well). http://www.forecourse.com  Also, what I've been 'eating' the last two-three days: http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash4/392812_1674416038329_1775307151_885951_630529237_n.jpg
1	Throwing myself at your feet, oh charitable redditors.   There is nothing special about my circumstances.  I am tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt, 3 months out of school with not even fast food franchises hiring me.  My food outlook tonight is bleak, and instead of mooching my roommate's little bit of groceries for the umpteenth time, I'd like to instead surprise her with pizza.   The day I get an actual paycheck I will pay it forward  Proof I'm not a robot: http://imgur.com/j6SP9  PM for verification code &amp; details
0	So I moved back home to Southeastern WI at the start of March when I could not find a new job. As soon as I got home a friend resigned and recommended me for his position. I'm just waiting for them to decide what to do with the position.  In the mean time I sure could go for some cheese. Especially tonight. Want a sob story? How about this. I bought myself a $6.00 block of cheese last week. Made two sandwiches from it and then my dad ate the rest. In one sitting. 
1	Help a girl out? 1 medium cheese pizza to my work... Thank you and lots of love to whoever has a heart big enough to fulfill these requests.  
0	Don't really have money for food right now. I haven't eaten yet today. That's about it.
0	I've been laid off since June and while my wife makes enough to keep us (us and two boys) afloat; we've had to cut way back and we've been living without any extras. Great news is she just got a raise, which she'll get on her next pay check. RAoP'ers, would anyone care to help us into this home stretch with one crazy night of cheesy goodness? Thanks for listening.
0	Pretty much the title. The family in my household are much older, and also hoarders, and recently my kitchen has become very disgusting due to a fuit fly infestation. Aside from physiologically messing me up, it kind of also makes eating or preparing anything in the kitchen unbearable with a hundred little disgusting flys buzzing around. They have always been hoarders, but the past couple years the living standard has gone down pretty bad in this place..   I plan to spend tomorrow really getting in there and doing some damage(cleaning wise), they even managed to get into and breed in the microwave.   Needless to say, I have been eating out a lot more than usual(McDonalds dollar menu is a godsend) and it's killing my bank, which approximately now has 1 dollar and something cents, or else i'd order myself pizza.  So I  have my verification code and would be tremendously grateful for this act not to mention making sure to return the favor when I have more cash at hand(poor college student, ofcourse) to another unlucky individual.   Thanks for your time.
0	I don't need a pizza, but in keeping with the name of the subreddit a random act of pizza would really hit the spot. Thanks!
1	The last few weeks have sucked and I could use a pick me up. A pizza would actually make my day.
1	So, I didn't find out my wife was leaving me today, I found that out a couple weeks ago, but, I did find out it was for another guy today. Worst day of my life, and I need something to eat, but I don't feel motivated to do anything, not even cook. I would be appreciative of whomever would like to help me out, and I'll pass it on when I get paid on Thursday.
0	If any of you have interned on the hill or in DC you understand how expensive everything is here...  you'll understand my plea. I've been limiting myself to one meal under $10 a day for the past month and just stumbled on this sub. I'm a long time reddit user and hate asking for help, but shit am I hungry.  My stomach is screaming at me just thinking about pizza right now. 
1	It's my niece's birthday and she is turning 8. Normally my folks (her grandparents) would get some dinner and a cake, but they're both out of town so it's just me, her mother and her. Her mom hasn't gotten a paycheck yet and my bank account is currently low as well... I thought about making some cupcakes instead as a substitute b-day cake. But my niece would really like some pizza for dinner, it's her fav. :)  I'll pass it forward as soon as I'm able to, so any takers?
0	Any fellow hockey fans out there?
0	Apparently there has been a huge delay on food stamps in the state of NC due to some software changes. And we have been delayed for about a month. We just got hit with it.  Large Family 2 adults 4 teens 3 little ones. We are in the process of contacting local churches and food pantries etc. Let me know. Papa Johns is the only things that delivers to our house (out in the boonies).
0	Will be returning home tomorrow to Warren, Rhode Island after a long train ride home from Florida for my brother's wedding - will be getting in around 6pm, left today at 7pm - 23 hour trip with layovers! A pizza would be immensely appreciated.
0	All I have is canned soup and ichiban noodles in the house. about 1 foot of snow fell on Southern Alberta over night, drifting to 3 feet, and I have yet to dig out my car or clear the driveway to go get groceries.
0	I've been dizzy and having migraines since yesterday. I'd love pizza so my dad has something to eat when he gets home.
0	Family is losing their house due to foreclosure, was living with them and then they kicked me out because they had "too much to worry about without worrying about you." Staying with friend in the meantime, but there is no food anywhere in sight. Hungry and could really use a pizza to cry into/over indulge with. 
1	I'll send a photo of my driver's license with a "hey &lt;username&gt;" next to it. Just thought a pizza could help with a forever aloneness! Thanks so much to the person who can help me, or just to give me someone to talk to as I take one step closer to death o.0 I live in Virginia - edit  Edit: Thanks for the birthday wishes you guys! Even if i dont get a pizza I really appreciate the support. 
0	I am single mother i have no food in the house and do not get paid for another day or so. It would be amazing if someone kind soul would feed me dinner tonight. Me and my daughter would love it!
0	I live in MA, I'm gluten free, and everything in my apartment that I could eat kind of sucks. I would really, really appreciate some gluten free pizza from domino's for my boyfriend and me :]. Ask me for details and whatnot, I have some other allergies as well.  Hoping to be able to regift some one of these days!
0	I am getting incredibly tired of rice-gruel for every meal (and a bit low on rice). Payday is a ways away. How can I beg/barter/steal my way into your hearts for a little slice of paradise?
1	Anyone else ever had Pizza Ranch? Delicious pies, for real. If anyone would be kind enough to help out a college student with some Pizza Ranch for dinner, it would be so appreciated. Either way, thanks!  **EDIT** I know they do online gift cards. Again, either way, thanks for reading!
0	Short on cash this summer, currently taking summer B classes at Usf I'm a out of town student low on funds and a friend told me that site helps. Not looking for much just something to hold me over through to the weekend..Thanks 
0	No real sob story here, just trying to test this out and me and my roommate are two broke ass college students looking for some pizza while we study. Thanks in advance (:
0	Hey my name is Andrew. Currently i'm unemployed and stream video games via twitch.tv full time to try and make some money here and there. I live in the Denver, Colorado area roughly.  I live at home with my mom after a few heavy life incidents led me to leave my job and move back home.  Streaming hasn't been making me much lately and i've been pretty broke, had to quit smoking cold turkey and can't exactly afford food at the moment either.  The last few days i've been really achy and sick and my mom didn't get child support for whatever  reason so we are scraping by until we get food stamps in a few days.  I've been looking for a job and working on getting my GED to help out on that front but no luck so far seeing as how I can't commute downtown every day.  If anyone would be cool and get me a pizza or something, that would be pretty legit.  Not really sure what else to put here, so sorry if anyone is looking for more info i'd be happy to edit my post for whatever reason.   Edit: I saw a contest for some bad MS paint art, i like to draw champions from League of Legends in paint for people who donate to my stream, so i'd be happy to draw one or more for someone who donates a pizza. (Doesn't have to be league related, but i'm terrible.) 
0	Dont really have a sob story... just moved into a new place, the start up fees for all my utilities and internet left me broke until my next paycheck. Hoping i could find a pizza to tide me over, planning to pay it forward when i get my paycheck this week.   also, i'll draw anything you want. poorly.  im in scranton, PA
0	Could really use a pizza while I work on assignments after work tonight. This week has been hell. My "friend" moved to Ontario with a bunch of my shit. Been working full time, but still only have 8 bucks left after paying my rent. Finals are fast approaching, as well as the deadlines for my university assignments. This and my work week isn't slowing down. Could just use the pick me up after work tonight I guess.
0	We live in petaluma California and wont be able to get our foods stamps for another couple of weeks, a fresh pizza would cheer her up, random acts of kindness always cheers her up, Thank you and God Bless
0	I don't have a sob-story, just think a pizza for me and the family would be nice until we get paid tomorrow.
1	Help my wife and I celebrate the birth of our first child with a pizza. Wren was born at 6:00 pm on 7/30/11. She weighed 7lbs 12oz and 19.5 inches long. I have used the verification system and have lots of pictures that I need to upload.
0	The things we do for our pets...
0	Alright Reddit, I'll be straight. I'm not super desperate for food. If someone else says they're on their last legs and need a pie, go take care of them first. By the time I get paid I will definitely not be starving or any such thing. But a man can only sustain on 20 cent ramen for so long before he goes crazy.  Money's Friday. You do me a solid on this, Reddit, and I'll soon reciprocate with a delicious start to your weekend.  E-gifts would be preferred (if I am allowed to say?). THANKS TTYL.
0	I've been having a couple of harsh months (lung surgery, recovering, severe nerve damage, no money, on disability, etc.). Because of the amount of pain I am dealing with I don't get around to much. Overall, my dream is to become a pulmonary/critical care specialist to help people like me. I wasn't going to go back to school this semester because of the pain (and not having any money) but I decided this week to still keep pursuing my education. So I got a loan for school and was approved, and classes start next Wednesday. I am very excited.   Edit: Also because I want to eat pizza on my living room floor while watching all of netflix. 
0	Just got out of the hospital, not anything major but I was there overnight.  My roommate left to work out of state this morning (left me an empty pantry and fridge), and the few friends I have here are busy.  Parents are 2.5 hours away and that's way too long to wait for food.  Can Reddit help me out?
1	Hello!  I have been considering making a request on here for a while so I decided today that I would actually do it!  This was motivated by paying my rent online today and seeing my bank balance shrink (eep), so having one less dinner to worry about would be really nice.    Right now everything that I am paying is coming out of my student loans since I was unable to find a summer job, and it is stressing me out.  A pizza would just make me feel better!   I will of course try to pay it forward as soon as I can, let's hope that one of these job applications works out~  Thanks for reading, RAOP!
1	I was talking to this girl for almost a month that I truly liked. Finally asked her out in a date tried yo call her the next day and she hit me with "your a great Guy but i can't date you". Please I need comfort food 
0	I am a new college student and have been having a real hard time these first few weeks with financial aid and as a result i am not on a meal plan this year.  Because of this i have to buy all of my own food which is a problem because i have very little money to begin with.  Ive been having 1 ramen cup a day and thats all i have eaten in 4-5 days.  Im really hungry and a friend recommended this subreddit.  Please Help.
1	Short version of my sob story:  We receive food stamps (husband laid off, both of us also working on our bachelors degrees) which honestly keeps us through the month pretty well.  Food stamp card broke in half and can't find a store to honor it.  We ordered a new card but it won't be here for 7-10 business days. Out of pretty much everything but can visit a food pantry day Monday to make ends meet. Right now things are bleak.   I have a hidden bag a marshmallows in  the back of the cupboard and some wood in the back yard - would love a pizza lunch/dinner and then surprise them with some flaming 'mellows.     EDIT: [Here](http://imgur.com/a/SDvrC#6jszl) are some fresh hot pizza pics. There is a ton leftover for lunch tomorrow too!  Thanks so much to IrritableOwlSyndrome for perking this place up today.  unfortunately it is too rainy for Part B with the fire pit and marshmallows, so I am about to get involved in the longest game of Monopoly in the world.   EDIT2:  This subreddit is fucking awesome and a good example of the good parts of reddit. 
1	  Just looking to add a little food to the fridge in the form of leftovers.  I deleted a request because I requested a few times over a few days, unsuccessfully.  I should have planned for this, but I didnt and now I dont know where to turn for help.  I am in the process of finding assistance from an agency of some sort. I have never been in this position before, I am trying to adjust as best I can.
0	Crushed my Engineering homework, my Calculus II midterm, and even a Chemistry assignment. Got so much done today, so I'd love to top it all off with a pizza when I get home tonight! Thanks RAoP, I'll pay it forward next paycheck :)
0	I have my grandfather visiting my family and we had premade a meal to eat tonight.  However, it was frozen and is taking forever to cook.  We decided to say screw it and maybe have pizza.  My wife doesn't believe something like this subreddit is possible, help me prove her wrong!
1	I'm currently in debt of a rather severe nature, nothing in my kitchen except some Del Taco hot sauce and tortillas, and that's what I've been surviving off of. I have a pen and pad, "will art 4 pizza."  xposted from other RAOP.
1	Title says it all. The two guys that were scheduled to work with me today both didn't show, so I'm stuck talking to customer and fixing computers alone all day long :(  Normally the owner would buy me lunch in these situations, but he just had a hip replacement, and I'm stuck running the show till he gets back.   It's no biggie, but I can't leave to grab lunch. There's a Papa Johns around the corner that we usually order from for company outings.   If anyone's willing.. I guess shoot me a PM and we'll work out the details?? I've never done this before...  
0	Exactly as the title says. Belt is tightened, but ramen sounds ghastly. Will be sure to pay it forward next month.
0	Been working all week last week and I don't get paid for it soon enough. during that week I stayed at a friend's empty eating nothing but rice with soy sauce since I was only paid 20 dollars for the week. The week before that wasn't swell either.  If anyone would help it'd be greatly appreciated, as I haven't had much of anything this week and I'm dying to get paid..
0	On 07/17/11 at 11:30 My wifey and I became parents for the first time.  We were not in great financial standing to begin with, but I have done everything I could over the last few months to buy things to have us ready for the baby, and everything is doing great there.  However, wifey is already starting to feel the post-partum depression setting in.  She feels like we will never be able to enjoy life again because money is a little tight right now.  We both have jobs, etc. so things will be better.  However the tastiest food we have had is Hamburger Helper made with 70/30 beef in the past week and a half.  And so, a random pizza would be great...  TL;DR New Baby, The mother is depressed because we are eating out of cans already, trying to lift her spirits.  Can provide proof of everything above.  EDIT 1: http://imgur.com/Ciums Photo of me holding my little girl after her first bath.  The Pooh robe was something Wifey said we HAD to buy.  It is pretty cute 
1	I get paid Thursday night, I'm down to a pack of Ramen.   Not making first payroll sucks. 
0	The last microwavable burrito was eaten last night :(  Now there are only condiments.  Between rent and medicine, there is no money left to buy food.  We feel pretty hopeless.  We will make a whole imgur album of her cute cats to thank you!  I love you, reddit!
1	I've been working for a month now, and only been paid minimally by one of my four jobs. I get paid by another one some time next week, but could use a bit of help. I've run through my savings and I'm in need of something besides ramen! I have a small amount of baht in my pocket, but I need it for gas to get around town to my jobs on my motorbike.  Pizzas in Thailand are only US$4, so a little help would go a long way!   I'll get you back with legit california style tacos from my kitchen after I get paid!   Important side note: I'm a cheese eating vegetarian.
0	Life is a hectic mess right now and eating on the cheap has had its merits, but if I eat one more egg or package of ramen I may cry. I've spent my last bit of money on moving to a new town to start fresh on life, and while things are good, I am craving a pizza like whoa.  Also, it'd be a bit of a celebration to having a job interview today. The pay increase would help oh so very much, so I'm crossing my fingers! Hopefully if the job comes through, I can pay it forward.  Thanks! &lt;3
1	College student, Just had out-patient surgery for moles that are being tested for carcinoma/melanoma. The Copay was more than I anticipated and have $16 in the bank left over (I can send verification of this, if requested). A Pizza would be great to help beat the pain that's starting to set in.   PapaJohns is my go to pizza place  Edit* Here I am all bandaged up! http://i.imgur.com/NeveQg8.jpg http://i.imgur.com/aiueFN2.jpg http://i.imgur.com/2whllQS.jpg 
1	And therefore couldn't swipe at the dining hall all day today, and I won't be able to get a new one until Monday. It's an enormous flaw in FSU's system. I am so hungry and have no money, and this community  is so impressive and wonderful. I would be so so so appreciative if someone would buy me dinner.
0	My roommate and I got a surprise from Comcast this month in that we got a service charge we were not aware of.  So the $30 I thought I would have extra this month is now gone. I'm in Fresno, CA
1	It's our last week of school and we wanted to celebrate somehow.  I suggested we all pool out money together and throw a pizza party.   So we did and turned it over to our SGR (Student Government Rep) who then had to get approval from the deacon.  But before he could somebody stole the money out of our SGR's room.  And now everybody is pissed and accusing the SGR of stealing our money which I don't think he did and everything is total shit.  I feel bad because it was my idea and because I've been defending the SGR they think I'm in on it too.      I know this is a big unlikely request.  But if someone or a group of someones could make it happen like magic you wouldn't just be feeding a bunch of hungry kids you'd be saving a lot of friendships.  
1	Any help would be appreciated, and reciprocated when I get paid in 2 weeks!
1	I've been awake for around 56 hours for a little experiment that I'm doing and a pizza would be so great. I'm not entirely in need and I'm not gonna starve to death or anything but I don't have any cash lying around to buy myself a pizza. I'm in Eastern Canada. If you guys don't feel like buying for me, at least go help someone else :) I'll pay it forward when I get the cash.
1	Hi there, well I am kinda hesitant about asking but I think the stomach is winning the war over pride. Long story short, had a roommate bail on me, owes me a bunch of monies. Financial aid for summer didn't go so far when my expenses for roof/power/water almost doubled. Hey but it's been great for aesthetics I've lost about 15 pounds since May. Its also been great for teaching me how to be more frugal, and learned to accept charity ( thank you whatever is above for food pantrys). I am moving soon, back home for the fall but I am down to $60 which has to last two weeks, and half of which will have to go to gas. I am in Las Cruces, NM. . . Have a code and such and a major hankering for some hot delicious pizza. Extra Karma bonus Points if you get them to draw a Pony on the box, preferably Pinkie Pie. . .
0	PM me if you are interested in helping me send my good friend and her girlfriend a delicious pizza pie. They both work minimum wage jobs, go to school and pay their own rent in NYC...just like a ton of other college kids out there. I just wanted to send some pizza love their way so they won't have to spend any more money than they already do.... Thanks all!
0	Louisiana native here. My bike broke down and I had to spend money to get it repaired at my shop... that being said, I'm broke now. I don't get paid until Wednesday so a pizza would really help keep me from going hungry for the next 3 days. 
0	It's pretty much just like the title says. My cousin and I will write stories for pizzas. We prefer fiction(non-fiction makes us think too much :P), but we will try anything. I might also convince her to draw a picture to go with the story.
0	[Charlie Boy](http://imgur.com/ahS6V) here decided not to pay up when finished with one of the local cat prostitutes, so the neighborhood pimp cat had to get involved. He put up a fight but was left with some gnarly battle scars. Maybe with the money I save I could afford to get him a kitty eye patch. To be honest though I've been out of work for a good three months and would love something other than ramen noodles tonight. (Broke college student). Much appreciated!
0	YES we just finished running our first ever 5K run around Arthur's seat in Edinburgh!!!! we are pretty knackered and need to regain the calories we lost running up those massive arthur hills in the scottish chilly breeze, my friends ears popped too so the experience wasnt so good for her at times. We would like some pizza please  thank you kindly!
0	Everyone I live with is either hours away or visiting family and i'm sitting here doing nothing.  
1	I could go on about how I'm a poor student. But really I'm just in the mood for some pizza after a hard days work.  That is what this subreddit is about, right?  :) 
0	Hello there. I've been having a horrible time the last few weeks in trying to find any kind of work and the frustration is killing me. My depression (dysthymia) has been hanging over me like a shroud. Some comfort food would help me with this gloomy feeling and also be a fun dinner for me and my mom tonight.   Incidentally we were helped earlier last year by a fellow NYer. I wish I can find her again so I can return the favor (free graphic design work, house cleaning etc). She gave me hope to not give up and take the easy way out of life's problems. 
0	Used up all my food bank visits for the month and have next to nothing to eat for the remainder of the month. Would someone be kind enough to help a brother out.?
0	I am a student in Atlanta. I am out of meals for my meal plan (i paid for it) and was just wondering if anyone could help me out today. I'm figuring out  my money situation now, but until I get funds, I can't eat. I would really appreciate anything at all.
0	Hello: I'm not going to try to make this a "SOB" Story lol but it's one long day until the 1st of the month, and the kids are sick and tired of hot dogs, mac and cheese and ramons noodles. We are very hungry for pizza.  It will hold us over soo much you can only imagine...  I'm praying that someone will really satisfy our tummies thanks so much for reading. This is the first time I've been on this site... Thank you...
0	It is a dreadful rainy day in Chico, and I have no current means of dry transportation. A hurricane of an empty stomach is howling at me, and the only cure I can think of is some tasty Dominos delivery. Please help me out, and someday in the future I shall return the favor to another in need of tasty round goodness.
0	I've been stuck in the library all day working on a research proposal/paper/presentation. Finally home (library closed) and I have about 200-300 pages of research articles sitting in my lap and still a lot to do before tomorrow. Would love a pizza, not too picky.
0	I just want a pizza :]
0	I just woke up from a pretty good night at the bar and pizza sounds delicious. I'm a singer/songwriter as a hobby and I'll trade you one acoustic song about the topic of your choice (I'll improv it), recorded as an MP3, for a pizza.  I'm in the Portland, OR area.
0	Just what the title says. Low on cash, unscheduled from my job, and my girlfriend left me, all within a couple weeks of one another. I've been struggling through job and internship applications, and trying to keep my head up, but it's not going great. My sleep and eating schedules have taken a dive as a result. Not to speak of my mood, most of the time. I'm not starving or anything, but it's a pretty rough situation.  If any kindly redditor would be willing to send a pizza my way (it'd be dinner tonight and lunch tomorrow), I'd be very grateful, and promise to pay it forward the moment I can afford to do so. If not, that's okay - someone on here probably needs it more than me.
0	So tomorrow I hit 19 (3/3/1993) and I'm having a party with a few friends of mine the day after. Unfortunately, I'm a college student and all my friends are in about the same situation. What I'm getting at is, we have no cash to do anything on Sunday. If a fellow Redditor were to hook us up with a pizza then I would go through their comments and upvote everything they've ever posted. What say you?
1	Hi amazing people! I've known of this subreddit's existence for awhile now, but have never participated. I guess now is the time, even though I'm on the other side of where I'd like to be. Currently, I'm very very hungry. I have no groceries in the house and unfortunately am going to have to wait until Thursday after 2pm (payday) to buy groceries again. I know that I could make a pizza last until then. If one of you guys could help me out, I'd be forever greatful! I'll even draw you a picture! I'm not an artist, but it's the thought that counts, right? I also pledge to return the favor sometime in the next three weeks! I have to give myself a little wiggle room because bills. Tons of bills.   Edit: I can definitely provide proof of my empty fridge and bank account!
0	So some details. I work at this call center and have to deal with people being furious at me for something that I am just now learning about. It can be quite frustrating at times. But you know what would make it better? Some pizza on my lunch break! And I'm broke until Friday unfortunately. Pizza would just make my day! I can send proof of the call center night mare job as well. Thanks to anyone in advance for just looking at this!... Annnddd maybe pizza?  Edit: my lunch starts at 7:15pm MST. 
0	Before I tell my story this is a throw away account, I don't want my friends to find out just how bad my family has it right now..  With that out of the way, I just want the chance for my family to eat something decent for a change.  Right now our house is going up for short sale, and we have to move out.  My parents couldn't afford the mortgage anymore, and Bank of America was completely unwilling to work with us in some kind of payment plan; so we're forced to sell and move.  If that wasn't bad enough, I just graduated college and can't get a job (been trying for months, every day; hours on end).   My step dad was in the hospital for a routine procedure and ended up contracting Sepsis.  So every six hours he has to attach an IV with ampicillin (some of the strongest anti-biotics you can take) so he's unable to work.  While he was in the hospital for almost three weeks, I was taking care of my siblings, making them dinner (which consists of 4-5 chicken nuggets every day..).  This is becoming quite long and I don't want to write a novel, but I'm really truly desperate right now for something to eat (besides nuggets).  I appreciate your time, reddit.  &lt;3
1	no money no food and hungry  a pizza would e nice =[
1	I'm not complaining or anything, I'm sure I'll get back on my feet soon, but as it is I'm broke as a joke (-95.47 in the bank), couch surfing, and hungry as hell. I could really use something to keep me from losing it here.
0	Hey there. I just found this subreddit yesterday. I don't have any money on my debit card right now, but I have cash. If someone wants to help me get a pizza here, I'll make sure the driver gets a $20 tip. Pm me!
0	Im not broke like many of the others in here, that being said I am on a college student budget and would love a pizza to help pull me through this all nighter I'm starting. Good luck to any other student that sees this!
0	Hi there awesome redditors!  I'm in need of food :(   I have been living off mcdoubles since the 25th of last month when my rental company forced us out of our rental 5 days early. Ramen and eggs are getting old, as well as dollar cheeseburgers.   I would love a pizza to thank a dear friend of mine for the $20 loan to pay my virgin mobile bill, paying him back tomorrow after selling plasma. Would be awesome to share.   I could repay you in house cleaning if your in the area, or if you need a personal chef for a night, I have references! Or I can draw you some awesomely cheesy artwork since I won't have cash to pay you back.  This is my first time posting in this sub, saw all the kindness and was really touched. Faith in humanity can rest easy on this sub's shoulders.   Sorry for rambling, just remembered this sub and thought it was worth a shot! Here's to hoping! Have a fantastic day :3 
0	Just down on my luck.  I lost my job and am struggling  to make ends meet. The kids and I would love some pizza. I will also pass it along once I am on my feet. I tried this before but no luck lol  Umm dont know what else to say.  HAPPY 4th of July!  I hope this works this time, but if not I understand there are many in need and I think this board is a great idea and hope it stays around a long time. You ppl are truely nice ppl and I wish you all the best.
1	Hey there everyone. I hate asking for handouts but things are a little tight right now after traveling for the holidays and I had barely enough to cover my rent this month. All I have in the kitchen is some ramen and nasty chicken rice stuff. If anyone would be so kind as to get me some pizza tonight I'll repay them once I get paid, or if you'd prefer I'll buy someone else here some pizza.  Thanks Reddit
1	I received a pizza from this sub-reddit about 8 months ago. Just wondering if anyone is willing to help again?
0	I'm a happy college student trying to study for orgo, but knowing that wont happen, I'm willing to paint you guys a picture using, get this, GLOW-IN-THE-MOTHER-F***ING-DARK paint. So ill draw you something in exchange for pizza!
1	Well today sucked. Hardcore. It seemed like everyone was in a super bad mood, and I was the only positive person... Got a lot of hate today. I'm also broke, and not getting paid tell the end of the week, and like I said, its only Monday. Anyone want to cheer me up?
0	Our roommates are probably about to cook something tasty that they will not be willing to share as we are not on the best of terms with each other. I think a large pepperoni pizza and one of our Blu-Rays would make for an enjoyable night. Thanks, guys.
1	I'm nearly out of money and I'm running out of time. I lost my job in January and need pizza soon or else my New Year's resolution is a bust. I DO have a job interview tonight at 7:30 p.m. (EST) and it'd be nice not to go on an empty stomach. Reddit, could you kill two of my birds with one stone by ordering me a pizza so I can eat lunch AND dinner?!
0	Every other paycheck goes almost entirely to rent for my studio apartment in the city. The leftover cash went straight to bag of food for the pup- the light of my world. I could sure use a pizza though.. Not even a box of noodles in the pantry. I would sure appreciate it :) and I can return the favor on the 15th or later!
0	It's a hungry day at the office (i'm self employed) and i'd be willing to do some web design work for you to show my immense gratitude. I can most likely complete whatever kind of project you need. 
0	He lives in Jackson, MI. I'm kind of new to the whole pizza offers, so if you need anything else just ask.
0	I live in California and my boyfriend lives in Colorado. He lost his job and is struggling to pay bills. He can only eat when I send him money, please please please send him a pizza! Comment or send me a message if you're interested! Thanks in advance :)
1	Due to my own financial stupidity, and some bad timing, the entire paycheck that I receive tonight will go towards rent/late fees/utilites (specifically, water and trash.)  If anyone decides that I am in any way worthy of a pie, I will ration it off for as long as I need to (I have a few canned vegetables that will do as well.)  I will gladly pay anything back/forward, and do simple requests.  I live in Raleigh, North Carolina.  I appreciate anything in advance, even if just looking.  Gracias, amigos/as!  
1	I don't normally ask for things from people, especially ones I don't know, but this subreddit seems pretty awesome..  My backstory: I'm a 24 year old single dad with full custody of my 5 year old. Things have been really tight for years..pretty much since I graduated high school. I pay for everything on my own and between rent, car payment, utilities, groceries, and a $440 daycare bill every month there isn't much left. His mother chips in $75/month which doesn't even pay for a week of daycare.   Anyway, my son starts elementary school next week and is scared to death. Would love to surprise him with a pizza :]  Since I won't be having that massive daycare bill next month I will gladly pay it forward!
0	Trying to hang, but severe stomach pangs are making it hard, and our jester pockets are, alas, empty.
0	It's my 22nd birthday today. Last night I moved into a place with my friend and we don't have much to celebrate with. Help make my birthday a little less lame, please.   Also, my fiance is 29 weeks pregnant and craving pizza.   There is a Pizza Hut within walking distance so we can pick up. Anything would be greatly appreciated!  Thanks for your time!
1	I know I haven't been very active on this site, but I thought I'd give this a shot. I've been out of steady work for about a year now, and this is the first time in 8 years I won't be able to go home for Christmas. I miss my family, miss my friends, miss my steady paycheck, and tonight I'm just plain hungry. Whether this pans out or not, I intend to fulfill another Redditor's request as soon as financially feasible.
1	[Pizza received]  Thanks Llamacat21!!  We've also got a broken down vehicle we are needing to pay for and zero food in the house. We're tired of shoving random crap in stale tortillas and are just looking for some decent food. Please help feed us. My girlfriend's an artist and I'm sure she'd be willing to draw up a decent thank you! 
0	Okay I'm not going to lie- I'm addicted to cheese and I've been struggling hard this week. I received a hefty bill and so needs must. But now I'm getting the withdrawals...im bleary eyed and craving hard. Is anyone able to help me!?! Would be greatly appreciated :D I get paid on the 28th of the month but would gladly return the favour! EDIT #1: I should mention I'm in the UK. EDIT #2: I should also mention its been almost a week since I've had any kind of 'tasty' food....please!!!
1	would be a great surprise for my son to have pizza tonight! 
1	I'm a college student pulling an all nighter to study for finals. I'm pretty much broke at this moment I have $6.29 in my account and a dollar in my pocket. I would appreciate it if someone would send me a pizza. Please and thank you!
0	I don't have much in the cupboards, I have no transport and it's pouring down with rain that won't stop for a few days... A Random Act of Pizza would be like a blessing from above! (geographically speaking, America appears to be 'above' New Zealand on the world map :P)
0	Hi, just craving pizza so much, for myself and two children, we live near Papa Ginos! Will pay it forward asap!
0	Okay no really, we're just hungry and we don't have any cash.  If we should receive a pizza we will pass it on soon!
1	I'll write a poem, sing a song, do a dance, play an instrument, whatever! I just want a pizza. (By the way, skype would be preferred so i can deliver my end of the deal."
0	Hey folks, I was just wondering if there was anyone out there who would be generous enough to hook me up with a pizza! It'd make a nice break from ramen while I wait for the next check and can buy my own pizzas!
0	One of my close friends is in need of some guy time, his family moved back east and after his uncle committed suicide last week he's been a little torn up (he had to go to the funeral alone). I would like to give him some solid man grieving time. A friend gave me some beer from a party he threw last week but if someone could give me a coupon to Papa Johns I promise to do the same next month.  I'm running short this month due to some legal fees I had to pay and some of the extra money I make as a contractor won't get into my bank account till the end of the month. All in all this is just shitty timing.
0	Somebody would brighten up my day a lot. We were engaged but he decided that he just didn't care anymore. I honestly hate asking for help, but I guess this is an exception. It's pretty loserly, but Reddit has been one of the only things I have to get me through the day. 
1	I'm off work today and have no money to cookout.A pizza would be a generous offer from a nice redditor.
0	I just received my Bachelor of Science in Statistics this past week. I would love some free pizza to accompany my evening of video games! 
1	Hi. These last two weeks have sucked, and I would really appreciate not worrying about one thing--namely, food--after all the torrential bad events I've experienced. In short:  * Moved out of my dorm, physically exhausting myself by lugging all my physical belongings up three flights of stairs.   * Learned my grandma has likely-fatal leukemia  * Got rejected.  * Car broke down. Towed for all the money in my checking. Problem not found, magically starts running again.  * Had to miss a week of work due to lack of transportation--less money, more problems  * Discovery that I can't cook well, and I don't have the cash to spend to improve my cooking skills (read: buy a cookbook, or a good square pan, or microwavable dinners).  * My other grandmother, the gentlest woman I will ever meet and the guiding role model in my life, passes away suddenly.   * Car breaks down again. AGAIN. Fortunately, it magically restarts AGAIN, and I don't have to have it towed. But it's almost guaranteed now that whatever is going wrong is going to be expensive.  * I get a sunburn from the funeral, and a mysterious rash from apparently holding a rabbit.  * Grades come back. I am officially beneath the required GPA necessary to keep my scholarship.   Aside from the food courtesy of the funeral, I haven't had a decent meal in maybe a month due to stress, finals, and lack of cooking skills. I would like to have a few days where I don't worry about hunger.  
1	I've got my story just like everyone, I would rather tell you privately though. If you are looking for someone to send a pizza too, I would be grateful!    I'll of course pay if forward one day when I can!
1	If anyone has a $5 GC to dominos i could get a small pizza. In return I could put on my best santa voice and pretend to be santa for your kids. HO HO HO!
1	Happy Birthday to Me
0	Could use a cheesey slice of heaven right now. If someone helps me out then when I get paid I'll help another out. There isn't much info here because I hate begging but I could really use the help. 
1	I have very little in the bank right now, only make enough to actually pay my rent, and have almost no food in my house. Didn't get to spend much time with my family this year. I'm an out-of-state student so I didn't even actually get to go home and have been here job hunting. None of my roommates are in town so I've been by myself for a while. Can anyone help a girl out? I would be infinitely grateful!  Also, I'm not really sure how this works, have never requested anything before. If you would like me to PM you anything else I would be more than happy to. Just don't want to put a lot of personal information for all to see. :/ Thank you so much. This community is the greatest.
0	Local purveyor of pizza slices, [Luigi's Slice] (https://www.facebook.com/luigisfungarden), has $2 pepperoni and cheese slices on Tuesdays. While I could have procured one of these, it would've left me flat broke for the rest of the week. Last night, willpower was working overtime, and I pulled through.  ... This morning, I just had a bowl of Grape Nuts â which I typically do enjoy â but for whatever reason, the image of Luigi's perfectly spiced oregano-laden sauce stabbed my brain, and subsequently my gut, relentlessly.  Today is $3 for any slice, and I feel my willpower waning hard. At this point, any pizza would suffice â it is merely convenient (and awesome) that the cheaper option is also among the best in the area.  Any help to satisfy this pizza craving would be much appreciated, I promise to pay it forward (in-kind, to the extent I'm able) by next $2 Tuesday!
0	i'm an fiu student with .30 cents in my bank account for the next week craving some pizza to munch on while i work my way through a twelve page paper. everything on campus where i could use my meal plan is closed. help a girl out?
0	Pretty much like the title says. Things are pretty grim around here, and some pizza could really brighten the day (or night, as it is...)   I hope I'm doing this right. I've never been in this position before.  Oh, and I'm in North Texas.
0	My friend told me about this sense things have been a little tight lately due to a separation between me and my wife, enough sob story(herd you guys aren't big on those) but i would love to surprise my daughter tonight with her favorite a bacon and jalapeno  pizza while we watch nightmare before Christmas.  So if someone would be kind enough to help in my attempt to keep her mind off her me and her mother i would be more then happy.  And i will be sure to help someone else when i get paid on Friday.  Thank you all for being awesome!
1	Hello! My son (8) and I are were just talking about Pizza, he loves it. (of course!) We live within or means and don't eat out often, but he is making me crave Pizza now. I then remembered this little nook on Reddit. It's our first time requesting, and I will offer when I have the extra cash! =) Here's our pic! http://imgur.com/9n55g and we have a verification code! Thank you! 
0	Fail
0	Hi Everyone,  This is my first try at this.  We have a family of seven and are just running a little short this week until payday on Tuesday.  We would really appreciate a pizza or two tonight so that we can get off the Ramen binge this weekend.  If you'd like to help us out, please feel free to ask whatever questions you might have.    Thanks, Jason 
0	I live at home with my mom and sister and my mom just got out of the hospital with diabetes related gang green on her leg and we have no food in the house and no money until the first of next month.  We live near Warsaw IN and it would be very helpful if we could get a pizza.
0	I'm 22, I live on my own. I ran out of work in the beginning of December. ...been living off of what I can. Unfortunately I ran out of food a couple days ago....I need to eat something. I will buy you a pizza and I'll also find you a cat who has a pony as a best friend as soon as I can!  Thank you!
0	I just got into bellingham this morning, trying to find a job on a fishing boat, and ended up spending several days worth of money on the taxi/hotel so i could have a recuperating night. anyone willing to float a pizza my way? i'll most definitely pay it forward when i get setup. plus i'll love you. 
1	Hello. I have received once before in an offer post. I'm humbly asking again if someone could assist us with a pizza. We just got back from swimming practice and we're pretty hungry. We have some buttered noodles to hold us over, but we're pretty sick of those.   :P    Thank you. 
0	My husband and I have been in a bad situation financially for...well....a long time. Personally, I haven't really been in a "good" financial situation my whole life. He hasn't been employed for over 2 years (except for a part time job he had for a little bit) and I worked full time to barely make ends meet. I got fired. We couldn't pay our bills to begin with. Pizza would be a great pick me up considering that our cupboards are bare and I've been waiting a month for my unemployment which STILL hasn't come in...and I still have no idea when they will decided I can have some money or even if I'm going to get anything...and April 8th was my birthday. I can't remember the last holiday that I have actually been able to celebrate with more than a "oh look at that its (my birthday, Chanukah, Valentines Day, Our Anniversary, etc.)...thats nice". I would really like to surprise my husband with a pizza.  Thank you guys for even reading this, its good to know that there are good people out there who care about others. :) Hopefully my luck will improve (it better! its been years!) and I can return the favour.
0	Going to start college soon and I'm chilling with my friends and we could use a pizza. Not to mention we have to hurricane coming here on the east coast so we may be without power tomorrow. If you want to give me some pizza that would be great!  Edit: location Eastern Mass I can be more specific if need be!
1	She is getting rather old and I moved in with her to help around the house, lift heavy things, drive her to bingo, etc...   long story short. Im poor, yadda yadda who cares..... Her cooking isnt what it used to be....    I WANT A PIZZA...  Thanks yall... 
0	I'm broke for the next week or so, and food reserves are dwindling. A pizza would really make my day. 
0	Now I know just straight up asking for a pizza isn't really inventive or innovative, but I'm kinda just without any money at all and could go for one or two, saving the slices for a meal every so often. I think you can probably buy a pizza online from the Pizza Hut or Dominos NZ branch near me from anywhere in the world, but if you're in NZ that's even cooler. Anyway, yeah. Thanks in advance. I can give you my Steam name and we can have a few games to celebrate if you want, or I could give a little thanks on my Youtube channel if that's what you'd like. I can't really offer much other than that, but yeah, enough rambling. I guess PM me if you're willing? :D
0	Caught her sleeping with boss.  Springfield Missouri area.  Thanks.
0	I am taking the GRE this week, so in the midst of midterms I am also studying for this test that will determine the next several years of my life, and ultimately, my career. I don't really have the time or money to deal with food at the  moment. I'm also a small girl, and a pizza will last me several days. Thanks for reading.  Edit: Forgot location... Idaho!
1	its just me and my 9 year old daughter tonight.we plan on watching christmas movies.she got real good grades on her report card and would like to suprise her with a pizza.thanks
0	I just came back from vaction, now I'm broke. This has put a damper on my plan to lure Batman to my house to learn his ways. There are 4 people who live here and I am trying to get enough pizza to feed them and, with any luck, attract the Dark Knight himself to join in the festivities. I have requested pizza on this site before and have recieved a gift card. But at the time I couldn't use it so I donated it to someone else who needed it more than I did (not unlike the Caped Crusader would have done). I would be grateful for any help.
0	Hey.  We don't have any power and could really use a pizza.  Much thanks.
1	I just finished my last two finals today and have nothing to do until graduation. In one of my last acts of being a broke college kid, I would love to spend the rest of my night with a pizza and some old school video games. It would be greatly appreciated!
0	Anyone wanna make me look like the best boyfriend ever? She's vegetarian =/
1	Hi,       Its the end of the month, hubby and i would love to have a pizza on Friday or tonight :) It's been a while since we had the pleasure of cheeses and bacon.   I am new to this so hopefully I did this request right.   Edit: Just got my egift card for a pizza with Papa Johns from Masterboat seriously thank you so much! We really apperciate it!!!! 2nd Edit: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/87uIp.jpg)  Here is a photo of our yummy pizza. It was super awesome and the bacon was the best part. Thanks again masterboat!  
0	and my first week off since January (aside from spring break). Between a non-paid internship at a local newspaper, school, freelance work for bills, I find myself sitting here broke gaming on my computer for the first time in ages. The only thing that could make this better, is some pizza from a generous fellow Redditor. Reddit pls. 
0	I'm a software developer who is working on contract work week to week and this week... things came up slightly short.  My girlfriend has come over to my place for the evening and she just expressed the want for a pizza and as I sit here looking at my bank account I've realized I'm overdrawn for the week thanks to the dentist.  So I've come looking for a pizza. After being a long time Reddit lurker I've registered and decided it is time to see what happens with this.  Don't worry... I'm verified.
0	I'm sick in bed with the flu .. my boys have taken such great care of me I'd love to treat them to some pizza
0	The three of us live in a tiny house (dubbed: The Hobbit Hole) and all are bicycle mechanics in the area. Obviously, it is not the most profitable of seasons for us- although I have taken on a job working the door at a local bar (as has another of my roomates), as well as an after school assistant in a town nearby. But Paychecks are two weeks away, and will finally make life easy again! Two of us are finishing getting our degrees.   It's been a long day, and we Just managed to scrape rent together, but don't really have a great amount of food in the house (save some rice, eggs and oatmeal, that we need to save for the rest of the week and until our next paychecks)   We Just really want to enjoy a pizza together on a sunday night!   Thanks RAOP!
1	yeah, I'm having some bad luck. Kind of hoping for a miracle here. Bare minimum cheese if you're willing. thanks a million.
0	It's been a rough summer here. It may be cold in the D but it's pretty cold in Flint Town too. My roommate totaled his car, we were living five deep in here paying 100/person in rent and 3/5 roommates moved out this week.  We are both unemployed at the moment, I just got hired in somewhere but I won't get paid  for another two weeks.  We are kind of shitting bricks about what we are going to eat.  All of our money is going to utilities, and to pay rent.  If there is a kind redditor out there who could extend some sort of relief my roommate and I would be so incredibly grateful.  We just need a little bit of relief until we can get some food assistance.
0	hey there, i would appreciate it if anybody could help me out with a pizza. i'm broke until payday and after a 15-hour workday i'm too worn out for cooking. love you reddit! 
0	I just had to slap down two full paychecks for a rental house deposit so this week has been clear out the fridge/freezer time. Unfortunately I've already run out of things to eat. :( I could easily make a medium pizza last me for lunches at work till payday, when I fully intend on returning the favor for anyone else who is in the same temporary bind that I am. Even if I don't get a pizza!  Gotta say I just learned about this subreddit a few days ago and this is an amazing system everyone's got going here. The standup folks outnumber the scumbags by a lot, and I want to jump in and give back to such a giving small community as soon as I'm able.
0	My roommate and I are college seniors, finals week. We're both pretty much out of food aside from a few cans of soup and oatmeal. Some pizza tonight would be AMAZING. I will also pledge to return the favor in three weeks when I'm back home and working. Swearsies. [This is us](http://i.imgur.com/yYfXD.png) (sorry for the duckface)
0	Long story short my fiance is the only girl in a warehouse full of men that build high end mountain bikes ( Santa Cruz Mountain Bikes )....I planned on surprising her by having a pizza delivered to her station tomorrow for lunch but then I realized her place of work is full of hungry hard working people who would love to get the same treatment......well Reddit what do you think? can we make this happen 
0	Not in the mood to cook, have a lot of stuff going on and dinner won't be ready til ten pm So please help me out with a pizza :)
0	corinth, tx  in between classes. hard to study with a stomach like tis. willing to pay it foreward friday when i get my college disbursement.
1	If someone could hook me up with a $15 gift card I would happily hook someone up with pizza tomorrow. Here is the link to the Papa Johns promotion http://www.papajohns.com/touchdown/  Thanks Reddit! &lt;3
0	Hey there! I'm new here, and quite pregnant. My name is Cori. I got myself a verification code, whatever that means. I'm active on RAOAmazon. I'm new here, though. I'm on PERMANENT BEDREST until I'm induced in December. I have preeclampsia, which means for no reason than my body hates my baby, I have extremely high blood pressure and I could have a seizure at any moment. (Both my mom and my grandma lost their first children to eclampsia, the onset of the seizures, so I'm GRATEFUL to have knowledge of my condition. The docs say my baby and I should be TOTALLY fine!)  Sorry for the sob story, I know that's not what this wonderful place is about, but I just thought I'd let you know background to WHY I want a pizza! I'm off of work, obvs, because I have to be in bed all day (no more than 5 minutes on my feet at a time!), and ALSO, **my husband can't cook for SHIT**, so I'd like to take some responsibility off of him for the next two nights or so by getting him a fat pizza gift card! We have all the normal joints in our neighborhood, so any gift card would be sweet!  It would help make sure myself and my unborn child are fed something that wasn't burnt and scraped off of the bottom of the wrong pan for the occasion!  Thanks in advance for your
0	I don't really have much of a sob story, I just don't really have much cash and could really go for some pizza. For the random aspect, i can draw some random request (albiet it probably won't be very good) for whoever =)
0	Reddit can i please have a pizza for my day late birthday ._. idk what to say but thanks for taking a look. can provide proof of birthday. 
1	I have been hard at work trying to catch I_rape_cats and would like some pie to feed myself and the two other rapist catchers.   Just kidding, were not really looking for I_rape_cats! My kids and I are at home and would love some pie. Its about dinner time and when asked they said they wanted pizza. We just spent our "Entertainment" money on stuff for our foster dog that we took in from a local private dog shelter. He is a shy dog and was beaten severely so were trying to make him in to a vital part of our pack so he can someday be adopted by a family that needs a loving kind dog.   Lets not get stuff twisted, we have food and will not starve. However, we would like to get some pizza.   Thanks to everyone that offers anyone pizza on here. each and everyone of you make a difference in someones day. 
1	So if you check my history you'll see in the last three weeks my credit card was skimmed, my car window busted, stitches put in my back without insurance, etc. etc.  Today I just got my electric bill. $320 dollars because my 17 year old thermostat decided it'd be cool to run the AC and heat at the same time. I work part time for a non-profit that doesn't pay much. With everything that's happened, I am tapped out and will be for a couple months. A pizza can probably last me three days of leftover goodness.   I've been making the most of noodles, rice, and such from the Food Bank for the past week. I'm hungry and I hate scammers. I intend to pay it forward. I have no problems using the verification code/PMing my address/sending you a printscreen of the adorable graph on my bill quadrupling/etc.  Thank you friends.
0	My work laid me off and my funds are quite tight at the moment. I've been eating a spartan diet and would really appreciate a pie; it would make my week. I'm in Canada so I'm not sure if my location will muck up the works, but it can be done then I sure would appreciate it. Thanks in advance.  Edit: I'd like to cancel my request.   I have a pal IRL that has spotted me some funds for a pie and even bought be some groceries. I'm touched by their kindness and look forward to paying it forward.   I hope anyone that felt inclined to buy me a pie would invest their kindness somewhere else on this subreddit or IRL!
0	Hello everyone. School is out today and I wanted to treat my kids to some pizza for lunch, I heard about this site through my neighbor and figured I could give it a shot. It is not a need , I do have soup for them. I just wanted to surprise them since they work so hard. I just don't have it right now. I am willing to return the pizza happiness next week. Thanks for reading. Have a wonderful day!
0	I have friends who come over every Sunday for our weekly table top. We always order food or cook a meal for the group. None of us are needy, but I see a potential to get them involved with RAOP.   If pizza shows up at our game with no knowledge of the players, it would be "magical" and would make them all aware of the RAOP. More importantly, they would now be inclined to participate.   So, yeah. No one is needy/broke etc, I just wanted to start of a chain of action from our Table Top Adventurers. :)  **Edit: I have no idea how to clarify that this is no longer needed since the time past. I saw that the moderators don't want these things deleted so...**
0	Finally created an account on reddit for this post alone, basically the situation is that I was paid on friday, and my bank (Arizona Federal Credit Union) has placed a hold my payroll check for a couple of days now. I was told that it would be included in my "available balance" 6pm MST, however it has still not shown up. The banks are now closed, my account in still negative, and I am stuck at work till 11 pm. I was counting on ordering something once the funds were available, but alas I will be hungry tonight. Unless there is a kind soul out there who responds to this message.   P.S. - This is the first time I have done something like this, and would love to repay the favor for someone tomorrow. Its a lot easier on my conscious if I consider this a loan, rather than a freebie. Thanks again!
1	Worked at a small software solutions company as a recruiter in HR. The company decided my position should have someone with more experience, and that meant I was no longer qualified for my job (was entry level, became 3+ yrs experience required). To make it worse, I was laid off 1 hour before the company handed out iPads to all the employees as a Christmas gift.  Edit: Atlanta, GA
0	I'm 21, live in North Carolina, and currently my checking account has $16.61 in it.  I'm a college student at UNC, and I quit my job in February to try and start a business (I'm a business major). Things are moving much slower than I expected, but nobody said it would be easy. I think I have a chance to make some money this coming week, but until then this is what I'm stuck with.  I've never been in this place before, I've always had some kind of job since I started working in high school, so I've always had some backup cash. Well once school runs out and the loans are dry here I am, pretty fucked. Dad's helping with rent and bills each month, but I'm ashamed as it is to take money from him, I can't possibly ask for more until he offers it, especially since he tells me they've cut his pay at his current position.  My roommate has been out of town too, and she owes me $50 for her half of the electric, but won't be back in town until Tuesday. Meanwhile, I sit here in the apartment working, trying not to leave lest I spend money or gas, with a near empty kitchen. And I've just run out of bud too. . .  I really enjoy just plain cheese pizza, or maybe cheese and bacon or something simple. It's the simple, little things in life anyway.
0	Right around the new year, a friend and I both found ourselves unexpectedly and suddenly needing new places to live. Neither one of us was financially able to find a rental on no notice, so instead, we pooled our resources and moved into a seriously crappy hotel off the highway in a rotten part of town that had a weekly rate we could afford.  Fast forward 2 months and the hotel's being renovated by corporate and they've decided to boot everyone with one week's notice. We panic appropriately, pool our cash again, manage to just barely afford a room share that seems like it'll be awesome, but it leaves us flat broke (we have a cup full of pennies; that's it) till Monday. Weeks of ramen are doing us in, and a pizza... mmm... piiiiizza... would let us relax and maybe enjoy the evening instead of sniping at each other and feeling vaguely hungry.   I'd be in a position to pay this forward on Monday--and would. Tonight is just all kinds of suckage.
0	It's been my toughest semester yet, having to work overtime just to pay basic bills (all of which I'm still behind on, of course) on top of going to school full time. My last final was yesterday and it would be nice to have some kind of reward!
0	We came to Anaheim for the Vex 2013 World robotics competition. Now we are back at the place we are staying and looking to eat some pizza.  Thanks in advance.  
1	Current situation: So, for the last two weeks, things haven't been so great. Not only have I've been fighting a bad cold for over 3 weeks, my wallet has been stolen, my pet has died, and I was denied a job interview because I'm going to school. For the past 2 to 3 days, I have been eating sparingly out of 4"x7" box of leftovers from a friend's dinner party.  I hate asking for things, but, I am really hungry. I would greatly appreciate it if someone could help me out. Thank you.  Update: [ActionEra](http://www.reddit.com/user/actionera) saved me!! :D Thank you everybody for reading. If you guys know how to put a [Received] in the title, let me know. 
1	Our power is out, my other 3 roommates have family in the area to stay with except for me.  I have no way to cook and can't afford to go to a restaurant until I get paid. please help if you can! 
1	I have 4 more days until payday, and I am back on my feet. I'm currently almost done what ever food I have left, which has been bread and peanut butter. I hate to ask this, but can anyone help me with pizza tonight? I am a huge believer in paying it forward, I would gladly do the same for anyone in my position. I just need some help these last few days.  -Thanks to whoever takes the time out and reads this. :) 
0	Ok so basically, I'm a hungry motherfucker who wants some god damn pizza, but can't be fucked to pay for it because I'm a lazy cunt, plus I just spent a fuck ton on pornhub subscriptions, so a pizza would be appreciated, plus if you buy me a pizza I will give you an internet/reddit high five.
1	This is my first and only time doing this, but I have a good friend a couple of states away in TN whos life isn't going to well right now. She is responsible for saving me from myself a few years ago and is a great person. Her life isn't going so well right now and she needs a good cheering up. I really don't want to come off as begging, but I don't have the money to do this right now. Dominos is the only place in the area that delivers to her house. She LOVES pizza. If anyone can help with this, well that'd be really great. 
0	I just found this site through CNN.  I am deeply touched reading all of these posts.  Both from those in need, and those looking to help.  It is amazing to see people helping each other this way.  There was a point when getting a pizza meant nothing.  It was more of an escape from cooking for the night then a special treat.  Those days are long gone.  In the last year I've gone through a divorce and lost my job.  I do get unemployment, but I'm $500 in the negative every month with just the standard bills, not counting gas or food.  It's a round robin of who gets payed each month based on the impending shut-off notice.  TV service is long gone, and we wouldn't have the internet if not for it being a major part of the job hunt.  We've learned to live on what we have, and I'm grateful to say my kids are too young to fully appreciate where are at four and five.  I make sure they're fed, but I can never give them anything above and beyond that.  It would just be really amazing to be able to surprise them with a pizza some night.  Believe me, I know how fortunate I am to have a roof over our heads, and a car that works right most of the time.  And there are people I'm sure who need so much more than we do.  And as soon as I'm in a position to help them, I guarantee I'm going to be on here doing that.  God bless all of you.
0	Hey, lets just throw some info out here first, im 16 and dont live with my father and am going to meet my mother next month, and i currently have no money and no food and i have a MAAAAD craving for some pizza.  So if someone would give me a random act of pizza before im homeless it would be much appreciated and i would give just as much back to the board when everything is stabilized again. Thanks in advance, even if you dont.   *Edit* Also, i live in Ontario Canada if that helps any.
1	Title says it all. I'm a poor college student helping my boyfriend move into a new place, and we'd love a pizza to share tonight! Thanks!
0	I'm not by a long shot the most deserving candidate on RAoP, but it has been awhile since I've had anything but cafeteria slop.      A hot greasy pizza sounds awesome.       In New Zealand, closest place is [Domino's](http://www.dominospizza.co.nz/). 
0	It'll be another couple of weeks until my boyfriend gets his paycheck from his new job, and my income isn't really able to support two people so we've eaten a lot of rice and ramen lately. I've been craving pizza so bad that I've finally gotten the nerve to ask you fine folks to help a girl out (which makes me feel slightly less guilty than asking my parents for $20).   I will definitely pay you back, or pay it forward if you prefer (probably both) as soon as I am able.  (Pontiac, MI)  
1	Have my 2 boys with me until thursday, Im a on call building cleaner r here in florida, work has been very very slow. Wanted to see if there was anybody who can give a little help until thursday where im guaranteed work my sons will greatly appreciate it. 
0	I did go out to eat last night to bond with my stepsister and I spent my emergency money and then I gave away my left overs to a beggar. I had such good pasta and bread in there man.
1	I have been away from my husband for what seems like years even though its been like 4 months. We live in different countries so getting all the paperwork in order had taken a toll on our wallets. Luckily my sister and grandmother let me move into their apartment that they just got here in Dallas, Texas. My sister was working in a emergency pet hospital that shut down two month ago. She's at a new job now, but for the last month we have been struggling with finances to keep all three of us a float and especially keeping our pets fed before us! Us three would just be super grateful to have something besides dry pancakes this week, until the first of us sees a paycheck.
1	I am a nursing student in south eastern North Carolina. I am 29 years old, and I have 5 children. I was expecting to have my financial aid refund check this past week, but got an email last Wednesday that because I had a class that started late, I will not get my check until the middle of July. We budget very carefully to have money for everything, and this has really put us in a bind. We do get food stamps, but because they changed the date of disbursement for July, we've had to really stretch our food budget to make it through until then. We won't starve without pizza, but it would be nice to treat my kids, since I had promised them we would go out for a nice dinner when my check came. I can, and will help someone out in a few weeks when I get my refund. Thank you if anyone wants to help. :)
0	My Girlfriend doesn't believe there are actually people who would give away pizzas. So as a bet, I told her if someone wanted to send one, she has to take a picture for the ROAP sender... There choice, anything goes. Can send pictures of what were working with upon request. 1 Time Deal!
0	Hey all,   I'm afraid I don't really have a story.  My roommates and I take turns buying groceries for the week.  This week is their week, but they are out of town seeing family.  The kitchen is very empty.  Obviously, they'll make it up to me upon their return, but until that time I am on my own.   Unfortunately, I don't get paid from my regular job until Friday (and those of you who might recognize my username know I generate no income from my YouTube/Twitch channels), and the truth is I just can't afford to go grocery shopping until then.  I am almost positive I can make what I have left stretch to Friday, but if anyone is feeling generous I would be most appreciative for any assistance.   Looking back, I guess that kind of is a story.  Sorry about that.   -Pounce
0	I run a Auto shop in CT and it's been a really slow few weeks. We've been eating ramen and honey buns all week and would love to pig out on a big greasy cheesy pizza. Can anyone help us out today? Thanks for the love!!!
0	I love reading Wired, but this is something else.
0	We hold Starcraft King of the Hill tournaments and select a winner. Let me know if you want to help us out by blessing him with a random act of pizza. We had over 122 tickets in the raffle:  http://i.imgur.com/Ip4w8.png &lt;-- Different social networks that played entered  Here is a VOD of the event that happened a few hours ago cued to the time when we picked the winner:  http://www.twitch.tv/rcraftgaming/b/313640366?t=3h58m4s  We love the idea of reddit helping reddit, but I understand if you guys may not approve and please let me know what you think of the concept. Our raffle and tournament are reddit organized from /r/starcraft via the rCraftGaming people.  Thanks you!
0	I unfortunately am having to spend the holidays alone, which included my birthday, this december. I made sure the fiancee could go see her family that is visiting from korea and i stayed home with our pup and am voluntarily working the holidays so that coworkers can be with family since i am unable to this year. I used my last funds to get the fiancee to her grandpas and won't have any more until after the new year. A pizza would make a really awesome meal for me and would keep me from having to munch on plain rice for atleast tonight and tomorrow :)
1	Hey RAOP'rs!  I lost my job about a month ago, and luckily I found a new one right away.  However, it was a $1/hour paycut AND I only get half the hours I used to get.  I had to use my entire first paycheck to pay utilities, phone bill, and the money I owed on my (store) credit card (good credit &gt; fun things).    I (luckily) have a pantry full of pasta (I decided that $10/10 boxes of pasta was a good idea a few months ago and that's a lot of pasta) and a few cans of beans and half of a 5lb bag of rice, as well as sauces and syrups for those guys.  I also have a lot of baking things.  I'm definitely not short on food, but it's getting a bit monotonous eating only this, especially since I have to do it 'till next Thursday.  I only have $16 until next Friday's paycheck and I'd like to spice up my life with a treat this weekend!  I live in Minneapolis and I'm in the delivery area of Pizza Hut, Papa John's, Domino's, and a local favorite (though much more expensive), Pizza Luce.  If anyone's willing to order me a medium cheese or pepperoni pizza for carryout or delivery (I can pay tip with the $2 I found on my way home yesterday if it's delivery, or I can bus/bike to pick up from any of those locations!) I would love you forever!  I don't owe rent next month (because I had to pay the last month of rent when I signed my lease) so I will be passing it on as soon as I get my paycheck!  Thanks so much!
1	I got left behind this year.  My brother went to his friend's house.  My parents went to New York.  I was told my sister would be having a Thanksgiving dinner at her apartment, but that didn't happen.  So now it's just me and my dog with the house to ourselves.  I got some Hot Pockets in the freezer, but it seems kind of sad to eat that on Thanksgiving.    Also, I guess I should include a location.  Santa Clarita, CA.
0	As the title suggests, I will make a brand new instrumental track or remix   right now, any genre, sample something, remix something, etc. for pizza.   I'm pretty good at it. If you're disappointed, then no pizza for me.  I'm just broke, bored, hungry and on crutches.    Edit: I'm in Northern California.
0	My bank account balance is negative and I have a craving for pizza. Humbly requesting some help with dinner.
0	Wabash, Indiana. Family is away so i'm sitting at home browsing Reddit and I get hungry. Pizza sounds glorious!
1	Hey guys so I just heard about this subreddit, it's crazy how great of a community this is. So I've been watching over my younger sister and 2 brothers (10, 8 &amp; 7 respectively). For the past 6 weeks now, we've been staying at my mother's house while she's away. I love em Im a lot older so i took care of all three since they were babies I'm almost like an uncle haha. I've been paying all the bills except the rent. I work part time as a janitor while they're at school but have to be at the bus stop when they get off every day. On food stamps so we get by but we're running low and they honestly don't get a treat like this often. So yeah I don't want to post a whole story of my life but if there's anyone out there who's willing it would be truly appreciated! Im not asking for much, just a large pizza or maybe 2 mediums? Any questions, just ask! Thanks.
0	Yesterday I took an overnight bus ride to visit a friend before classes started, but since I'm so smart I decided to come over right after paying all my bills, thus leaving me in this spot.  Would any kind guys help me invite my friend to dinner?  Thanks!
1	I like to make 8 bit drawings as a hobby, and I figured why not! Here's an example of my work. http://imgur.com/YHSWb
0	24, San Francisco. I've been working at my new job for a few months, and it's been up and down for some time. This last paycheck, I had to buy a bunch of furniture for my new apartment, and had scheduled my bills and payments particularly close together, knowing I'd be cutting it close to my next paycheck.  Come tuesday, my debit card was declined for a payment that I knew was coming. I went to check my account and it turns out my gym membership had not been paid, draining my bank account to about 20 dollars.  Adding insult to injury I got sick on thursday, and half of my stuff is at my new apartment.  So here I am sitting alone in a half empty apartment with  no money, sick, broke, and waiting till the 30th to get back on my feet. Any help between now and then would be awesome, and I promise to pay back the ROAP by matching the help given to me.  PM me for details, I have my verification number ready.
0	My good friend lives in Norcal and she and her husband have been out of work for a long time. They have a little girl, and won't take any more help from me because they feel indebted and quite frankly I'm not in a financial position to be able to at the moment. I think if a magical pizza appeared at their door, it would make their night/week! 
0	There are 2 families on my block that each have a young boy. The family to my front is leaving to return home tomorrow (self deportation after a traffic stop). I've had a blast the last 2 years watching these kids grow up and play together and feel like shit that they are likely never going to see each other again. They are 5 or 6 I'm guessing.  Will someone please get these kids a last meal to share? I know illegal immigration is a Huge issue in the US, but fuck man, we're talking about children, and the kid leaving has never been out of Florida, let alone been to Mexico.  Thanks.   Eta: In Florida and we have Pizza Hut, Dominos, and Papa John's in the area.
1	She insists on cooking for our family every night because she thinks it's her job. She's been working a lot of overtime though lately and I just wish I could surprise her and our family with a pizza to start off her well deserved week end.  Found a deal at pizzahut for a 5.55 one topping large, and tried to round up change, but fell well short.
1	This is the state of my refrigerator: [Linky](http://i.imgur.com/JRvYJ5s.jpg)  I'll do my best to make someone else's week when I'm in a better state.  RAoP pls.  Edit(!!):  Thanks so much to /u/Felipe_O !!  I won't starve this week after all!!  Request fulfilled!!
1	EDIT- Fulfilled! Awesomely!  I'm a poor about-to-be-a-premed-student-starting-tomorrow. This is terrifying. Pizza (and maybe a salad, so I don't feel godawful fat. Just a pizza is dandy too) would help calm my nerves. Alas, I have no spare money. So, I am proposing a magnificent trade- I will finish the scarf that I just learned to crochet on (which will be finished in three or four more days), and a drawing of a narwhal, for pizza. Or a penguin, or an abrictosaurus, should you want the picture sent off NOW, because I already have drawings of those. Both are pretty awesome.  [Half-finished scarf](http://i.imgur.com/c1Gax.jpg) (I'm gonna finish the scarf in a lobelia blue, then black, and then maybe repeat a color or two to get it up to 5 feet long. Right now it's just about exactly two feet. Full disclosure, I did learn to crochet right before I started it, so the beginning isn't great. If you're willing to wait a week or two, I can make a new one from scratch that will all be nice. In that case, your options for colors are hunter green, pale blue-gray, a deep slightly reddish purple, lobelia blue, silver gray, and black. I can do stripes, and will do zig-zags but they aren't perfect. Stripes are way better. Anyway. Those are your options. I could totally do a bitchin' Slytherin-esque scarf (no coat of arms), or a black/silver/gray one, or... your options are endless)  [Penguin](http://i.imgur.com/hGWpS.jpg)  [Abrictosaurus](http://i.imgur.com/PDy9R.jpg)
1	I'm not going to do the whole sob story, I'm just gonna say: 21, female, rather strapped for cash at the moment. I'm alone for Christmas because I'm stuck in town working and all my friends are going and visiting their families like most average people. My next decent paycheck isn't until January 10th (I do have a very small one coming in on Friday, but because one of my two jobs isn't active during the winter break, said check will be very small and immediately eaten by groceries). I'm not out of food yet and can probably make it until then. I'm just kind of lonely and really want a pizza.  I'm prepared to do that verification thingy mentioned in the sidebar. I am also prepared to make you a really bad drawing in MS Paint, because I'm bored and don't have that much to do.  Also, Merry slightly-early Christmas!
0	She is hungry and I have pretty much run out of decent food to eat in the house.  I don't want her to suffer from another night of ramen and water, can anyone please help me out?    *EDIT*  I am in the Wisconsin area, if it matters.
0	Family is almost homeless but broke.  I am asking for some help please for food tonight 
0	So, on my way to visit my parents I got a phone call. My mom clearly having difficulty speaking finally she let out, "ginger died."  Ginger was a 1.5 year old golden doodle. The little sister to our older dog dusty. She was a beautiful loyal curly haired monster who did not deserve to die.  I'm now sitting home alone because my fiancÃ© is at work in the navy, looking at gingers pictures, just sad.   I don't feel like cooking.  I would greatly appreciate a pizza.  Thank you.
0	I don't know how to cook, and I moved into my apartment at college recently. Someone halp me? I liek pizza. Halp me get the pizzas.
0	I've been a long time lurker and did not want to post from my main username. Things have really hit the fan in more ways than one. My employer told me on Monday that this would be the last week the store would be operating. Even though this short notice is appreciated (I honestly thought I would show up for work one day and see a for sale sign on the building), she shorted my last two checks and has not corrected that yet. I'm not expecting my last check to include what she still owes me. I've done my best to juggle my bills and I had a real hard decision to make - Keep the lights on or buy groceries. I ended up paying the power and buying a case of ramen. After eating this for a few days, my stomach is literally screaming for anything else.   I'm willing to provide a copy of my bills, my last checks (and what it SHOULD have been) as well as anything else that may be needed for verification. I am humbly requesting a pizza, please. I hope that someone out there can hook me up. Thank you for reading.
1	A friend at work just told me about this site because she knows the situation I am in. I am a hard working mother of 4 who struggles from paycheck to paycheck. I get paid every two weeks and this week is a non pay week. I am flat broke and need help feeding my children.... my husband and i both will do without as long as my children can eat. I never miss a day at work but it never seems to be enough. My husband has been laid off and I am doing the best i can as a mother and wife to make it work. Any assistance at all will be more than appreciated.
0	Hey reddit, this has basically been the worst week of my life. My car window was broken, I'm looking at being evicted from my gf's parents house, making us both homeless, and my snake that I've had since birth just got eaten by a cat. We're not allowed to eat the food in the kitchen an I can't afford any food. Help?
0	Forgot to put in the Title, Manchester UK here, sorry.  Here's a link to a reddit post I made the other day, people in the thread said I should try here If I need help www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/18bit1/fiancee_of_2_years_just_left_me_when_i_was_out/  EDIT: I'll pay it forward when I can, big time believer of Today you, Tomorrow me

0	My Girlfriend's friends are jerks, and I would like to get her a pizza, but I am a broke-ass scrub... or something else funny. Don't tell her. It's a surprise.
0	I figure, what better subreddit to show my family than the awesomeness of r/random_acts_of_pizza ? I'll draw something if necessary, write you a "thanks for the pizza" song, whatever! Show some love?
0	Last Tuesday my friend of 6 years shot himself in the head and killed 3 other random people.  It's been a rough 2 weeks thinking about the whole thing. I haven't ate much and can barely get up in the morning to go to work.  
1	Im a single parent and I recently had an unexpected medical expense which took all of my money until this payday on friday. My son and I have been living off Ramen but i currently ran out I just need a quick break if anyone can help it will be greatly appreciated. Im a paramedic I try to make a difference I just need help right now, thank you.
1	So, I mismanaged my money, broke until Friday.  I'd love a pizza for myself, my fiancee and my roommate.  I will gladly verify any and all info.  I also did receive from an awesome guy a couple of months ago.  Just want to be up front.  Thanks for reading!
0	I'm about to leave my newlywed wife for 3 weeks to go train in the desert and would love to share a pizza and watch a movie with her the night before I have to leave!
0	Here are some cat pics so you guys know we're legit: http://i.imgur.com/kDsUP.jpg http://i.imgur.com/Lnedu.jpg  We really are hungry but we have a big, expensive day with the kitty tomorrow at the vet and we have to save for that.   Thanks for looking and hope everyone has a great night!
0	I limit myself to buying grocery store food and packing lunch because I can't afford eating out at work, but today it seems I'm going to be unexpectedly stuck here for another two hours or so and I didn't plan and bring dinner. The tupperware full of pasta I brought for lunch is long gone and my tummy is rumbling. Anyone willing to help me out with something to tide me over?  I'd be happy to share with the other research assistants who are stuck here, too. They look a little worn and would love the surprise, I'm sure.  Thanks for the consideration.
0	My suite-mates and I have all had terribly difficult weeks. We have all had programs, papers, and tests and I myself have two horrendous mathematics exams tomorrow. If anyone wanted to help out a few stressed out college students it would be very appreciated! I have been lurking and this subreddit seems to have a wonderful community!  Edit: Whoops, I need to proofread
0	I'm sure this sub-reddit gets this kind of story a lot, but I'm a university student with about forty dollars to my name until Christmas studying for finals season that starts on Saturday.   I've also been looking for a job for the last month and a half to no avail, a pizza would really brighten my mood right now.   Thanks for hearing me out. 
0	I've been having one heck of a time this month. First I came down with a really bad bug and missed work (Full-time student so I only work a couple nights a week) Then my water pump started leaking on my car. I spent every penny to my name on a replacement and managed to put the car back together without any left over bolts. Then last monday the car decided that I did not need a transmission that works. So I'm stranded on foot waiting for income taxes to come in so I can fix/replace the car.   I'm buried in homework at the moment and sitting here trying to finish a project thats worth half of my grade. A hot pizza would make the night much more enjoyable.   Thanks in advance 
0	Good evening folks! We sure would love some pizza right about now, but we're too poor to feed our dog anything but carrots, let alone spare some change for a tasty slice of some pizza pie! How 'bout it? There's 3 of us and we like pineapple
0	My overdraft is dry. I don't have a bank account. Just a crappy pre-pay debit card. I don't have any friends social. I have anxiety. But I went to an social event, today. :) If no one can offer me pizza, how can I borrow a bit of money for an pizza meal deal?
1	Im a student staying at home most of the time with a sick father. Is anyone able to buy us a pizza for tonight? Would really lighten up the mood around here!!!  cheers  edit: someone was already supposed to buy me one today but had problems from Europe and no longer could today. Would appreciate it if anyone could help me out.
0	Not sure what else to say, this is my first time posting here, I am just hungry and can't afford much. A pizza right now would be greatly appreciated. Haven't eaten today and I'm super hungry.
0	Hello, long-time lurker here.  I have been eating things out of cans for about the past week and some meaty, cheesy, hot pizza would be amazing.  I will have money by next Wednesday so that I can get some non-canned food, but for now, I'm pretty hungry.  It's finals/report/project season and I'm super stressed out.      More background info: college student in California, third year of my undergrad, broke until next week, etc.    I promise to put up pics once I receive my delicious circle of food.  Also, an e-gift card is preferred because I am about to head to school and I am not sure when I'll actually order the pizza.  PM me and I'll give you my email.  We have Domino's and Pizza Hut around where I am.    Once again, thanks so much!  (God) Bless you!
0	After almost a year of unemployment I finally got a job today! I haven't started yet so I'm still broke. My girlfriend spent the last of her money on beer last night so we could celebrate, so now I'm severely hungover and in dire need of pizza. Thanks!
1	I'm really enjoying this reddit.  Currently I am fighting off a virus and would love a pizza today as I haven't been able to keep anything down recently and pizza is all I feel like I can stomach at the moment.  More than willing to pay this forward once my tax return comes in as well as making a big thank you post. :)  ** Thanks odot522 for the pizza!
0	Working as much as I can but struggling. All our money is going to try to catch up on house payments. In debt and worried. Some pizza would be great. Thanks everyone for your time and attention. Located in NY.
1	I just moved into a new house this week. And need alittle help until I get paid. My bank accounts drained. And I'm so hungry. And so tired of ramen. 
0	I was really hoping to not have to do this... but I lost the work study job I've had for a year just a week after coming back to school about a month ago, and haven't found one to replace it yet. So I have no money, and on top of that, used my last meal swipe for the week last night at the cafeteria. I don't get to use next week's swipes until Monday, and I currently don't have any other source for food. A gift card for just one pizza would get me through the rest of the weekend, and once I find another job, I'll pay it forward to someone else in need. Really appreciate any help. Thank you!
0	So my story... I'm a university student, busy doing homework, lectures and reddit.  I had to cut my work hours down to the times I was available due to school and I've been getting an average of 4 hours a week... ($10.25/hr).  I've been having problems with having enough money to even bring a lunch at school and I've been pretty much free-loading off of my buddy.  I'm just looking for some nice person to help me out so I can treat him back for all the times he's bought me food.  Thank you for taking the time to read my story.  EDIT: I forgot to mention location: Carleton University, Ottawa, Canada.  Thanks again to anyone who might consider. :)  
0	no story straight to the point just had my last day of school and want to celebrate with pizza please! in the UK â¥
0	not working this week due to studies. I just want some tasty pie  
0	My son is having some friends over because he just got out of the hospital! He had to have surgery on his arm after a fall and now he is doing better, although depressed because he has to wear a cast for the rest of the summer. He is having a party to celebrate, but me and my husband don't have much money because we had to spend a lot for the surgery. (thank you obama). If someone could please send us an egift card that could feed 7 kids and 4 adults we would be very appreciative. Thank you all for what you do on this site and god bless. I know my son will be so happy for this.
1	This is just a shot in the dark, but does anyone want to buy my husband and I some pizza for our wedding anniversary? 
0	I live in philly and a nice egift card would me nice for my family. We don't have a lot of food either. So, is there anyone willing to get a papa johns egift card. It's closer to me. 
0	I'm embarrassed to ask because I'm always a giver, but I would love to receive a large meat lovers deep dish pizza from Cottage Inn with mushrooms and onions on the whole thing and jalapeno on half.   My boyfriend and I have been craving pizza the entire week, and he's coming over tonight but I can't afford to buy one. I don't have any meal plans left for the semester (ends Monday the 19th), and I can basically only feed him a sandwich or Cheerios. It would be awesome if someone could help out. I just spent all of my money on my monthly bills and books for next semester. Please and thank you!  EDIT: I can verify that I'm human or whatever. I will also try to do a random act of kindness for someone this weekend.
0	First person to offer us a pizza gets a custom made duct tape wallet made by us! :)
0	Long time lurker here... As the title says, I've been living off of the dollar menu for the past two weeks on change I've saved up. I ran out of change yesterday, and I don't get paid until Tuesday. The only thing I want is at least one decent meal until then.  Anyone who helps me out will get a pizza when I get my check and one internet hug :D
0	I have been sick since Tuesday and my fiance has been taking care of our son Tony(6) and baby girl (3 months). He has been taking care of their every need and making sure I got rest so I could get better. Our son was a big help also. When dad was making bottles, Tony would keep baby entertained. He helped dad whenever asked. I really appreciate my fiance and all he did this week to make sure everything was taken care of. I am feeling better, just have a sore throat and a slight headache. I haven't been able to cook for them and I know they would really love a pizza!   
0	http://imgur.com/NnPh876.png  Hey RAOP, we all know how tough of an economy it is. I didn't expect to have to ask strangers for assistance, but even my mother had fallen in hard times. I recently obligated my contract with Army and am having a hard time reintegration. I haven't had a lot of luck and a pizza would really help. I need a haircut too, but I think that might be a different subreddit. I hope to be able to do the same for someone else in the future.   Eternally thankful, .39Â¢.
0	Any help will do! Thanks!
0	give a pizza to a deserving person that went thru the hurricane, i would myself but im broke myself and good thoughts are not enough to feed people, PLEASE help those who have nothing 
0	just moved to columbia, sc...I start my job on next Monday and am a little tight on cash to say the least with rent due this week. Would appreciate a random act of pizza (kindness) to help out one night. 23 years old and just starting out! Thank you for reading!
1	**First let me say that I will provide any reasonable verification as to the validity of what I am going to say. Just message me. I am very sorry for the pity parade, honestly, however my embarrassment is over weighed by my concerned for my friend and her family. If you have any advice that I can forward to her please private message me. Thank you.**  So here is the situation: I am requesting pizzafication on behalf of a friend of mine who does not Reddit. She is a young mother, married, and with two children (3 and 1). She recently moved to Glendale, AZ from Florida. She was supposed to be able to stay with an In-Law. That plan fell through due to circumstances outside of her control and she has to vacate her current residence this Friday. She has one other family member in the city that she will be moving in with. She has a job lined up with a call center but doesn't start for 2 months (she has to wait for the next training classes to start).   **So yes, long term, she will be OK.**  The problem, is that DES hasn't approved her application yet (she has not been in the state long) and she and her husband are skipping eating meals days at a time. Thankfully she is still managing for her children, at the expense of her and her husband eating. I am just looking for a meal to help her get to next week, where I am pretty sure she will be OK (and I will be able to lend further aid at that point if she isn't). 
0	We're a family of 6 and we're completely broke. Money wise and food wise. We wanted a pizza for dinner tonight, but like I said, we're broke. Can you help us out? We appreciate it!
1	My rent check, student loan payment, &amp; car payment all went through on the same day. Now I'm left with a -$103 account balance and the only thing to eat in my house is apples.  If anyone could be so kind as to pizza me, I would be much obliged. I will have access to funds come Monday, so I'll be able to survive until my paycheck on Friday.  Also, I promise I will pay it forward. When I get paid on Friday, I solomly swear that the first thing I'll do is pizza someone else in need.  Thank you!  **[edit] I've already been pizza'd by the gracious FrankReynolds. Just wanted to update this post, as my "got pizza'd" tag has yet to be applied.**
0	Hey y'all. Just showed back up to campus last night, and completely forgot that the food court closes early on Friday nights. No real money to speak of until financial aid kicks in, and I could use food that isn't a vending machine bag of chips. Shoot, once I start getting my housing allowance I'll even return the favor.   TL;DR:  I'm an idiotic sophomore sometimes.

Yay!  http://occupycleveland.com/2011/10/26/occupycleveland-wins-injunction-in-federal-court-against-city-will-begin-247-occupation-immediately/  I'm humbly requesting that maybe some folks could pitch in for pizza. We're at the Tom Johnson Park in Public Square, downtown Cleveland. We LOVE pizza. Well, really, we love any hot food, but pizza tops it all. :) Most of all, we love support! Thank you, reddit.  By the way, my name is Rachel. I am not currently downtown, but I can give any proof needed (aside from a phone call, because I don't have a phone) to show that I'm real. :) I'll be heading downtown sometime soon for our daily General Assembly.
0	at 12 am EST it will be my Bday and after a rough year all my GF and I would like is a pizza delivered. anything goes on the pizza but we are normally vegetarians. 
0	Hi reddit. I'm a theatre major in Columbus and I'm wondering if someone could buy me a pizza. I've been working on a lot of projects and wrapping up the last week of summer classes and a greasy pizza is just the thing to kick start my night of work. To aid in my plea, I propose a trade! Here is a poem I have written for you, redditors of /r/Random_Acts_of_Pizza! Enjoy!  -ODE TO PIZZA-  Oh sauce, saucey sauce,  Tasting you makes me feel boss,  Spread you thick, long and wide,  Dick jokes are poem cyanide,  So let's talk pizza, with all that cheese,  Bread, butter. *Greeeaaaaassseeeeeeee*  On the rack, on the tray,  Pizza on pizza? So **deliciously** gay.  Mushrooms, peppers, onions and chives,  Get the fuck out, MEAT SAVES LIVES!  That was a pretty bad rhyme so I'll make it up to ya,  By ending this poem with an evil doll **"HOO-HA!"**  Zombies ate my neighbors y'aaaaalllll
0	My bad have no money to order even a pizza.
0	I'm a student who's exhausted my semester fund, and my boyfriend's paycheck is lost somewhere in the mail. I'm hoping that someone could help us out tonight, as we've exhausted the pasta reserves in the pantry. Thanks guys.
0	I've been friends with Sam for about 5 years now. We run together, we game together, I wingman for him every week, but it's his 22nd birthday tomorrow and I have absolutely nothing to give him. I'm out of dinero, got rice and oatmeal in the cupboard. Mother Hubbard up in here. I'd love some help!
1	OP will deliver.
0	I never thought I would end up here, pleading my case for a pie on Reddit. But alas, I must succumb to the forces of hunger and humbly extend a request to the hearts behind the 'Alien'... Here I sit in my girlfriends apartment alone, as she is away visiting Montreal, without a dime to my name nor a can in any cupboard. I am broke until pay-day which is three days away, and I have been making due in the meantime. If anyone is kind enough to buy me a pizza, I would be certain to reciprocate and pay it forward once I get my pay cheque. Edit: I am located in Toronto
0	Getting hungry and mom forgot to leave me money when she went to work, anyone feeling kind or random?
1	The three of us are here at work at the campus computer repair desk. It's the end of the semester and we're all kind of hurting on cash, and it would be awesome to get a little pizza to share and make sure we aren't wasting an hour of $8/hour pay.  R_A_O_P is awesome, and we'd really appreciate it. I really hate asking for stuff like this, but pizza sounds delicious right now.  Thanks for considering us.  EDIT!!: http://imgur.com/YPcbf
1	Hey, our flats electricity bill came through the other day, so we're all pretty skint and hungry right now. Can't think of anything we could give anyone really. We CAN, however, offer love and the promise of a future pizza to a further lost soul on the road to happiness.   [Feel the love :)](http://imgur.com/rXdNg)  And we're in the uk!  Thanks!  EDIT We'll recreate your gaming scenes! [To start your ideas off!](http://i.imgur.com/NX3GI.jpg)  Edit edit: **thanks deyona :)**
1	After not having a job for 3 months finally got a new one "Junior Role Out Engineer" for the Ministry of Justice, Into my 2nd week now, but do not get paid until 30th September.  Have no spare money at the moment to treat myself, get paid at the end of the month, Pizza would be awesome.
1	Hey there RAOP, I'm currently at home with my brother and we are really hungry. My mom has little to no money and won't be able to go food shopping for another 2 days. I was wondering if any of you would be kind enough to supply us with a pizza for tonight :] I've only lurked in here, so I don't really know if it's a crazy thing to request pizza hut. Thanks &lt;3  Edit: Thanks to Yarrg for hooking us up! Greatly appreciated!
0	I'm broke till friday and shes a full-time student. I can pay it forward on friday. I also have a few coupons for papa johns so im not looking for much just to get by. 
0	Hey recently moved downtown, but still working in sandy springs so I am spending all of my money on gas.  I don't get paid until wednesday and would love some pizza.  I will definitely pass on the love once I get my check!
1	Hello /RAOP! I've been a Redditor for quite some time now, and have seen the amazing generosity that this forum can produce. (EDIT: This is not my main account. I can verify through PMs my other account.)  I've got two younger sisters, a mother going to school full time for her masters (almost there!), and a girlfriend. We all live under the same roof, and here lately, things have been a bit rough. We haven't been grocery shopping in about a month or so, and have no money do to so at the moment. We're holding out for our grants (we all go to school), but unfortunately those will not arrive for another couple of weeks.   I beseech you RAOP, can you make our entire month? We would love to sit around the table and share a meal, it's been too long.  Thank you always for your generosity.  SIDENOTE - I can verify using the tool listed in the sidebar, as well as deliver pictures of our incredibly empty fridge/freezer and pantry. 
1	In a nutshell, 2 months ago I sold my car to cycle to work and yesterday night the rear derailleur of my Trek Madone sheared off and I crashed into a bus shelter full of kids (no kids were hurt, but they laughed).   I have to spend my last Â£60 on repairs whilst nursing a bruised ego.  I only have freezer food until Friday and some pizza would go a long way to making me feel better.    I will forward or pay back as soon as I get paid this Friday, promise.  Thanks for reading.  EDIT: image of the derailleur http://i.imgur.com/zxM9oXl.jpg 
0	Today has been so bad today. On my way to work my battery light came on.. later on I found out my alternator went bad. Then on my way home my car died on the side of the road and I had to use the last bit of money to tow it home. I dont know yet how Im gonna get to work tomorrow. A pizza would really make this day better for me if anyone out there can help at all... I'll give you a kiss on the cheek :)
0	I've never done this, but I lost my job around February, right when I had to move to a more expensive place to live. I had to spend all of the money I had left on rent and I have been living on beans and rice for the last week and a pizza sounds really awesome! I'm getting ready for finals and almost moving home to a job. I will repay my pizza as soon as I get more money!
0	If someone wouldn't mind helping us out, we would be very grateful. If not, we understand. Thanks.
0	I feel weird asking, but my family would really enjoy a pizza. My parents lost their jobs after the devastating tornado here in Joplin. We currently have other family members living with us that lost everything. We have 12 people living here right now and were living off can goods and pasta or whatever is given to us. We would grately appriciate a special gift like this..  &lt;3 God bless Joplin &lt;3 
0	I have (college) finals this weekend and I am going to be studying all night tonight and tomorrow. My friends and I could use some pizza!
0	Hope I get a response!
0	My girlfriend usually stays home during the semester because it's closer to the college.  Most of the time she otherwise lives with me.  We are both in our mid-twenties. This evening, she was home, and her mom decides to do yet another psycho-parent sniff test disguised as a hug.  Convinced she smells "cigarettes or pot" (and obviously doesn't know the difference) on her adult daughter, she goes on a baseless accusatory my-house-my-rules rager.  She lives an hour away but decided she'd just rather live with me than suffer through that again.  We're saving up to move away to Colorado, and we'd really love to just chill out and eat some pizza tonight.  Domino's is the only thing around; if anyone wants to help, we would definitely pay it forward in the future.  I'd love to be able to surprise her with not having to cook dinner when she gets here.  Thank you.
0	hello, my husband has become unemployed and i really could use a pizza to cheer me and my kids up. we are living in vancouver, and anything would really help. thank you!!!
0	I am sitting here alone and bored this evening. Would be nice to spend it with a pizza. Just imagine the adventures the pizza and I  could go on, and once the adventuring is over the pizza will be devoured. But do not fret as the deed will be repaid to another poor pizza less soul, so they can also enjoy the greatness of the pizza.
0	I have posted my story before (ironically in a thread kind of about pizza) here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/jkqak/dominos_pizza_deliveryman_saves_dude_from_psycho/c2d11rd?context=3  I don't begin to receive food aid until next month and I'm trying to make it until then.  If any kind soul would like to send me a pizza, I could really use one.  I will provide verification upon request.
1	Hi guys, My name is Lani, I'm a teenage girl from LA. I currently go to summer school during the day but because of my families income, it's hard to pay for my school lunch everyday, leaving me hungry. I am fortunate to eat after school and sometimes before but other than that, I have no lunch. If anyone could provide a pizza for one day, I would truly be grateful. Thank you.
0	This isn't for me but a friend and his family. He's a disabled war vet that worked with me until his injuries made it impossible to function. His wife works as a barista and they have a preschooler. They're flat broke while the VA gets their thumbs out and gets him some medical help, and they need food. I'm going to bring them some groceries but tonight they're going hungry. Any help is appreciated.  Edit: We're in middle TN, if it helps.
0	Hungry and would love some food but we're all broke and still working on homework. Any love for some Seattle students?
0	My life isn't particularly terrible or anything, but I'm spending from now until tuesday buried in books and essays preparing for next weeks finals, and that's just no fun. I have $5 left for the semester, but it's gonna need to be spent on 7/11 coffee to get me through. I'd love a pizza for morale and just to be done with my stockpile of microwave bagel bites (even though they were amazing about 15 boxes ago.)  I'm a big fan of Dominos, but obviously, anything would be more than appreciated.  Also, when school's out and I'm back home, it will be easier to come by money and I would love to return the favor.  Thanks in advance, and hell thanks for anyone who has given on this subreddit, just for being a kickass person.
1	I recently moved out to AZ from LV and well... my story consists of heartbreak, pawning of items, and basically picking myself up from the ground.  I'll be more than glad to share my story, but honestly I could use a pizza. I've got no money for dinner and i've been making due with some ramen but yeah...It'd be nice to have a pizza.  I'm usually on the other end of this but this time I could really use the help.
1	I'm helping her pack up and we would love some delicious pizza. She just quit her job to go follow her SO across the state, I'm broke and waiting on my financial aid check to miraculously appear soon, helping her out instead of studying.  We would appreciate it and will pass it on when things brighten up financially!
1	Recently I have been given the opportunity to move schools, where I would be away from the people who would 'use' me (bully doesn't sound a justified word somehow) however the catch is that I would know absolutely nobody there, I will be practicing for my A-levels later this year and I feel a lot of pressure on me by my family and peers. So my favorite foods is Italian (Pasta, Gnocchi, Pizza ect.) and it would be of a great service if I could get some comfort food or even some advice to help me be calm, I really don't know whether this decision will be good for me or not. Please help!
0	[On behalf of my girlfriend] On the bus to the airport, for some reason my card (which has money on it) has been declined.   I'm with my brother and he has no card or money. Haven't eaten anything at all today (had to leave for the airport very early).  When I get to Germany to (meeting my dad for the holidays), we're supposed to get the train to his house.. no money for that either lol, so basically today is probably going to suck. [UK]  (I'm writing on behalf of her as she is on the bus and has no internet and will have no internet in the airport if she has no money)  
0	Broke college senior trying to get through finals week studying and would love a pizza pick me up. Broke right now and tired of eating ramen and old leftover chinese take out. 
1	Passing of my grandfather. 750 miles driven yesterday. 5 round trips to new york in 3 days from new haven, along with a rushed flight back from europe. Work... Lots of work... Exhaustion... 3 hours of sleep a night at most.. Anyways. Pizza is nice. Writing that out was pretty nice too. Finally have nothing to do. Anyways. If you are even reading this you are probably a pretty great person, so thanks.
1	I gotta say, I haven't had a pizza in a while, it just isn't in the budget. I'm starving and would &lt;3 you forever if you bought me and my gf a pie :)
0	From March 30th to April 1st, all of my nearby family (nuclear and extended), will be having glorious fun times at the beach during Spring Break, but I CAN'T go because MY Spring Break was 2 weeks ago because I'm in college and they have to be all DIFFERENT and SPECIAL. When this happened last year, I ate nothing but cottage cheese from the back of the fridge seasoned with tears of loneliness(hyperbole for comedic affect) because I'm shit at cooking dinner(and lazy).  BUT...  What if there was a glorious community of internet Supermen, capable of setting me up with some sort of electronic code, equivalent to some amount of money, with which I could order GLORIOUS CIRCLES OF CHEESE AND BREAD, preferably from Papa Johns, and HAVE THEM DELIVERED TO MY DOOR BY WHITE STALLIONS THAT SHIT SPARKLES?  Anyone feeling generous? Sparkle-shitting stallions are optional, if that would help.
1	here is picture i took today with my babies: http://i.imgur.com/IyTUk.png   as you can see no food on table have  not eaten in 2 days. would love some hot pizza. dont worry where i live i dont want to mention that. just send cash.
0	We just got our first place and are a wee bit low on funds and would love to get some pizza tonight :) 
1	I'm currently in my second year of a Computer Science degree at the University of Maryland.  I've been living on loans and a part-time job for the summer, but due to a paperwork screw-up I'm currently between loans.  On top of THAT I had to sink 500 bucks into my beater car to replace the brake pads.  I'm down to about 100 dollars on my credit limit and 30 bucks in my debit account - just crossing my fingers each day that I hear back from the financial aid office.  I'm so sick of ramen day in and day out, and I spend minutes at a time fantisizing about a fresh, hot pizza.  It would make me feel so much better.
1	I would be so eternally grateful if someone would like to order me a pizza! I can provide verification--I am flat ass broke until Friday. Been on a ramen diet for a few days now. On Friday, regardless of whether I get a pizza tonight or not, I will purchase two pizzas for two different people. 
0	This is pretty embarrassing, but yes I broke my bed. I'm going to be sleeping on my mattress for a while and I have no idea as to when I can replace my bed. I also had to pay off an old medical bill, which left me with .22 cents in the bank. This is by far the most depressing day I've had in a very long time. I'm willing to show my bank balance and a copy of my receipt from the hospital. Please help turn my frown upside down.  I'm in Georgia.
0	Its been a rough week i've been having some family problems and work problems and shits and today is just not going right I know i've asked and received before but hopefully someone can take pity and hook me up 
0	me and my best friend are stuck at her brothers house while they are on vacation. We are going to be up all night studying for our finals for our summer classes. A pizza would be a great treat. 
0	Hello I just read this article:  http://abcnews.go.com/US/random-acts-pizza-donate/story?id=13950694  And it is amazing that something like this actually exists over the internet, I am here for assistance , because sad to say I am hungry and have been for the past 2 days and my check for the week has already been spent on paying the rent and fixing my car brakes.  If anyone with a kind heart can help me, I promise to return next week and give pizzas to those in need thank you
0	cheese would be great.
0	kinda broke until next paycheck next friday and im sorta outta food at my place  :/ anything can help thanks :)
0	Hey, I was wondering if there was anyway that someone could PM me or write on this post in response to get me a free pizza from Dominoes or something. I am starving and a college student please help!
0	So my husband and i are so far into the red in our bank account its ridiculous from helping our friends who decided to visit and their card stopped working. Now its Monday after noon and I'm working on my novel craving a pizza. Anyone feel like helping? We'll pay it forward and confirm what ever you want from us.
0	Northern chicago area.
0	Hey.. Just lost my job due to the owners going bankrupt. Not only that but we're not receiving our last paychecks as far as I know. I just spent 1.5 weeks working for money I may not receive.   Five minutes ago I just paid my bills.. I now have $1.04 to my name now. If someone would care to simply be awesome I'd love to eat today. 
0	In the middle of packing to move, and I just realized I haven't eatten. I'm very strapped for cash right now because of my having to move. I would love to have a small pizza, pizzone, or anything really so I can get back to work without having to spend time unpacking dishes to cook. Murfreesboro,Tn.
0	Not exactly urgent, but my oven is currently broken and I don't have anything to eat that I do not have to cook somehow. Pizza sounds great tonight, but my bank account is drained (damn cell phone bills!). I will pay it forward at some point if someone buys. There are others more needy than I am though so if you feel someone else needs it more (i.e. families), please do it for them instead. Just thought I'd post this on here in case anyone was feeling generous.
0	My boyfriend is a SUPER pessimist, and I told him about the pizza exchange. He said there was no way anyone on the internet would just give someone else a pizza, so I'm hoping to prove him wrong!
0	Ill take only Domino's delivers though. Pwease :D
1	My close uncle is in the hospital. I don't know the full details but he more or less lost his mind. For the past 3 weeks he has been making up strange stories that got more and more strange and the other day it got very bad and he passed out and has been in the hospital since. Tomorrow me and my fiancee are driving 220 miles to go visit him and the rest of my family and I am using the last of my money to do so. I am out of a job and so is she and we would both love to be able to just relax tonight with a nice pizza to help cheer us up. I promise to pay it forward as soon as I get a job or some extra money.  EDIT: Forgot to include our location. We live in Plymouth, Indiana.
1	Any size pizza will do, considering that I'm the only person home and I have no car or real amount of money at the moment. All meats are good, no veggies.   Edit: meant real amount of money, not pizza.
0	Would love some pizza to keep me going and to hold me over for the rest of the night. 
0	Freaking on my way home my tire pressure light came on and pulled into my dealer. Figuring that they just needed to put some air in a tire was expecting to be in and out. Two hours later i have to drop over $200 that wiped out my bank account, and now I'm home with an empty fridge and hungry. Any help would be awesome : ) 
0	Was heading to work today when i was rear ended. Rear bumper got completely ripped off and the other driver fled the scene. Car luckily is drivable but needs some repairs[whole rear bumper :(]. Spent just about the rest of my income on ER surcharge but im free of injuries thankfully. Nerves a little rattled after all this and got the rest of the day to lay around and recover. Funds are on low until Friday and would really appreciate the help.   http://i.imgur.com/yrqlV.jpg  -- Holding it down in the ER. hah
0	Hi RAOP,  I am a comp sci student and I live in salt lake city.I have a lot of homework this friday night and no free time. a pizza would really make my day - I have nothing to eat at my apartment and little room in my budget for something as delicious as a pizza.   I can offer programming services to anybody who needs them in return! 
0	I've fallen on some really, really tough times.  Work has been cutting back hours consistently, my wife has had some medical problems we've been working through and trying to pay off some old school debts.  We've been essentially wiped out, and it's getting to the point where I don't know where our next meal is coming from.  The local church has been extremely helpful, but I'd love to be able to give them a break for a night or two, maybe with the generosity of someone on here.  I know it's a lot to ask, and I know there are dozens of people looking for the same thing, but I would be immensely and forever grateful if someone would be willing and able to help us out.   
0	I've had a lot happen in the last year but I'm always trying to be positive and keep my head from sinking. I rode my water bill too long this time around. Now just a few days before I could pay them it's been shut off, and they've made it clear they won't cut it back on without payment first. I live mostly off instant noodles and macaroni, now I can't even boil water for a cup of tea. Right now my sink is loaded with dirty dishes that'll probably be ruined by the time I can run the dishwasher. I don't get anymore cash until this weekend, so the water isn't coming back anytime soon. I'm not working at the moment and I don't have wheels anymore either. My bank account is literally drawn down to the 70 cent mark, even if I had transport I couldn't buy anything substantial.   When I asked a neighbor I get along with just to let me fill up a milk jug he told me no instantly. He acted like I was asking him at gun point. So he can borrow my edger, but me asking for a gallon of water is the line, apparently. I don't know what I'm going to do when I inevitably need to flush the toilet. I got a lot of time to come up with creative solutions but food isn't something I can come up with a fix for. I was going to live off spaghetti and macaroni until payday but now I'm stuck with no water to boil them in. I ate an uncooked ramen brick for a meal earlier, if I don't get some real food I think I'll go nuts. I can provide proof if someone needs it, I'll scan the note the left for me or whatever you guys wants. I'm being real here, I'm in a bad way and the end isn't in sight quite yet. Can anyone help me?
1	So after being a year and 4 months clean off of a serious opiate addiction, i started realizing alcohol was starting to take over my life.  checking myself into rehab on thursday and will be there for the next 60 days.  not trying to gain sympathy for that, as most will say that being in this position is my fault.  but nonetheless, i'm broke, and want to eat some pizza.  would love to return the favor when i get out.    i'm a 22 year old male in texas in case anyone wanted to know. thanks :)
0	I've known about this subreddit for about a week, but I've been kind of reluctant to request because I see people who have either had really good or really bad things happen to them, and I would feel bad if I got a pizza they didn't. I still don't have anything really good or really bad happening to me, I'd just like a pizza and can't afford one, as well as I've got a lot of school work to do this evening. I worked through lunch (I just forgot) and for dinner they only had chicken (I worked at a chicken factory, so it's kind of difficult for me to eat chicken and not feel at least a little queasy), I ate a couple bowls of cereal but I think I'm going to be up pretty late as I'm also studying for a polisci exam on Tuesday, and I am already getting the rumbles, if someone could help me out this evening, I would truly appreciate it and be more than willing to pay it forward.  Edit: The only place that delivers here (there is one other, but the owner verbally abused a good friend of mine while she was at work for not handing out flyers the day after he dropped them off at the office) actually closes at 11, but thank you for taking the time to read it, have a good day and  if you're looking for a sign to buy someone a pizza or you're just too embarrassed to request one, go for it, take part in this community!
1	TL;DR - My spouse and I are hurting too bad to walk for groceries and have run out of food.   I am mid 30's, hub is in his 40's.   We rely on one another to get things as a team, but the last two days, my knee has been "out" and his back has been "out" and our grocery trip relies on us walking a half mile to the local Walmart neighborhood grocery store, filling up backpacks and a large rolling suitcase, and walking home with them.    We have to do our month's shopping all at once because we are on the stamps and to break it up into smaller trips wouldn't allow the money to stretch.   We have an offer for a ride to the store tomorrow, but we've been eating once a day for a week and ran out of food yesterday.  Please pm me if you can help. Willing to answer any questions.  [Edit] Spelling
1	I've been extremely frustrated lately not having any luck finding a job, I'm sure a lot of you know the feeling.  Getting no responses whatsoever is so discouraging.  It would be so awesome to have something other than soup or ramen, but alas I have about 90 cents to my name.  If you aren't able to help me out, but know of any job opportunities within Phoenix, AZ, please let me know!
0	Looking for something delicious for dinner. Payday is Friday, trying to stay fed till then!!
0	 Stumbled across this subreddit and figured it was worth a shot. My cousin and I moved out on our own a few weeks ago and he is unemployed. I have been paying all bills/ buying all groceries and other expenses. We've been living very meager and haven't eaten out since we moved. We were talking the other day about how we would love a pizza. I anyone would kindly donate we would be very appreciative and would most certainly reciprocate in any way we can.
0	Recently moved to Montreal, start a new job Monday but until then I am absolutely broke.  Pizza would save my life.
0	Hey everyone...I would be so honored if someone got me a pizza! I'm having a rough time right now. I'm a pre-med student and have a part-time job, but it's only giving me about 4-8 hours a week. By the time I pay my bills (which is pretty hard to do hehe), I have no money left over for groceries. A free pizza would be a lifesaver! Thanks in advance.
0	Fever of 102 degrees and can barely leave my couch. :/ would love a pepporoni pizza.   P.S. I hate thin crust...  EDIT: Sorry noticed typo in title....
1	So, as the title says, I'm currently broke. Well, to be more exact, I have $2.07 in my bank account, so I guess I'm not out on my ass quite yet.  My boyfriend and I both are students and work part-time jobs, but unfortunately our jobs were both seasonal and now that the school year's pretty much over, so are our jobs. We're looking for work, but as many of you I'm sure know, that can be tough.  I'd really appreciate any generosity from you great folks. A pizza tonight would be really, really awesome. Thanks so much.
0	Title kinda says it all. I'm working over break so I don't get to go home until tomorrow night. I work at a restaurant and while everyone else is home for the holidays, my tips have sucked (talking like &lt;$10 a night). I'd for sure pay it forward as soon as I got the chance, I just don't want to spend what little rent money I have on food for the next 2 days. 
0	Willing to respond with creative photography of pizza.
0	Me and my roommates are broke as a joke, would love a pizza.  Currently trying to stop our hunger by smoking the last of the Shisha.
0	Started school and had to cut back my hours at work, so my paycheck has been a little lacking. Would really appreciate a pizza. 
0	Finished up my last big project in class today! Life is great and I'm stress free. Anyone want to help me celebrate with some pizza?
0	Long story short, today is my boyfriend's birthday and it has nooooot gone as planned at all.   It sucks :( I want to take him out for dinner to try to fix this, but can't afford it. Broke as hell and I don't get paid until the end of the month.  I live in Canada, is anyone willing/able to help me out? Something delicious from Pizza 73 or Panago would go miles towards helping me perk him up and put a smile on his face.  Edit: scratch this request, guys. We're passing out now.  Keep calm and pizza on!  
0	I hate banks, because of a glitch in the banks system my check n't be in til monday,"cross my fingers." the problem is that I have a wife and 3 kids who were counting on that check as well as myself. now, we are not only going to be late for rent, our electricity may get shut off as well as we are past due, we only have some ramen noodles and popcycles for dinner.we were counting on my check to get groceries, and as you can see, that is out of the picture. it doesn't help neither of us have fa,ily members here, so we can't even borrow. so if anyone out there can help, we would appriate it. I am not sure how this works, so I wil include my email as well, it is staglord01@yahoo.com. feel free to contact me, and my family would appreiate any help right now, it will be payed forward next week. thanx for listening.
0	I'm not really going to sugar coat it, I'm just having a large craving for pizza, but sadly, there's no one at my house to get any, and there's not much to eat that sounds good. I will pay it forward if someone helps!
0	I actually have money for the pizza but all I have is a 50 dollar bill, and the delivery boys don't accept anything larger than a 20 dollar bill.
0	Hey Guys,  My Parents have had a terrible week, and while I would normally buy them dinner at a time like this I'm between paycheques and out of cash.  This week my dad lost his job of 12 years, on top of that yesterday our family Dog passed away (14 years old, so not totally unexpected). They are just really in the "World against us" point of view. They could really use some love from the world at large, and that is where I was hoping ROAP might come in.  If you guys could find a way to send them some saucy cheesy goodness that would be amazing, and come next friday (Payday) I will be passing it on.  Thanks guys!
1	Howdy, I seem to be in a predicament. I have bronchitis,  and I can't get out of bed. I spent all my money getting antibiotics and an inhaler. All I really need is a pizza. I think I just coughed up a good piece of my lung. Oh well. But really, I'll love you forever. I believe in paying it forward, so I think I'm done rambling. 
0	Hey, poor university student here...I have no food till friday until my paycheck comes in. If anyone could get me a pizza it would be much appreciated!
0	Hey guys, I just got a new job this last week so my first paycheck isnt coming for another 2. I'll have a bit of cash for groceries once I fix a friends PC but that won't be until Tuesday and I ran out of tuna and rice yesterday at lunch. If anyone can help that would be awesome.
0	I'm broke and hungry and im streaming movies for friends, the assholes wont even feed me :P will reddit?  on this site : https://www.thuisbezorgd.nl/en/checkout-order-chicken-house-shoarma  they got an english site, take paypal and creditcards
1	So, I got a letter  (shown  [here](http://i.imgur.com/Yxm0D.jpg), for proof and mirrored, due to crappy webcam,) that says i'm an illinois state scholar! Free pizza for being the top 10% of students in my state, and for not having any money buy a pizza myself?
0	I am a 2nd shift supervisor where i work, I had two staff members pull the no call no show. This put more strain on the other members of my staff, trying to show the 5 of them that showed up I appreciate them however low on funds... any help would be greatly appreciated. Will pay it forward for sure.
0	Just like the title says. Paycheck didn't come in because of bad weather and I'm hungry, pizza me tonight and you will be repaid! Scouts honor!  
0	I finally found a decent job with benefits! I haven't had pizza in sooo long and it would just be the icing on the cake for me.   I will gladly pay it forward when I get my first pay check :)
0	I'm out of food stamps till the 6th, and I've been eating fruits and vegetables salvaged from dumpsters behind high end grocery store in Berkley. While pizza probably isn't the healthiest source of it, the lack of protein I'm getting from my current diet is making me rather weak, and to be honest, I'm getting rather burnt out of potatoes, carrots, and apples. A pizza would be absolutely killer right now. Please help a girl out, I promise I'll return the favor to someone else in need once I'm less down on my luck.  Edit: A friend of mine just came over with a few groceries for me, so I no longer need a pizza, but if you're still willing to give me one, I'll happily take it.
0	I broke my leg a couple years ago and lost my job because of it.  I've, thus far, been unsuccessful in my search for employment.  Workers comp ran out in Februaury, and it's been very tight these last few months.  My wife works really hard as a teacher for troubled kids.  She loves pizza, but we just can't afford it right now, so does anyone want to help me treat a very special woman?
0	hey there RAoP,  i'm an undergraduate Computational Media major at Georgia Tech, which pretty much means i'm a Computer Science major except I specialize in things like film, user interfaces, video games, stuff like that. i'm directing a fifteen-minute horror movie for my english class, and i've been sick the past couple of days (which is a double bummer because we've had monday and tuesday off) so i'm in OVERDRIVE mode. i have all the work i can possibly do for tonight done and i'm just exhausted and still a little under the weather. i have also forgotten to eat today, and my meal plan is full for the week so i can't go to the dining halls :(  if there are unfulfilled [REQUEST]s from mothers with children or people who are literally starving please get me off the front page as fast as you possibly can, but if anyone can spare a pizza for a starving artist that would be awesome. i'll even put you in the credits of the movie under 'special thanks' if you want :p  i can provide a link to the course website as well as a picture of me outside the dorm as verification.  pizza or no pizza, have a great night, everyone!
1	Hello,  What would you like in exchange for a Pizza Hut gift code?   We'll take pictures of whatever you can think of, draw, sing, make fools of ourselves in whatever way makes you happy. We are super hungry! We have seven bucks but no gas, so we could walk to Pizza Hut and spend seven bucks on something, but I know it won't feed both of us. You wouldn't guess it by looking at us but we could eat a pizza a piece if some generous member ofr royalty had that kind of money to patronize us with.   This is barter town, and we are 100% willing to work!   Please take a chance and send us a PM, you won't regret it!  sorry this sounds so much like an advertisement, we are super hungry and the thought of pizza hut is making us a liiitle bit crazy
0	Yeah as the title says I'm in a pretty bad spot and on top of these things I'm hungry! I'll be sure to pay it forward once I'm in a better situation!!   and it looks like I posted this to the wrong subreddit, so now I'm reposting here :)  edit: Oh also, I'm near NYC 
1	EDIT! Thanks to jetboyterp! He provided us with some nice grub for the night. It amazes me to no end to see the kindness still left in some people, and pushes me forward to keep providing that same kindness to others whenever I am able. I'll follow up with some pictures of some pizza!  Hello fellow Redditors. I'm probably gonna rant and make a bigger deal of this than I should, and I'll try to keep it short and simple. But let me mention, I am NOT one to ask for assistance. But there comes times when we must swallow our pride.  I have a small family of three, just my daughter, my wife, and myself. I'm a mechanic by trade, and make an acceptable amount of money...normally. The last month has been very rough, with work being slow and hours being cut. We are in an apartment that costs us $325/wk, and that is killing us. We've had to cut off both phones, and recently our car took a turn for the worst and left us without transportation.  I've been able to keep food in the house, up until the last week or so. Mostly thanks to foodstamps, but those funds have run out. This last week I've had to pay back some small debts to my boss and father, and it's really hurt.  Also, our stove at this apartment doesn't work, so we've had to basically resort to microwave, cold prep foods, and a single burner hotplate. My cupboards and fridge are empty, short of some month old ice cream and leftovers that we've been too lazy to throw away. My family is hungry, but just for the day.  So here is my request, which I will counter with an offer. In exchange for a pizza, I will buy 2 other people in need a pizza in the near future. This is my way of setting aside the guilt of asking, and expanding the assistance of RAOP. I can provide any and all proof and verification needed. And whatever happens, I'd still like to thank RAOP for all their awesomeness.  NOTE: Come Monday, I can get my paycheck advanced to me. Yesterday we just barely slid by, and all will be well from Moday on. I've got a second job that I start Tuesday at. It's just rather...depressing(maybe even desperate) feeling to be hungry, have an empty wallet, and feel like there is nothing I can do. Thanks again Reddit. :)  EDIT: I'm so sorry, I completely forgot to put my location, and I kept saying it in my head. :P Anyways, I'm in South Florida, right by Ft. Lauderdale.  
0	Hello,  I'm a college student at University of California Riverside that just went through all her funds paying off tuition which was due on March 15th. I work but do not get paid until the end of the month. I have proof that I'm a full time student and that I work if needed. Just need something to get by for now especially with finals happening. Thanks.
0	Hi guys!   I'm a student,  typically strapped for cash, and thought I'd give this a go. Me and my girlfriend would love a pizza but we're a bit down on funds.   Will return the favour when I next get paid,  or my student loan comes through! Will also do anything in return like draw a picture,  or anything. :D   In Stoke, UK. 
0	I had a threatened miscarriage last night and I'm stuck resting up until I see my OB tomorrow when the office opens.  I need to go grocery shopping, but really can't yet. And with baby coming I can't justify spending money on a pizza.  I do have a verification code.  Thanks, Reddit. &lt;3
0	Pretty much what it says, I would be eternally grateful for a pizza.
0	I AM 26/3KIDS/LOOKING FOR SOMETHING GOOD TO EAT.FOOD STAMPS RAN OUT/SO IF KIND ENOUGH/IN CANTON OHIO
1	I could really use something simple. I just finished a package of instant mashed potatoes and have a pack of top ramen. My sister plans to send money on Tuesday, I just don't think I can continue feeling the way I am until then. I can make a large pizza last me through Monday.   You can guarantee I will pay it forward to someone as needy as myself when I get receive my first paycheck from my new job I started.  A huge thanks, Reddit.
1	I hope I posted the title correctly. I've been unemployed for most of the year, and I will be starting a new job in 2 weeks. I'm very excited about this new position, however I won't be receiving my first check for another month. My son has been my rock through it all and he continues to grow into a wonderful young man. I know this pizza would mean the world to him as it would be a vast improvement from what we've been eating. Would anyone out there be willing to help me surprise my son with a good meal? Please consider us. Thank you.
0	Camping out to win free piada for a year. I'll take you with me if you send me pizza thanks
0	Any help at all would really make this day seem less shitty than it really is. Thanks
1	I am a single mother of 4 - currently unemployed and looking for work. I've applied to numerous jobs and havent heard anything back as of yet. My children would love to have some pizza for dinner. Just looking for something different to feed them besides mac &amp; cheese.
1	Hi, Reddit.  I'm here because I have a favor to ask.  Tonight is my girlfriend and I's one-year anniversary.  It should be a great night, and sadly I just can't make it happen the way I want it to.  I'm broke and can't afford so much as a few wildflowers, let alone dinner.  I'm not looking for something extravagant, but I was hoping I'd be able to find a generous soul willing to help me surprise her.  She knows I can't afford anything, so I know she'll be surprised.  I even made this throwaway account just so she doesn't see a request if she happens to check my reddit activity.    We're in Minneapolis.  It's a cold night out there and we could really use your help.  Please help me make this an anniversary to remember.  I guarantee that if you can help us out, we'll be talking about the time that reddit helped us celebrate one year together.  
0	I have been on food stamps for about the past 10 months because my job only pays a small living stipend, but my food stamps were cancelled last month. They were cancelled when my phone number changed and I didn't convey this information to the correct person at the welfare office apparently. Anyway, I have been working to get them back but it takes forever and needless to say I have been kind of scraping the bottom of the barrel, food-wise lately.   I would really appreciate a pizza and will definitely pay it forward as soon as I get everything sorted out. Fingers crossed I will be getting a job with a full salary soon anyway!
0	single mommy . family of 8 in Yucca Valley calif . We have been blessed with a house but it took every single penny. I would love for my kids to come home and see the sparkle in thier eyes to see some Pizza. Small Blessings are Beautiful
0	I know I am new at this website but my friend suggested me to come on here for the fact of how kind and generous you people are... low on funds will get my paycheck tomorrow but all my check is going to my rent and bills got approved for snap that will not be getting that till next week.. have no vehicle and no way to go to the food pantry there are not walking distance from here and it's 95 degrees outside I've been eating nothing but raman noodles all week and I'm sick of it a pizza would go a long way I will be sure to return the favor as soon as I get extra money thank you and god bless
0	Dear reddit:  I am a long time follower but have only recently just registered. A long story short is I am fucked!!! I am a 30 year old male from St.Catharines, Ontario (Neil Peart, Linda Evangelista, Paul Bernardo, Karla Homolka, Dave Thomas (SCTV), Alexisonfire, The Trews, etc, etc) who was evicted as of today and my place to live just fell through! I have no where to live so as soon as the sheriff shows up I'm homeless and though I have $40 on me I  want to save it incase I need a ghetto hotel room for me and my girl.  A little back story here, as I feel it's needed to shed some light as how I got to this point; when I moved into this place I was working steady overtime in sales but got laid off soon after I moved here. Not to worry I quickly found full time work, working midnight shift for a company called CCSI which had a contract to clean the New Food Classics plant here in St.Catharines. I have worked since I was 16 and am now 30 so no work was driving me nuts so I took first job I could get.  The job itself wasn't bad but the amount of corners they cut was very noticable. My very first day of work they told me the safety video was broken so I would have to do the training in a few days... I didn't get training until after I called Ministry Of Labor (Ontario) which was after I was already injured, but I I'll speak about this later.   I did the work no problem and was quickly promoted within 2 weeks, though that was partly due to the high turnover there as most people hated the job and quit.  While working there I requested training weekly with my manager to which he would reply some excuse about the dvd still being broken or doing it next week. Not wanting to be a bitch I kept working despite my concerns.  Fast forward a few weeks and we have an inspection from CFIA (Canadian Food Inspection Agency)so everything has to be tip top. One of the duties when CFIA comes apparently was the ceilings of the plant had to be squeegeed dry as to not have any condensation from the cleaning drip into the frozen foods that were being made there (ie; burgers, ribetts).  While I was squeegeeing the cook room while my co-workers were out smoking, not working, I spent 2 and a half hrs doing it myself with a squeegee on the end of a 20 ft pole. Afterwards I couldn't move my neck without severe pain and later after my shift I couldn't sit in a chair without severe pain. I tried to sleep as it was the end of a midnight shift but my muscles would spasm to the point I couldn't sleep. I then called TeleHealth and they advised I go to a walk in clinic.  There I was diagnosed with a sprain of the left and right traps and lats, I think, traps for sure though.and sent for 3 months of physio due to the severity of the sprain. I did the entire 3 months but still no relief but the entire time my pysiotherapist is telling me there is something more there,  A month later Im at a hospital with insane back pain after vaccuming which I hadnt done since injury and I get x-rays. Doctor at hospital I need to see family doctor and have MRI.  See family doctor a month later, do some tests and he sends me for MRI. MRI results come back a month and half later. 2 herniated discs, spinal stenosis and degenerative bone disease caused by injury at work. Prognosis: No bending, No lifting, No twisting... FOR LIFE!  July 4th I see a neurologist for an EMG to determine whether I have back surgery but I have already been told they can't fix my back it will only be if it can improve my quality of life.  Oh and because WSIB says my back should be healed because its only a back sprain that takes 3 months to heal, I am all better, I have no income, no food, am being evicted as of today (June 25th) for back rent 3 months ($3300) but on the bright side I do have a lawyer but it's taking forever and welfare is not enough!!  Can reddit help with a pizza for what may be my last night indoors for a while?   I can prove anything I just dont have a scanner so I would have to take a photo with cell and upload it.    
1	My chemist friend and I will soon be college graduates. We have had fun learning about atoms...but now we want some pizza in our bellies, in a roundabout picnic form. Willing to pay it forward in the future after we get big people jobs!
0	i am giving this a try because i have not had pizza in about 4 months and im really missing the taste of it and basically i would really like a pizza i will be posting offers in the future 
0	My mama is in town,and we have no food...Someone stole my foodstamp card and we are waiting for a new one,if anyone would get us a pizza tonight,my mother and i would be so thankful...she just got off of a greyhound from GA that was a 22 hour ride and could use a nice dinner. Godbless
0	Well just got done workin, Dont get paid till Friday, Would LOVE something delicious tonight, I dont get paid till friday and would be glad to RAOP it Forward then! Not sure if it matters but Its just me in the household so wouldnt cost a whole lot :)  Edit**  A $10 dinner box from pizza hut would be amazing :) comes with everything, Pizza, Stix, and Desert!
0	Hey, just moved into a new place that needed a lot of TLC, would greatly appreciate something to eat as I dont get paid until Thursday. What money I did have went into some cleaning supplies to help make this place livable.  Ohio here, Vermilion to be exact.
1	Today is my 1 year anniversary to my amazing wife. We live paycheck to paycheck and my paycheck didn't come so I can't even get her dinner. When my paycheck finally comes, I will do the right thing and fulfill 2 requests on this sub-reddit. Cheers to paying it forward!  EDIT:  Thank you Threedice!  We will be sure to mention your kindness when paying it forward in the next few days!
0	Hello I am posting another request I have not got pizza d yet and I am trying it agian..I am out of food right now and I am very hungry dont get paid until tomorrow will someone help me eat tonight please ..Hopeing i will get pizzad tonight thanks..Will return the favor when i get payed tomorrow thanks
0	My little man was sick last night and we both got little to no sleep. His fever is finally breaking and his appetite is coming back. I asked him what he wanted to eat and he said either pizza or Pogo's (corn dogs on a stick), neither of which are in my freezer. I am exhausted and if I didn't have to cook it'd be amazing, but I don't have the money to order out. 
0	He's a 20 y/o Canadian. We live in different cities each attending a different uni so we frequently skype and he's always talking about how hungry he is and how he's just dying for some decent food (and pizza happens to be his favourite food). He's pretty broke and is trying to pay off uni tuition so he's saving every penny for it. I'd buy him some but i've only got just enough for myself. If there's someone out there looking to help a broke student out, let me know!
0	I've been out of the country for over a year and a half. Before this time I struggled a lot with depression and it was this friend who helped pull me through! I'm a different person now, and I'd love to sit down over a pizza and catch up!
0	I'm currently skint with only pasta in the cupboard fighting through the 5 essays I've got to submit in the next few weeks. Would really appreciate some pizza goodness to help feed the belly as well as the brain.
1	EDIT: THANK YOU SO MUCH To Piccolittle for sending me a pizza, it is truly appreciated and was a wonderfully kind act.  As the title says.. my birthday was terrible. Saw a grand total of 3 people in my family, only one of which actually remembered it was my birthday.. Asked my mum to do one thing for me, which was to not drink on my birthday.. and she was drinking when I got there at lunchtime.  Another member of my family demanded to know why I was upset that they hadn't remembered it was my birthday. -.-  Unemployed too, so money is super tight.. would absolutely love a pizza right now. Thanks.
1	Haven't had a real meal for the past 3 days paying off all my bills and having just enough for next month rent.  I'm jobless right now and constantly applying for jobs.  Reason why I moved out here was because I wanted to prove to my parents I could live without their help.  I must say it's been hard but I'm learning a lot about myself here.  For instance, being humble and learning to hustle everyday looking for a job.  I also realized that my parents must have worked their asses off to raise me and my older brother.  It's hard enough taking care of myself.  But yeah, I could definitely use a pizza from domino's and once I get my job, I will never forget this gratuitous act and I am going to offer a pizza on RAOP to another who else is in need.  Thanks for reading!
0	4 18-20 yr olds living off of one of our roommates BF's mom's shitty frozen diet foods. We could really use some "real" food. Only one of use has a real job, 2 work part time and barely make enough for rent, and the fourth (me) is unemployed, and has officially run out of money.
0	Alternatively, will write limerick for pizza.  I appreciate it.
0	Hey guys, my friend just told me about this and I'm starving and don't know when I'll have money or food again. I just started working and all my last check went to bills and gas to get to work. I'm a type I diabetic who's in some need of food, and a pizza would be amazing right now.  I'm willing to play some Team Fortress, Killing Floor, or anything else (as long as I have the game lol) w/ anyone who helps!  Thanks in advance! =)  
0	just looking to get some good eats. i'm broke until pay day tomorrow, and all my co-workers decided to order elaborate carry out food. now my job smells like a cafeteria and all i have to eat is the inside of my cheek. a random act of pizza would be amazing, and would gladly return the favor post-pay day to you (pizza buyee) or anyone else in need of pizza. ;\ thanks!
0	I have been working odd jobs the past month just to pay off a knee surgery and make rent. I had a day dream about a slice of cheese pizza and ramen just isn't cutting it right now. Will you help out a lonely Fargo girl?
0	Hello RAoP. I simply don't have money left after paying bills this month. I finished off the last of the rice earlier today and there is literally nothing left in the kitchen to eat. I ran out of options and am starting to get really hungry. If anyone could please help me out I would be extremely grateful and willing to do anything i can to repay you! Thanks.
0	So this isn't a sob story, I just want to finally have a gluten free pizza tonight for the return of Whose Line! I'm pretty sure Domino's is the only chain that has gluten free pizza, but if anyone else knows a place that has some I would be grateful to know about it! (I hope it's at least close to being as good as a regular pizza....oh god I miss it so much)
0	I'm waiting for my G.I. Bill to come in, hopefully by the end of the month. Until then I am stuck with 99 cent loaves of bread and peanut butter which has also run out. I have 3 dollars in my account and I'm starving. Make a random request and I will fulfill it!  Since I made this post so late I don't think I will see any response. Thanks for those who read this post. Good luck in your RAOP!
1	Hey everyone,  So, I was a student at Central Michigan University last semester, but due to financial reasons, I couldn't attend this semester.  I used the last of my money recently to sign onto a friends lease, so my bank accounts are currently zero-ed out, and I don't have a credit card.    I had gotten hired by a pyramid scheme place, and they didn't pay me, even though I met the criteria to get paid.  I just had orientation for a new job, but I won't start for another week, and won't get paid for another two.  I have almost no food in this house, except for some bread, and some crackers.  Is there any way someone could send me some pizza? It'd be greatly appreciated, and I would pay it forward once I have some cash.   Thanks for reading.
1	So... I don't really know how to request pizza, especially since what I have to ask for probably makes me sound really... un-needy. I'm 24, flew myself out to Columbus Ohio to work with Cirque Du Soleil temporarily and only work four hours a day and we haven't gotten paid yet. I'm down to $100 and I use most of that to help get me to and from the Cirque site and I haven't eaten anything except some Bananas since yesterday.   It's hard to ask for help, since I put myself here because I want to one day work for Cirque Du Soleil -- instead of just a temporary job working with a show while they are in a city. I plan on trying to follow them for a few more shows and hope the experience helps set my resume apart, as well as that I can practice some aerial arts (trapeze).  I absolutely love the show and the people I am following and it's really the show I want to work for but if I were to actually land a job with Cirque, I honestly would not mind any show.  Regardless, gluten makes me very sick so pizza typically isn't something I can get unless I order multiple little domino's gluten free pizza. I don't really know who else delivers in the downtown columbus area that has gluten free, and also since it's 1am.  I don't expect pizza, since GF is such a hassle but thank you for having a subreddit like this exist. 
0	Just moved to koreatown for a new job and am broke till next Friday and could use a hand getting an Easter meal. Thanks in advance to anyone who helps.
0	Praying for a RAoP.
1	Hey guys, this is my first time posting on here. I've been following this subreddit for a while, and asking for a pizza never really came to mind. Well my birthday is today, and normally I take myself somewhere to celebrate, but after recently paying my college tuition, I was left with [a little over a dollar](http://i.imgur.com/bnKd2.png) in my account. I'd really appreciate a RAOP.   Thanks :)
0	I have a jerb but the bills and car repairs ate up all my funds till next week, Roomates are all out of town and I was hoping a fellow redittor could hook me up with an online order for a Dominos medium pizza. It's only like 6 bucks! :/
0	I have a gluten-allergy unfortunately but Domino's makes gluten-free pizza that I don't react to!   I would appreciate this like crazy and am genuinely planning to pay it forward asap. 
1	Gonna be honest here, I sort of shot myself in the foot. Went to Seattle to meet some buddies from a game I play and kind of spent a bit too much money... We had a blast though! PAX 2011 YEAH! 2 days after PAX 2011... not so yeah.   Anyway, I get paid on Thursday (well, maybe Thursday, if not this Thursday than next Thursday and if that's true I'm super nyerked) and will DEFINITELY pay the pizza back to some other redditor! Not going to whine if I don't get a pizza but it'd be pretty awesome if my broke, gamer ass got fed D:   I've been following reddit for awhile now because of my boyfriend, so even though my account is new I've been a lurker on this website for a few months now. He's actually the one who suggested I try reddit because he's at work and can't be much help atm :]   Anything would be appreciated guys!  (And as much as I love this sub reddit, I feel so guilty using it ;___; )  
0	yep. like i said....im broke and dont have much but i do have two copies of dota i can give away to you or any random, or do whatever you want with them. So if someone helps me out, it would be greatly appreciated and I will pay it forward when the time comes and i have extra cash
0	Hiya, this is for my friend, not me. She's a freelance makeup artist juggling several part-time gigs and school and she's been having a hard time making ends meet lately. She had an especially shitty day today and I'd love to send her a pizza to cheer her up, but I'm currently unemployed (yay) so I thought maybe Reddit could help me.  **Edit: Oooops, she recently moved to Long Island; I forgot.**
0	My best friend, who I haven't seen in THREE MONTHS!!!, came into town last night to celebrate for her 23rd birthday! Being it was my duty to show her a good time last night that she would never remember (until the pics make it Facebook...mission blackout accomplished) it is my duty to pamper her and take care of her today....and she would LOVE some pizza to cure her hangover!!! :-)   Sincerely, Extremely hungover yet amazing best friend ;-)
0	Hello, my name is Nicole, and I wish I could be here under different circumstances, last month my mother was diagnosed with Leiomyosarcoma it is a form of cancer that is very strong and when diagnosed with it the outcome is usually bad. She had an abdominal hysterectomy and we were hoping that it removed all of the cancer but it has not  Mother went to the Dr. today and we were told it has spread to her lungs and her throat, she goes to a different cancer/radiation specialist on june 7th to begin radiation therapy.  So i don't think this post belongs here and I honestly do not know where to post it, mom is sleeping right now and I am glad for that but I don't know what to do anymore.   I know I am asking so much from strangers out here and you don't know me from a hill of beans but I don't know what to do, my husband is working 2 jobs to help us and my mother and I am on disability for an old hip injury.  So if anyone can help please I would be grateful, please can you perhaps help us find a smaller home for rent in the Sacramento Ca area?  We are renting a 5 bedroom home to also care for my older brother who has Multiple Sclerosis but we can't do this alone anymore and I feel so lost, I am trying to be strong for mother, just like she has been there for us all these years and it is hard.  A smaller home could be even a 3 bedroom, we can make a living room into a sleeping area if need be but I just can't do this by myself and I am afraid of our landlord when he hears we cannot afford this home, I don't know what is going to happen and I am scared.  Thank you for reading this and I am very sorry it is so long but I feel you should know about me before making your decision to help my us all.   
0	I have no sob story, and I do have food here. However Pizza is out of my budget right now and I won't be getting any money until next week and I'd really love a Cheese and Tomato Pizza from Domino's!  The cheapest order for delivery at Domino's is Â£8.50, which I'd be overjoyed with! Or they are doing an offer for any pizza, any size, for Â£10  I really like the idea of this community and I'm hoping I can contribute back when I have the funds to do so :)  Thanks very much if you do decide to contribute! **Don't forget I'm in the UK, Kent!**
0	Hey everyone! I really want Pizza and I know there are people on here that do too. If there's anyone on here that resides from Toronto, Ontario maybe we can cut a deal? It would make my time easier as well as yours ya dig?  
0	Hi guys  I was wondering if anyone fancied giving out a pizza tonight?  I'm currently having a LOTR marathon (on Two Towers right now) and could really do with a nice pizza to go with it.  It's also my cake day! :D
0	If some generous soul is awesome enough to buy me a pizza tonight, I will either:  a) Buy someone else a pizza when I've got the cash (pay it forward and all)  **OR**  b) Play you a song. I play tuba! I can also play guitar/bass decently, nothing special though.    *Disclaimer: I'm not a very good singer.*  Your choice!  I live in Southern CA.
1	I had posted a request in food pantry and it was suggested maybe to come here. I just was needing help for tomorrow, I will be able to shop on Tuesday. It's just me and 3 kids and yes I'm new and I know that's frowned upon. If you can help I can send you the money back this week. If you can't help please don't be mean, I'm not used to having to ask for help and it's hard for me. 
1	I can forward the e-mailed work schedule as proof, and will send you proof of paying it forward when things improve for me financially.  Many thanks in advance for your help!
1	I pretty much just want to eat some pizza and watch a cheesy romantic comedy, possibly a tear jerker and forget about my week.  Papa John's would be cool.  Much appreciated.  Edit: Pizza'd by pizzamom!  Thanks so much!
0	Also, broke as broke can be... with no car. Spent all my money trying to keep my studio alive; if this project doesn't work out, it's bye bye dream time, hello 9-5. Not exactly a sob story, but yea... When I have money I promise to re-pizza!
0	I'm 18, just started a boring job full time. Money is not bad. But dirt broke being 18 with a car payment, insurance, rent, a girlfriend. and school. ugh haha. no worries tho, hope everyone enjoys their pizza!
1	Hey all! This is a throwaway, I've been lurking RAOP for quite a while and I'm really inspired by what's been going on, however never though I'd be on here asking.  I'm a student in Seattle and currently I have around 5$ for the next week. I'm looking for someone willing to get me a pizza that will last me the next few days until I get some money.  Edit: It says "Alone". I recently moved to Seattle with no friends, and no family.  Edit: That sounds too dismal, it's just boring.  I will return the favor with a pie later on this month. I love everything about RAOP and if someone helps me right now, I'd love to help in the future. I can provide a picture of me Omnoming it when it arrives.  Thanks guys! &lt;3 
0	I'm curious to see about the magic that is RAOP in action. I didn't have a bad day, no sob story here, just kinda hungry and don't care to cook. x)  Anyone wanna throw me a pie?
0	I've been cleaning all day, and waiting for this mushroom market to finish building has got me really wanting a slice.  
0	We have a 1/4 of a box of rice to our names and are done our exams tomorrow night! Help us get through!
0	I've been working at an awesome internship in Hollywood this summer, and I think it would be great if I could get a large cheese pizza for my boss as thanks. The other intern and I already have a card and simple gift for him. Would anyone be kind enough to help out and make our last day (8/12) really awesome?  *Edit:* We'll take pics of us eating the pizza!
1	So I am a college kid who's carrying on a long distance relationship with a girl back from where I live in Colorado. She is coming out to visit me this weekend (gets here Friday night) and I'd love to have a nice pizza waiting for her after the 5 1/2 hour drive she has to make. Unfortunately, in order for her to visit she has to stay in a hotel and we're splitting the cost (considering she paid for gas), meaning I do not have the extra money to buy a pizza. Hook a brother up?  EDIT: As a reward, I will send the generous donor a mash-up of Gangnam Style, Party Rock Anthem, Like a G6, Pretty Fly (For a White Guy), and Bad Touch that is no longer available for public download, but very well mixed and great to listen to.
0	My birthday is in two days and I don't usually celebrate it. But, I would enjoy a pizza for my birthday.  I don't *need* this. I have money, but I would enjoy this gift since I won't receive any other gifts for my birthday.  Thanks!
0	i lost my job several weeks ago and because of that i lost my apartment now im living in my car and its got a flat in the walmart parking lot i have run out of food ive been living on ramen every few days but im out and i have no way of feeding myself i need some help thank you and god bless
0	Hey r/RAOP, I'm currently on a school trip to DC (I'm from Canadia, eh) and we just got back to our hotel in Alexandria, VA after a loooooonnnng day of walking aboot. We've spent most of our money on food and was wondering if anyone could help us out?
1	My roommates and I are pretty strapped for cash, we are all completely broke and behind on some of our bills. I haven't had money for food in a while, subsisting off of whatever I can steal from my campus eatery (hey, I'm paying for it anyways, right?) so I figured I would ask reddit for assistance on the off chance that someone could help. I would love to surprise my roommates with some hot pizza goodness.  
1	I got fired from my job (car broke down and I worked about 25 miles away from home) about 2 months ago and have been managing but the money has just finally run out.  I literally had cheese and pickles here to eat last night.  I'm starting a temp job on Sunday (finally :D) so hopefully I will be able to give in the near future.    This is a great subreddit btw.  It really restores my faith in humanity.  
0	It's 4/20, I'm in Ithaca NY, and I just smoked an 8 bowl session with 12 of my friends and an awesome mom, so I have pretty serious munchies but no food and would be very grateful for the donation of a plain pizza. Happy holidays fellow stoners. 
0	I'm here in hopes of pizza!  I don't have many talents, but I can try to do handstands again!  Food is much appreciated!  
0	Have 10 bucks need it for gas.  Wife, 2 1/2 year old daughter, and I would love some pie. Ill pizza someone else Thursday when I get paid. Thanks!
1	Lost my job in December.  I've been actively looking for a new one.  Worked as a security guard for a week before getting laid off.  Been going to interviews but still no positions yet.  I've completely run out of money and am basically stuck in my house, saving what little gas I have left for pursuing job prospects.  I've been eating through the last of my ramen during this past week or so and slowly depleting my reserve of oatmeal.  If anyone could send a pepperoni pizza, I'll be sure to keep the pizza-karma flowing once I land on my feet.  I'm also completely open to repaying the pizza favor with some non-money related favor, just let me know what you need.  ***EDIT:*** Pizza just arrived, thanks to clearmoon247!!!!!
1	School is back up. Just getting over being sick, with whatever public school kids are brewing this year. Going to be a rainy week. Finally getting my daughter back again for a little bit after a long week at her moms. Already have some movies picked out. Was thinking of throwing a little pizza party for her. We can try to repay with artwork, pictures of our cat -- (he is stunning), and/or good deeds.   Daughter has been getting on here now that she reads pretty well, and was going to post from her account but it's less than a month and was too new. Even though she mostly just likes to get on here and upvote pictures from /r/owls. She's loving karma, but... Getting pizza'd on here would totally blow her mind. Personally, I could use seeing something nice from the world. Anyway, many thanks to any kind strangers that might come our way.
0	I am really depressed, job seeking not going so well. I am sick of eating sandwiches and rice (but happy to be eating something). I know this is a bit of a long shot but I would love a pizza
0	Hey guys, me and my friend Taylor are both in bed sick. I have a pretty shitty cold, and she has strep throat. We both have a plethora of finals to study for Our dining hall, not that we really want to eat there, starts serving food at 5 PM. We could really use a little bump. If you want any verification, let me know. I have a pile of used tissues right here if you want a picture of that. I would be willing to send gifts of drawings to anyone who sends a pizza.   [Here](http://i.imgur.com/zSK5C3O.jpg) is my Civil Liberties whiteboard that I have been working with.
0	Unfortunately, dominos doesn't take paypal :P I'm in canada if that matters. I posted this earlier, but I thikn it got hooked by the spam filter
0	Tampa Bay Florida area, my roomie and I just hit up the mall and got gifts for our families. We tried to go to McDonalds on the way home and be Dollar Menunaires but my card was declined! Seems that even though we're working insane hours (retail slaves) for the holidays,  we underestimated our money &amp; now we're broke as a joke till payday with no food in the fridge. I've never posted here before but now seems like a great time to rely on the kindness of strangers. :]
0	This message is for everyone.  I hope you'll all take a moment to read it.  I just sat down to eat a bowl of noodles.  As I said my grace and waited for the food to cool down, I was overwhelmed by a million thoughts.  I just wanted to share them and maybe let someone know they're not alone.  Last week I "celebrated" one year of being unemployed.  Ironically it coincided with 6 months of being officially divorced, though the marriage was over long before that.  Today marks two weeks since I scrounged around the house to find every penny and spent them all to cover the bills.  For 2 weeks I've tried to get by without any money.  I've restricted my use of the car to only places I absolutely had to go.  I haven't been to the grocery store in God knows how long.  The first week wasn't awful.  I didn't have much in terms of food around the house, but it forced me to be creative.  This second week has been much less enjoyable.  Some cereal, some pasta, a little of this, and less of that.  You don't realize how long two weeks is until you find yourself counting down every day.  I am hoping to get some relief in terms of an unemployment check on Wednesday.  What I was told though is it could be delayed because I have to re-qualify after one year.  What a proud moment for me.  I've run into issues before, and it doesn't matter that it's not your fault, they usually can't get the money to you until the following Monday.  We'll see how that goes.  I've had Wednesday circled on the calendar in my head as this all magical day.  Realistically most of the money is already spoken for in upcoming bills, but I'll have a little bit of money for grocery shopping.  Right now, and I realize this is a gross combination, I'm craving a glass of milk, and a hamburger :)    Anyway, the short story is that life sucks right now and I was kind of getting down.  Actually I was really in a bad place.  And as I said a blessing over the "meal", I realized that there are millions of people that would gladly step into my shoes.  That my life may seem rough right now, but that's more of a testament to how far I had risen, than to how far I've fallen.    I just want to say thank you to all of you on here that are helping people.  It's an honorable calling.  And to all of you that truly need help, just know that it will get better.  I firmly believe that we will never be given more than we can handle, and we're never in it alone.  I know how sad and depressing life can be, but I also know how you don't have to look far to find someone who needs help more than ourselves.    I guess I just wanted to say hang in there.  To everyone.  Keep fighting.  Don't give up.  If you're having a bad day, if you want to rant and rave or scream and cry, send me a message.  If you got that job interview you've been praying for, let me know.  I want to hear the bad.  I want to share in the good.  I have tried to weather the storm alone, and it doesn't work.  I don't need someone to carry me, but it sure is nice to have someone to lean on.  So as Tiny Tim say, "God bless us, everyone." 
0	My cat ran away and I have to stay in my house so I can get him if he comes back so I can't get up to pizza hut to get food   :(  help please
1	This past week at work, I fell off an office chair that was missing a bolt and ended up having to get a tetanus shot and 6 x-rays. I'm living from paycheck to paycheck, so I'm eating meagerly as it is, and the lost wages from the work I had to miss mean even less food from this next one, though still enough to get by. Also, I've been in a lot of pain, which has made it a really shitty week. A pizza would do wonders to improve it.  Note: I looked into worker's comp, which doesn't start compensating for lost wages until you've missed three days of work. I wasn't gone for three days because I just got a new second part-time job and didn't want to miss more than a day for fear of losing it.
0	This month's been a little tough, and pretty much been relegated to ramen for the past week. If some kind person wishes to help break the monotony, that'd be awesome. 
0	Hello, my name is Bret and I'm originally from South Florida, now I reside here in Conyers. I'm here to ask if someone would be decent enough to help me with some dinner tonight or tomorrow while I take care of my kids. I've been separated for nearly ten months now. I drank myself half to death and now I'm working on getting myself back to my feet. I don't have a job and my brother has been paying my rent plus utilities for the last two months. He can't afford to give me anymore cash at he moment, he suggested I try here because you gave him some pizza a while back. I really don't want to feed my kids the same slop I gave them last time. Fish sticks and macaroni, a side of applesauce, they hate it and I practically eat it nightly. I've got two young girls to feed, if someone could help me I'd never forget it. Hopefully that way their mother won't be so hesitant to let them spend the night with me next time they ask to. I'm here if you have any questions or if I left anything out. Hope you'll be well.
0	Me and a friend are just loking for some pizza. We just had to move out of our house and are now staying with a friend. Were saving as much as we can to find a new place to live so its pretty much been ramen and rice for awhile now. A nice pizza would be amazing if anyone can help. Thanks.
1	Heya! I just recently moved from CA to Texas for school and it's left me pretty broke. Living with my aunt, but we have no groceries in the house and I'm going to be alone all weekend by myself. I don't like taking things for free, and I won't have any money to pay it forward for a week or two. So if I get a pizza I'll [play it forward](http://www.reddit.com/r/playitforward/) and give away 3 games that are in my inventory. I probably won't get the pizza until tomorrow sometime to hold me over until Sunday. Thanks all! Any other questions just ask. :)  Edit: Guess I should mention that I'm in Edinburg, TX :D
0	I just heard about this subreddit and thought it was the coolest thing ever. Like the title said, I get paid tomorrow and right now my bank account is under a dollar. I've run out of food staples and there is a domino's up the street from my house. I could go pick up a carryout order and it would really make my day better instead of living off toast or buttered noodles another day.
0	We are doing projects/writing papers/preparing for tests and ramen just isn't cutting it anymore. Could really use some pizza! :) 
1	I work with FIrst Graders at an after school program- this week I would like to give them a little thanksgiving party, I just don't have the funds to do anything substantial food-wise.  Anyhow, I would love to teach the kids about random acts of pizza and give them something to really be grateful for. I am happy to share a verification code. 
0	Evening, Reddit! I've had a rough day, and a pizza would make it so much better! I'm getting paid on Friday, so I'll be sure to give the gift of pizza when I can, but right now I'm hungry and sick of soup. Please help me if you can! Thank you!
0	My roommate and I finished our finals today, of course we had one at the last timeslot (U of I has a terrible final schedule this year). We'd like to celebrate but it's starting to storm pretty bad out at the moment. A pizza would be delicious, this semester was a rough one. Pretty please? :) I'll gladly pay it forward to a college kid who asks next time around.
0	I'd buy it myself, but he lives in Washington and I live in Texas, and I don't have a debit card. Since the technology to email a pizza hasn't been invented yet, I'll thank anyone who orders him one by drawing them something in return :D
0	So, I wouldn't ever think to actually do something like this, and I don't post that often.  But I'm hungry and just about of money and getting very tired of ramen, beans and rice, and ham sandwhiches. The fact that my girl left me this morning makes me even more desperate. (She usually cooks my dinner) If there's anyone out there that could help a fellow redditor you could bring a lot of help to sad soul.  Thanks in advance to anyone kind enough. Will post pics of the pizza and my happy face enjoying them :)
0	We were leaving from his high school today (I do a bridge program so I go to my tech college and get back to my base school before it gets out), and as he was driving (north) down the road to leave the school, this guy barrels through the parking lot (going west) and we hit him. He has a volvo, so the external damage was minimal for a car crash, but the interior damage was bad. The windshield was cracked, a bunch of the paneling was destroyed, one of the front headlights was cracked and the airbags messed a bunch of things up. I think it's what messed up the front windshield. I hit my head and he got cuts and burns from the airbags and probably lost his car (nicknamed victor).  The other driver was honest about it, but the officer said that since it was on school ground (technically private property for some reason) he could not claim fault. So now my friend is going to have to battle with insurance on just getting his car fixed and the money for that. I'm going to try and drive him around whenever I have enough gas to go anywhere. Any help is appreciated and he was planning on getting some pizza today, but he said "I just want to relax for now." Everyone decided to call off the little social gathering we had, but it would be sweet if he could still get a pizza. Thanks guys and sorry this was so long.  TL;DR: Friend gets hit by another student driver on his birthday. His car is wrecked, may not get insurance money, and birthday is ruined. Thanks!
0	Update: She woke up, I'm cooking dinner. Butter chicken &amp; rice. No pizza needed anymore. Thanks for the kind wishes all!  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Came home from group to a girlfriend who has cried herself to sleep because her friends have bailed on plans with her again. Hell, one of them has bailed on treating her like a human being anymore in general.  I want to have a treat for her when she wakes, but we're running on empty money-wise. She loves pizza with chicken and bacon on it, but if that can't happen, I'll start cooking for her as soon as she wakes up - just don't want to make any noise right now and wake her up because she actually looks peaceful (although puffy-eyed from crying).
1	My buddy and I just went on a mission across Chicago to supposedly pick up my paycheck. Turns out they didn't have it, and now we just spent our last dollar on two slurpees from 7-11.    Would love a pizza right now, and Papa Johns would seem like the best fit, seeing as how it's right down the street from where I'm by, but would take any of the big 3. Appreciate it.    Will pay it forward once my paycheck actually comes through.
0	I smashed my finger under a milk crate at work and I am unable to work right now but I will get workmans comp friday. But till them im at home with pain meds but no food to take with it. A pizza will hold me over til friday. Any help would be appreciated and reciprocated friday.
0	I hope this really works.. I NEED something to go right today!! I am hoping to get a pizza for my family tonight. I got sent home early from work, spent most of the rest of the day  in doctor offices with my daughter, who still does not feel good..nor do they know whats wrong with her. She could really use some cheering up. Thank you for taking the time to read this... We are in Washington state.
0	I am so absolutely broke right now me and my boyfriend have been living off of Ramen for a few weeks. I have a Torn ACL and pretty much confined to the chair. A pizza would really brighten our day up (: 
0	Mom, dad, and young son, far too lazy and far too far away from a pizza joint, request pie.  Here We stayed, 'cuz I tolja so! URBS INDOMITA!
0	My boyfriend introduced me to reddit a while back. I'm from Finland and I have only 0,27 cents in my bank but I'd like to surprise him with a pizza since he's been having a rough week, and also has no money to get anything to eat. I wonder if anyone here would be able to help, I'd appreciate it a lot.
0	I've been out of work and I finally just got a job. A friend I know who works at 7-11 gave me a application today to fill out and turn in tomorrow for a job and I would be extremely grateful if I could eat well tonight (it's been a while) I figured this was the place to post! Much love and I appreciate what everyone does here. I lurk a lot but reading here usually makes my day! Thanks for reading.
0	Unfortunately I only have about $30 to last the week, or else I'd buy everyone pizza myself. I will pay it forward the second I get paid next week!
1	First of all sorry for not being an amazing poster on Reddit yet. Still learning the basics of how to post and all the formatting and such.   REQUEST FULFILLED!! THANK YOU SO MUCH!  
0	So, yes. We both work retail to make ends meet, and normally this works out for us, but given that it's early in the year and retail money sucks, we were budgeted to just barely scrape by. Now, with this development, I had to use my last $20 for her Metro fare so she can get to work. That was gonna go towards PB sammiches. Whoops.  This all seems like a sob story more worthy of the pantry or assistance, but it's no life or death situation. Reddit-flavored pizza would brighten the week for us till we get paid on Friday, but we'll still be around otherwise.
0	So where he works he somehow got free pizza for dinner and texted me I was on my own. I told him to bring me some and he said he can't...they ate it all. :(  I'm in Sherwood Arkansas and thought I might give this a try. Think it might make him laugh if I get a pizza too. :)   EDIT: Ok cancel this request. A friend called me and if going to take me out to dinner. :)
0	With midterms coming up I'm cooped up in my room studying for business law and only have a few bucks to my name after paying rent. A pizza sounds phenomenal.  
1	Hi! My parents are out of town and I'm flat broke in real life money BUT I have some money in a paypal account. Would anyone be willing to order me a pizza and then accept a paypal reimbursement + a 5 dollar tip?  A magnificent redditor by the name of mmmcandy has helped me out. He is one bad ass mother fucker... who likes candy. Thank you!
0	I got out of the Marine Corps several months ago. I am from Texas, and for the past few months I've been preparing to start college in Florida. The original plan was I would drive here to Florida, take a test, then return home and do my coursework online for the first 90 days, which would give me time to pull the funds together for the move to Florida. Unfortunately, they failed to inform me that the online option only applies to students who do exceptionally well on that test, which I did not. Just for the first trip, I had to sell something that was very important to me. Then I took the test and they told me I either had to give up my dream of becoming a student at their university, or move to Florida immediately. I returned to Texas and did everything I could think of to raise money for the early move, and in a final act of desperation, I sold even more of my belongings. Now I am in Florida, with 2 boxes of clothes, sleeping on a fellow classmate's (who also has no money) couch, with $2.00 in my wallet, wondering what I will do for food for the next 30 days, which is when my Veteran's Benefits kick in and I will finally be able to afford to eat. I would LOVE it and greatly appreciate it if some kind soul would buy me a pizza to enjoy tonight.
0	Like the title says, I'm a poor college student practically starving. I've been eating some bootlegged Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal for about 5 days now, 3 times a day. Just today, I filled up what would be my last bowl to be ready to end the day. Of course, something happened, I found a beetle on my cereal, I had taken multiple spoonfuls at this point and didn't notice it. Did I mention I was terrified and grossed out of bugs? My only option was to through out the cereal, it took me some guts to even drink the milk at the end. (Didn't want to waste it) I live with my parents, and I have to drive a 1989 Lincoln Town Car to college every day. I can barely afford to pay for the gas every 5 days to go to and from school. All in all I'm starving, trying to finish my homework for the day. Some pizza would be awesome at this point.   **Beetle Picture** http://i.imgur.com/TWdXh.jpg
0	I'm a poor guy. My family and I usually have enough food to go around for the week but this week it's been pretty bad. I know it seems kind of pitiful and rude to ask, but I'd just like a pizza for my family and I. Thank you very much for looking through this.
0	Hey friends!  I just moved to Kansas City three weeks ago and I was recently fired from my job, serving at a movie theatre, but I quickly got a job serving at a local restaurant.  Unfortunately, I have to wait a bit for my paycheck, and I've had -.87 cents in my account since last Saturday.  Just a small cheese pizza would be ridiculously appreciated. 
0	I have been unable to find work for a year now and take care of my uncle as he is partially disabled. My mom is the only breadwinner in the home and it's not much. If anyone would like to help us out it would be greatly appreciated and paid forward once I am able to. 
1	Here is why today sucks:  -Guy I've been seeing for a little over a month socked me in the face last night, so that's over.  -Can't find a fucking job.  -Roommates just ditched on us after eating our food and not paying bills... because they found a better place.  -Don't get foodstamps refilled until the 9th.  -Totally coming down with something.  Damn it, I would love someone forEVER if I got pizza'd. I'm in New Orleans. The only thing close-ish to me that delivers is Domino's.  Le sigh.  **EDIT: Thanks to czhunc, I'm nomming on some delicious chicken-bacon-spinach pizza right now, there's another pizza next to it, and this is an amazing end to a day that started out the crappiest in recent memory. czhunc rocks my face off (and breakfast tomorrow is going to be AMAZING)!**
1	HR somehow managed to stuff up my pay this week, and was unable to purchase any groceries at least until monday.  This might sound like a sob story, but I literally have nothing to feed my kids tonight.  Will provide photos for proof if needed. 
0	took a corner too hard going like... 20 mph! On a 150cc scooter. I know I'm hardcore like that, craving pepperoni. Will pay it forward when I get paid.
0	Preferably something with bacon and pepperoni, medium size at least. PM for more details. Thanks in advance!
0	I have no other reasons i am just hungry and have no food and no shops nearby to walk to. I will be sooo happy and grateful for someone to order me a pizza. :) Im from Buckinghamshire
0	Making dinner and the chicken that was supposed to be fresh smells like a newly birthed Orc. Mom had to work a double and my stepdad, douchenozzle that he is, took off without his phone. If someone could buy a pizza for us that'd be great.
1	Hello people. I found out about this website from a friend and I just don't believe it to be true. If it is, I will become a key contributor to this website to help the needy. Nothing makes me happier than helping fellow mankind. If someone could send me a pizza to verify and so I could have a tasty lunch, I'll make sure to return the favor and keep donating.
0	So a friend I haven't seen in a while to hang out with a few other people that came over tonight. This happened unexpectedly and, unfortunately, I couldn't plan ahead as he is broke and so are we. We only have a bag of broccoli in the freezer and without sounding totally pathetic I decided, as a last resort, to see if RAOP could possibly help out with this predicament. Once I get paid, I will absolutely pay it forward on here.  Number of People: 5   Location: Athens, OH   Have Verification Code: Yes  
1	My girlfriend was over for a visit here in Germany for the last two weeks (left yesterday) and for some dumb reason spent a bit too much money and now can not afford food for today nor tomorrow untill I can get some cash back.  Would love to get a random pizza sometime this week and I can give back when I get back on my feet money wise
0	Pizza is delicious, this is a simple fact.  I would totally order myself a pizza, but that costs money, which unfortunately I don't have.  (I also don't have the best grasp of grammar apparently).  Guelph, Ontario is my location.  Sorry I missed that in the side bar!
0	We have our son who came to visit and we are so embarrassed as we didnt know and dont have much to pick from. We live on a limited amount of food a week for a family of 3 . So we are asking for a pizza for 4 . We would really enjoy it and would love to sit like old times with our son and talk . I am the only one working as my wife has Lupus and cant work anymore. So living on one pay check is very hard . There is nothing left for a yummy cheese pizza . We havent had a good pizza from Papa johns in ages ! We would really enjoy it for Sundays dinner . Thank you 
0	[](/pinkieawe "no.. birthday party??") It's my birthday and I don't get paid until tomorrow.   I thought it was going to be today, but direct deposit from my husband's new job hasn't kicked in yet so we have to wait for the physical check.  I'm not going to starve without a pizza or anything, in fact I have spaghetti leftovers in the fridge right now. Hubby's at work though and I have nothing to drink in the house other than tapwater and I'm battling a gnarly caffeine headache (tylenol is toning it down a bit but not completely). So if someone could get me a pizza and a 2liter of soda, I could get caught up on My Little Pony on Netflix and have a little pizza party to celebrate getting my new stuffed [Rainbow Dash](http://www.buildabear.com/shopping/productDetail.jsp?productId=prod11020066&amp;selectedParentCategoryId=cat110197&amp;categoryId=cat10760001&amp;dressMeMode=false) tomorrow.   [](/soawesome "I get to go home with spazure tomorrow?! Is it MY birthday?!?!")
0	it's new year's day here in mendoza, argentina, and everything is closed.  no delivery.  no supermarkets.  no (few?) gas stations.  i've just moved into a temporary apartment while the mother and brother of a friend with a new baby stay in my apartment.  and i don't have much for supplies in the house-- i haven't had time to stock up on much other than gatorade and water.  not even a bottle of wine.  i think there are a couple of bananas and an egg...  is anyone up to the challenge of getting me a pizza today?  i'm in central mendoza (chile and colon)  i'll pay it forward. if you hook me up, i'll hook up someone up back at home.
1	Hey there pizzaland! Pizza would be pretty awesome right now. Definitely don't need it, not starving or anything, but a nice pie is always tasty and would be a welcome treat from all the sandwiches I've been surviving on. I'm currently saving up all my money until after next pay day so I can go see my BFF graduate bootcamp in San Diego. I've been scrimping and saving to make this happen, so unfortunately pizza is just not in the budget right now.    If anyone would make my night and send me a pizza pie - that would put me over the moon. I'll definitely return the deed in a few weeks once I have some extra spending money (august 9th).  May the pizza deities guide and protect you.
0	So I currently have $3 in my bank account and a job's been hard to come by with every place I've been to being fully staffed due to the holiday season.  If anyone is feeling particularly generous, I'd greatly appreciate a pizza to live off of for a couple days.  
0	My siblings and I are hungry for some pizza, we don't go out much and with our parent working all the time we never get to go out to eat much. So please if anyone can give us a pizza that would be awesome.
0	Hello, New to site; Really could use a Pizza for self and family; currently unemployed. TORRANCE, California, USA
0	Can someone buy me this : http://www.amazon.com/Maruchan-Ramen-Noodle-Soup-3oz/dp/B001CUGD9Y/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1323107399&amp;sr=8-2  A egift card worth just a dollar more than that would be great! I can have it shipped for free :) . dot edu \m/  Will last a week for me and my 3 y.o. nephew. Me and my nephew stay together, my sister is handicapped, I study at a college in Cambridge. Mom and pop broke. Me no different. I am a waitress at a local restaurant on weekends.   Will pay it forward .
0	Here's a pic of us after making one of our masterpieces :)  [pic](http://audaciousfaith.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/dsc_0072.jpg)
0	My fiance and I are enjoying each other's company before we have to go back to our separate colleges. We would love to split a pizza tonight, but we are very poor college students. 
0	I just got a new job and am still waiting for my first paycheck. but i don't have any food now. my job is at a restaurant but i have three days off in a row. i'm using my free time to provide phone tree legal dispatch for my local OWS protesters. Anybody want to feed a broke worker? 
0	I'm 33 years old and I've been unemployed for 18 months. Most of the new jobs in my hometown of Tullahoma, TN, are far beyond my reach of experience (i.e., medical jobs like registered nurses, etc.). I live with my parents and obviously times have been tough on all of us. My dad works a job he hates but has to stick with it so we can have money to live on;my mom is disabled and can't work. Most of the time we have to rely on local churches to help pay our bills and put gas in our car. While a pizza would definitely raise my spirits it would do the same for my parents. I hate seeing them suffer like this as I get turned down for new jobs. Needless to say times are becoming tougher for my family because the money is running out quickly. So please help me put a smile on my parents' faces for at least one day. That way they know someone out there is watching out for us. :)
1	Getting over a cold would love some comfort food for dinner (pizza?) I've been living on soup for a few days and a change would be nice. I don't have any money coming in this week and I am trying to extend my measly soup and pasta diet till the end.  Thanks guys, this is completely appreciated! Can return the favor when paid.
0	totally craving a stuffed crust, not expecting at all, just would be nice since I am currently unemployed
0	Were a family of 5.We just paid our bills so have no money left but would love to have a family night with my kids. If anyone would help make this happen. I would gladly send pics of us enjoying this pizza or anything else you my like within reason. There is a hungry howies that delivers to our area.thanks so much for reading.
0	Not unusual around here, I take it -- but I'm an unemployed and pretty damned broke college student, and I'd really, really like some pizza while working on my last final projects. Beans and rice just lack a certain something.
0	Hi! I just found this amazing place, and thought I'd give a nice funny title to my post (Although I am an ethnic minority).   Anyways.. I've been sitting at my computer for the past 18 hours studying Calculus and Physics, both are tomorrow and I have a 1 hour drive to school to :( If someone can help a student who has nothing now but will have something later, it'd mean the world!
0	just finished finals and hungry af. just figured i'd give it a shot haha
0	Moved to CA, it's hard out here, looking for work, planning on ramen tomorrow for thanksgiving because it's all I have currently.  Roomate drank all my milk so it's Water for me!  I live with a sociopath downstairs that refuses all human contact, an elderly lady that is the owner of the house is going with family.  I came to the west coast to chase my childhood dream of becoming a Game Designer! I posses a B.S. in game development from brown college in MN where I overpaid for it.  I am currently relying on IT contracts that are very slow coming through and honestly I was not prepared for bus transfers costin $6.00 per ride from here to the nearest metropolitan city.    I know three people out here, the mountains are beautiful, the ocean is breathtaking, and the way people smoke marijuana in the streets free of law enforcement harassment is still a bit of a culture shock for me to see.    I don't expect a pizza, because every post I make on reddit i get a cynical post right away and a dozen downvotes.  but if somebody reads this and knows what it feels like to be alone on thanksgiving i'll feel accomplished i guess.    EDIT: to replace text with "the west coast"
0	I was hoping that my first random act of pizza for myself, but a friend of mine is recently homeless and needs a meal. This being my first request, I really hope it works. I have the address of the hotel in california she is staying at, so I really hope someone can help. I also hope I am doing this right. 
0	We are students struggling to pay rent, and feeling bad eating my girlfriends parents food. It would be awesome to feel like we can relax and just eat some pizza.  If you would like me or my girlfriend to draw you a picture we would be glad to. (She is the better drawer.) if you'd like to see some of her work you can check out her online portfolio [here.](http://www.brookeleighdesign.com/)
0	... So I figured I'd give reddit a shot. I'm currently broke and unemployed, crashing on my buddy's couch. I've got 7 cents in my bank account and 10 cents on my EBT, which won't reload till 8/7. Technically I'm between jobs, waiting on an unpaid PA gig, but they're covering meals, travel, room &amp; board so it's not all bad. Anyway. Pizza, or no pizza, thanks for letting me vent :)
0	StumbleUpon brought me to this: http://randomactsofpizza.com/info.html#started  and that was 4 hours ago. I've been mindlessly browsing this site for 4 whole hours. I don't even NEED StumbleUpon anymore. FOUR HOURS. I'm amazed, and thrilled. I got brave and tried to make a comment, when I realized I hadn't actually created an account yet.  Hopefully I'm doing this right. Just requesting for one. I can share with my kitter. I just need something greasy to console me. I might never leave here. Is there anything I should know in general about Reddit? Obviously, it's a really confusing place.
0	Pretty self explanatory. No sob story ~~and no priding myself on not having a sob story.~~ Embarrassed myself last night and hoping pizza will soothe the pain.
0	Hey, reckon I'd try this. Just looking for my pizza angel! Been running on minimum wage for a while, and really craving some pizza that I can't afford. Promise to pay it forward as soon as I can.  I'm in Murfreesboro, TN. :]
0	Going through a slow separation with my wife (been together for 8 years) and today dad decided to berate me about God and told me I was wasting my time at college and then finished by telling me I was a disappointment. Pizza would help a lot right now.
0	Its raining and they would be stoked!
0	Hi there. Im currently stuck on an Army base and our DEFAC (basically a cafeteria where they serve our meals) is closed. All DEFACs across post are closed. SO, If you would like to order me a pizza, you can rest assured you will have the favor returned on the 1st of August when i get paid. Also a little info on myself, Combat Medic, two years in service, live on Ft Stewart, GA, and Im out of money because I spent it all on my sons birthday when I was on leave last week. Alright thats it, lets hope this works. 
1	My roommate and I have both just moved into a new apartment recently and are hurting financially post-holiday/move. We would love if someone could forward us a pizza- Friday is payday and I will gladly return the favor. We also have a very hungry cat that won't get off my keyboard.  Thanks! We're in Austin, in case you wanted to creep.
0	I applied to work at a photography studio to gain experience outside my chosen field and have a chance to fulfill a dream of mine while making money for school. Didn't have any hope because of no past related history, but received a call 1 hour ago to be told I am a candidate for the second and final interview!   Obviously, as a pay-it-forward, I will fulfill a request as soon as I can afford it.  Thanks guys! 
1	We are completely out of food and have no way of getting anything or any money at the moment and all I have to offer is an Olive Garden gift card. It has $25 on it and I will never use it as we don't live close to one. If anyone can help us out, I will gladly send you my card and I will even send you the info or a picture so you can check the balance on it yourself :) We live right next to Domino's so a ecard for them would be absolutely perfect as we can walk right there and pick it up.   Proof: http://s232.photobucket.com/albums/ee163/marcileigh88/?action=view&amp;current=DSCN0125.jpg  **Edit** A friend helped us out tonight.
0	would love a pizza. pm me if you wanna be kind :D
0	Hi! I just recently moved across the US to Seattle. My previous jobs had always provided me with room and board, but unfortunately it was deducted from our paychecks, not really leaving us with a whole lot left over. I moved to Seattle a month ago, and thankfully have a great group of friends here that are more than generous with their couches until I get up on my feet. I have a job, but not one that can afford me pizza. And I love pizza. Thanks!
0	On my own in student house over the summer - pretty bored and lonely, ran out of money last week and not due any until loan payment in September. Been eating basics from my cupboard for the past few days - I probably won't starve, but a pizza would make such a big difference right now. Won't be able to pay it forward until mid September when I get lots of money, but when I do I will buy a couple if someone helps me out. Thanks for your time reddit. 
0	I just got fired from my job and I'm broke. I don't have any money or food in my house, I've been eating bread and rice all week, and on top of that I signed a NC/NDA where I was fired from and I can't even get another job working on the same type of stuff that I know how to work on (fixing cell phones, computers, and mostly reballing PS3 and XBOX 360s) due to the NC/NDA agreement they had me sign. I'm not sure what to do and I'm really hungry, if someone could please send me something like pizza or foods coupon I would really appreciate it. Thanks
0	Hey Guys. Anyone cares to help me out with a pizza, i am really dying for one right now and i can't really afford it. I study music by the way :-)  
1	My boyfriend, roommate, and I moved into an apartment getting away from our old lives hoping to start a new.  My boyfriend has a felony but the apartment manager was willing to overlook that and let us move in.  Now because another resident found out what he has a felony for and reported it to the corporate office we now have to be out on the 31st.  We've been here less than a month.  With bills getting in the way we have no money for food.  I made the last of our food last night.  I know it is not much but but I have read some of the amazing posts of people finding the kindness in their hearts to give.  When we are forced to move we may not even have a place to go but that's really not the point of this is it?  Anyway I know a pizza won't feed us until the end of the month however it will help.  Any help at all is much appreciated thank you for taking the time to read this!  Edit:  I forgot to put a location I am in Austin Texas thanks Matt_and_Chelle for the reply to remind me!
0	Hey all, I love the stories I read on this subreddit of all you generous people, so here I am throwing myself upon your generosity.  My bank balance is looking decidedly negative, after shelling out money this last week for both my sisters upcoming birthday and mother's day.  About the only food I have at the moment is pasta, which I can eat if necessary, but I really fancy some pizza.  I have both a Dominos and Pizza hut nearby.  Thank you for reading and may your day's be ever full of pizza.
0	Could really go for some cheesy goodness to commemorate this joyous occasion.  Here's proof: http://i.imgur.com/YF7oU.jpg
0	My wife is home with our 20 month old son. We're broke and get paid tomorrow. But this doesnt fix her hunger tonight. Our local pizza places wont deliver if you order online so any order would have to be done by phone. I would greatly appreciate anyone who is able to help tonight. I have 15 bucks in paypal that I can send in return for the ordering and paying for of the pizza. 
0	Greetings. My name is Melanie, and I'm 28 year old fighting Stage 2 Hodgkins Disease. I'm nearing the halfway point in my treatment. I go for chemotherapy every 2 weeks on a Thursday. I spend the weekend sleeping, and my appetite comes back by Monday or Tuesday.  One of the worst sides effects at that point is a nauseous taste in the back of my throat and strong tastes help me cope. Domino's Memphis BBQ Pizza has a strong taste that gives me some relief, and is also the idea balance of high protein/high calorie that my doctors want me to have. I'd really love to have that strong taste when I'm feeling the nausea. This is an ongoing post since every 2 weeks it would be helpful. Thank you for your help. 
0	So I'm sitting in the living room of a lady friend of mine shortly after we have watched the movie Bad Teacher.  We are hungry, but sadly, shortly before I arrived for the movie, the contents of her refridgerator was removed for a little bit of maintnence and de-icing.  The dumpster is full of lost dreams of dinner, that sadly spoiled.  Anyways... I introduced this girl to Reddit tonight, and we happen to be hungry.  After about an hour of laughing our asses off at her reddit innocence, I remembered Random acts of Pizza. We want her first time to be unforgetable and satisfactory. THANKS!
0	My boyfriend and I live in Saint Augustine, Florida and have been having a rough time financially the past few months.  In and out of various jobs, we've had to survive off of coscto sized ramen packs, and pasta and olive oil.  I applied for food stamps a couple days ago, and am waiting to hear back from them.  It's getting a little trite, and we're quite hungry tonight, a hot pizza would be a delight.  We'll happily pay it forward in the future.  Much love.
0	Not trying to give a sob story. Times are rough right now and my mom had some medical issues that I left college to come home to help with. A pizza would brighten both of our days. I'll pay it forward as soon as I can afford to do so.
0	My paycheck for this month is delayed for some unknown reason, and I will probably get my pay in a few days.   It would just make my day a lot better with a pizza while I wait on my pay. The last couple of days have been rough.  Edit. Willing to provide proof of empty bank account if needed.  Post is a day old still haven't recieved my pay so I am pretty hungry :)  Thank your for reading.  
0	I planned to cook myself a nice chicken dinner but I can't bear standing up long enough to cook. Would anyone care to help me out here? It would be greatly appreciated.
0	I am a single mother of a wonderful 9 year old boy. For the past 4 years I worked in group homes assisting individuals with developmental disabilities. I was unfairly terminated from my job and recently had to move in with someone because I couldnt make the rent. I would love to be able to sit down with my son and serve him Pizza for dinner it would be a nice change of pace from the usual mix of ramen noodles and staples that we get with govt. assistance. I will be "Offering" as soon as I get back on my feet..........
0	Hey everyone, i was referred to this site by a dear friend of mine. I am writing because I am requesting dinner for me and my boys tonight. My husband has to work until 11 tonight and i have been sick all day long (pregnant) and honestly dont have the strength to make a meal for my babies. We havent had anything fun for a while because ive had so many complications and this would be a great treat to the boys tonight. They have been so good today with me being sick and I would be so thankful if someone could bless us!  We are located in hinesville, ga. We have a pizza hut, dominoes, papa johns!
1	Hello everyone,  This is my first time here, I have just heard about it and decided to give it a shot since I have little food.  I live in Kent, WA and we just had a really big snowstorm which put my apartment out of power for 5 days, as well as about 400,000 other homes. I have already been struggling and what little food I had frozen has now been spoiled, even the milk in my refridgerator. I live pay check to pay check and I did not anticipate this, I do not even have the money to purchase a gallon of milk.  I was hoping one of the kind souls out there could gift me a pizza that I could enjoy with my son, it would really help so much as all we have is about 6 cup of noodles and 2 boxes of Mac and cheese (with no milk) to make it until payday this Friday.  If somebody could help me out I would be so happy, pizza from anywhere, it doesn't matter... Just something to eat.  I would gladly repay the favor forward when I get paid and gift somebody else in need.  Thank you for listening, Mikey
0	My brother is 18 and im 15, My mom right now is in florida taking a little mental health vacation since shes a teacher, and her students are really huge cunts. I was wondering if one of you guys would buy us dinner, I think it would be a nice surprise for my brother too. Thanks!
0	I just got back to work. My first day was today! I picked my son up a little while ago and have no energy left to cook and I am really hungry. If someone would send a pizza it would mean the world to me and my son. 
0	I've been trying to figure out how to send fellow canadian AridDecay a pizza or two - he posted in r/Assistance looking for help and I wanted to send him a warm treat for halloween.  Unfortunately it seems my plans have fallen through - no one will let me pay with CC online, has to be in person.  If anyone could help him out that'd be super cool. I feel mega-bad at failing. =(
0	EDIT: Will do crazy shit or whatever a soul kind enough to bestow upon me a pizza wishes.
0	I'm house/dog sitting for a friend this week who has no food in his house (except for the dog), and I'm broke until he gets back and pays me.  I'd love to kick back with the pup, a pizza, and some movies tonight, and I fully intend on paying it forward once I get some funds.  Happy Halloween!
0	Lentil soup gets a little old. I grocery shop on a budget of 5 bucks a day. lol
0	Hey guys. Hungry in RI until payday on Friday then putting most of my check into rent and bills. All I've got in the house are some tortillas and a can of Friskies. My furry little friend and I would be much obliged for a pizza dinner (he likes the cheese!) if there's a cool cat out there to donate. One love!
0	Hey All! I've been struggling financially the past month due to some major medical bills. I am a single mom to a 3 yr old son and right now don't have much more than canned vegetables &amp; box of pasta. It would mean so much if I could surprise my son with a pizza as he's been eating the same "create a meal from whatever I have around the house" for the past week. Tonight he asked for something different, I told him we couldn't do it, and I remembered seeing this subreddit awhile back and thought I'd give it a try. I will return the favor as soon as I'm back on my feet financially. Thank you so much!
0	I guess I posted in the "wrong" RAOP...? I don't know...   Either way, just having another rough day, completely broke, somewhat sick (so staving off any doctor visit, no insurance of course), behind on most bills... I'm looking at being caught up within the next two weeks, but today, pizza would soothe my rumbling tummy.   Let me know!
0	I'm 17. and I live in Akron, OH with an angry father, my mother passed away 2 years ago and my siblings have all moved out.    I don't have any money at the moment, which is why I'm here, and I don't have a camera, so I can't document the task I complete unless it involves something in particular that would somehow be accessible.  But I will give you my word that I will do the task, anything for a pizza!
0	I'm a psychology student that is very short on cash, due to an unexpected expense. My mother is on disability and she could not afford her prescriptions. I ended up paying for her prescriptions, which left me very short on cash. I can provide a receipt of the prescriptions for verification, as well as a copy of my bank statement. It was a tough decision to make, but I know I did the right thing. My mother has sacrificed so much in her life for me that I didn't hesitate when she asked me for help.   I will not get paid again until Wednesday of this week, and one pizza can definitely help me make it until then. I have $2.00 left until pay day. I'm hoping that someone will be able to help me. Thank you. 
0	Due to some error at work which was found too late for anything to be done about it, I won't be getting paid until mid January. Naturally as well as all the Christmas expenses, my car decided that this would be a good time to need repair work and everything else, so I'll be spending Christmas here with the dog.  I'm not going to be starving or anything as I do have food in the freezer, but I could really do with a pizza at the moment and it would be very much appreciated!
1	My story can be found here: http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/izeow/iama_man_who_has_lived_in_the_woods_in_a_tent/  Wasn't really looking for handouts or whatever when I posted that, still not really - this subreddit popped up in the sidebar.  I used to do a lot of work in SecondLife, and often I would get people to pay me in pizza.  When I was capable, I gifted people in pizza as well.  I like the idea of sharing a meal rather than being paid directly, seems more friendly.  I'll see what I can do to eventually become a pizza gifter here.  Anyway, if you feel like gifting me a pizza, there is a mom and pop pizza shop I can walk to here you could call and order a pizza directly.  They have a deal mon - wed with a medium one topping for $5.99, or large for like $2 more.  A while back, I had a friend order me a pizza directly with them, no problem.  I'm simple pizza wise - like pepperoni with extra sauce.  I've been living mostly off of ramen (cold-cooked as I have no stove) and dollar menu at McDs, so  pizza would actually be nice.  This is a really cool subreddit.  Hopefully I'll be able to repay the kindness sooner rather than later by passing on a pizza to someone else in need.  I live mid-way down the east coast, and will get more specific when I give whoever the details.  I wasn't asked for the card the time before, I'm thinking an out of state order would be fine.  Wow, if someone does this, thanks so much!  If not, still glad I found this subreddit.  Cool concept - great way to get some actual kharma :D
0	No sob story, no special circumstances. Would just like a pizza tonight instead of boring, cold food.   Will give in return when my pay check arrives at the end of the week!
0	So this isn't quite the usual post but me and my friends broke out the old N64 tonight and were playing some Harvest Moon, we had gotten as far as building the second story to our house when my N64 shut off!! and now it won't even boot back up... we're totally bummed out, and if any of you guys know how we feel, we'd love a pizza right now. Thanks in advance
0	I've been putting a serious dent in my soup cabinet all week. Could really go for Dominos but I can't afford it. Anybody want to make my day?
0	I'm not really in a dire situation or anything at the moment, just mildly depressed at recent life events and waiting around until tonight when my brother (and only roommate) gets home from work and we can go grocery shopping.  Wish my car would get fixed already, so I wouldn't be stranded like this!  Unfortunately, we delayed this food run a little too long, and have run out of basically everything edible besides about a dozen apples and some eggs.  lol.  So yeah, I've been eating nothing but apples since I woke up about four hours ago.  Why are these things so unfulfilling?!  Anyway, I was talking about my situation in an irc channel and someone linked me this.  I've read reddit here and there, but never actually took the initiative to get an account or post anything.  But hey, nothing wrong with giving it a shot I guess.  Not sure what exactly I can give for verification, if you guys would like any.  I assume you would, with me being a newly signed up member.  If you feel like throwing a pick me up my way, just let me know what I can do.  Oh, I should probably note that I live in Vegas.
0	Hi Reddit, my name is jess and i live in dexter, mo. I am new to the site, I was actually referred to this website so I could find some help. I am a mother of two who has been recently laid off so I decided to go to college. Recently my youngest has been having health problems and I wrecked my car. I've never had financial problems before and everything has happened so fast I haven't known what to do. I've got bills stacking up, insufficient funds letters from the bank, disconnect notices left in my door, and thoughts that keep me up all night. Not to mention the constant pain I got from the injuries I sustained in the accident. I've never had to ask for help before, but then again I've never had to worry about how I was going keep food on the table and lights on, its really a terrible feeling. I'm not sure if anyone here will be able to help me or direct me to help  but either way I'm glad I could get all of this out. Thank you.
1	So we're waiting out for some money so we can get moved, but today my husband got his GED after three years! I'm so proud of him and he doesn't think it's anything special, but I want to reward him. Problem is we're pretty tight for cash after enrolling in college [waiting on loans, yay debt!]. If anyone would be so kind, it would really mean a lot to us.  Also just thanks for having such a nice subreddit for people. It's good to know people are getting help. :D
1	My family and friends are away and I'm out of cash to do anything. This would be an awesome present :)  Edit: I'm in NYC
1	Hello, I'm TMHS, a "professional writer." This means I'm constantly broke. I have exactly $2.37 to my name until I hopefully get paid at the end of this week. My pathetic funds aren't even enough to buy my usual staple of poverty pasta from the corner store. I've been living on one meal a day for about a week, and have officially run out of food in my apartment. Its really either this or a condiment medley for dinner, so if you could find it in your heart to help me out, I would really appreciate it.   In return I will write you a personalized short story about any topic of your choosing. It can be funny, sad, sexy, anything you want... maybe a combination of all three? Hmmm?  Thanks in advance Reddit!
0	Hey bros, just wanna buy a $10 pizza and a 24 oz. of something to drink. They serve dinner here at the college pretty early, and the late night pangs just come in hard. Think you could send me about $15 my way?
0	What sounds like a pathetic sob story, is actually true. I was a merchandiser that got laid off from my company on 11/20. So, no money flow. I had three classes I needed to finish to grad with my degree and, like an idiot, I missed my last final and now my teacher has already gone out of the country (she's Indian and won't be back till 2 weeks from today). I can take screen shots to prove all this if you don't believe me. Basically, I'm having a pretty terrible holiday season.  Figured it was worth a shot here to get a pizza to lift my spirits. If you donate, whenever I get a job or take that final, I will send you a pizza AND BREADSTICKS!!@#!@!!! Also, if you want to ask me one question about the moon, I can answer that.  Thanks either way and we should have a jumping high five in 3....2.....1
0	I got no one to blame for my situation but myself. I've been unemployed for a couple of weeks now after quitting my job at the mall over some really petty garbage. I was an idiot for doing it and now I've put myself in a place where I'm sinking fast. I've got no money, bills are okay but that wont last long, and I've got almost nothing in the way of food. My family doesn't speak to me anymore because I came out two years ago, so I can't fall back on them. I don't even know where my brother moved to last year, he didn't tell me before he left.   I go to to school full time at BCC and without income the gas money getting to the campus in downtown Ft Lauderdale three days a week is killing me. I have interviews lined up but there's no telling how long it will be before I get another check. I'm really ashamed of myself for thinking I could just quit and find a new job overnight. I haven't told any of my friends yet but I'm going to have to if nothing changes for me. The sooner the better I know, but I'm just terrified of telling them how badly I'm doing right now.   I'm asking for a handout in a big way because I've got nothing going for me right now. Even my grades aren't that great this semester. Can anyone on here help me this one time?
0	Looking for some pizza to help me with my cash issues. With the amount of time i have to dedicate to 4th year studies, i have been unable to find a job and am now literally paying for it. 
0	Hello everyone. I just heard about this site through one of my friends. I have been struggling with my finances as I am a newly single mom, I have a 10 month old daughter. My friend told me about this site, and said that she had received a pizza when she was in need, and that it really helped her. I figured I would give it a try. I know I just registered on Reddit, and that many people will see that as a bad thing, but i'll do anything to prove that i'm real.  My husband and I just got a divorce. My daughter and I moved into our own apartment, and I am trying to get back on my feet. I am in the midst of getting things in order with Job and Family Services, but until then i'm broke.  So, if anyone can help, that would be great! When I get back on my feet, I will surely pay it forward.
0	As the title mentions. I'm broke and unemployed, haven't been able to find a job for about 4 months now due to my location in a small rural Nevada town. Jobs are scarce right now. I've been drooling over the selection on Pizza Hut for about an hour now. Stuffed Crust pizzas from Pizza Hut have always been my favorite. Anyone out there who could help me out? One small catch: I don't have a car so it would have to be delivered.
0	I am retired army and a disabled veteran and I also have a cleaning business. Right now contracts are very low and so my income has dropped. The cost of the business has started eating into my personal funds and until contracts increase I'm living day to day. I have 1 bag of beans left on the shelf and the food pantry is closed for the weekend as a matter of fact it's closed Monday also. I work hard and that won't stop because I enjoy what I do, I'm just stuck and asking for a little help to keep my family fed and I hope to be able to help someone else in the future :) 
1	I hope I'm doing this right, it feels really weird asking for something, but it would really make me feel better. I'm in university and I'm really broke, my rent and groceries cleaned me out earlier this week and last night my freezer turned off and spoiled all of my newly bought groceries. I tried to make pizza for lunch with toast and tomato sauce but it turned out pretty shitty.  ++Warning, the link has very loud background music, turn speakers down++ [This](http://www.twicethedealpizza.com) is where my room-mates and I normally get our pizza since it's the cheapest place in town, we normally get the "Godzilla deal" two XL pizzas with 3 toppings for 20 bucks and normally get onions, tomatoes and bacon.   Thank you so much, as soon as my next paycheck comes in someone can expect to be getting some pizza. Reddit is awesome no matter what Anderson Cooper says. 
0	Just had to throw down some hefty change on the rent bill and now I'm really hungry. Anyone out there care to help me out?
0	You can tell me what to draw, or I will simply draw a picture of us enjoying the pizza:) We could defiantly use some help right now.
0	Rent is due tomorrow morning so I'm short on cash. All I have is some frozen chicken and rice but I'm about to begin working on a paper, a prelab, and study for a midterm. I just got back from football practice(I work for the team, UMD TERPS!)  I would love to have a pizza to get me through all this work I have to do.  THanks!
0	I've been stuck at home unable to go to work for the past few days because I've been.without gas money and no one to carpool with and little money for food til my next paycheck on Tuesday. I would even be willing to repay the deed once I get my paycheck, but am Shit out of luck currently.
0	Hey, I could really use a pizza.
1	He moved from Indiana to Flagstaff, AZ about two weeks ago, however while driving down to Flagstaff, his car broke down about 100 miles outside of town. So he had to spend all of his money on towing and repairs. He told me yesterday he has never been more hungry in his life and that things aren't going very well for him. Unfortunately, I don't have money to send him an e-card, but I figure some good hearted person on randomactsofpizza (didn't have any luck on the other randomactsofpizza) can help him out. Message me and I will provide his e-mail address for you! Also please pay no mind to my ironically named account, I made it two years ago! I will be very grateful for your kindness and he most certainly will as well!
0	This is me http://imgur.com/gallery/P8q3D  I tried to come up with the money to go here: http://imgur.com/gallery/FgNwa But if a fellow http://imgur.com/gallery/OdEpK (redditor) bought me something similar to this http://imgur.com/gallery/Kiiz1 then I would be very happy, and have a full tummy tonight. EDIT: this took a while for me to do, so have a heart!!! [reddit!](http://reddit.com)  
0	I just moved got a place with my friend! Excited but at the same time it doesn't leave much in the bank if you know what I mean. Its been the first of the month and we have budgeted well and used our resources sparingly. It is now almost near the end of our journey and we find our selves on the couch wondering how many cup of noodles have we eaten? Frankly, I can stick it out and so can my friend.... but it would be awesome to eat something that's not SOUP! :) me and my friend would appreciate anything
0	So it turns out a Journalism course needs good grades in English, who knew!
0	Student in a lot of debt, would prefer not to add another $10 for pizza to that pile. I just have 1 more month to go until I can defend my thesis... I've written 200 pages and have about 50 more to go. Once I defend and get a job, I'll become a pizza-giver: I'll give out 2 pizzas for every pizza I've gotten as a student!
0	Hey! Recently got laid off, and roommate gets paid Friday. Pretty much stuck on ramen at the moment... A pizza would be a blessing!
0	Hi there, i'm in a spot of bother and my girlfriend just left me for a good friend of mine. I feel like utter crap cos i spent all my money on her. i am new here but could really do with some help plus its my birthday soon :). thanks, Dan
1	Broke until payday and only have soup waiting for me at home, but I am craving some cheesy goodness! If anyone could help, that would be gnarly!
0	My parents died when I was young and I have been living in fostercare since I was 6, I now work 3 jobs just to make ends meet. I am really hoping someone kind will spare some american pesos and spare a girl a pizza  love  Sammy 20/f/MA
0	Bad night last night led to a break up with my, now ex, girlfriend.  Been with her for 3.5 years.  Feeling really down and would love somebody to make me feel better.  First time posting here.  Let's see what happens.  In Richmond, VA.
0	I get paid once a month and I've just had a lot of unexpected surprises come forward. I'm in Austin, TX and just looking for something tonight. As stated, in exchange I will buy a pizza + extra appetizers or what have you next week as a token of thanks. I'd greatly appreciate it. I even tried rounding up pesos for pizza patron but mine are all Chilean :(  I'll answer any other questions or offer proof if you need.  
0	I have no real need for pizza, except for the fact I'd like some for lunch. Lunch is at 3PM today. Help turn a craptastic day into an pizzatastic day :D
0	New To this. I just found this off WUAH. SO hopefully this will work? Due to finaces things are tight. I promise to return a favor when i can.! thank you and hope everyone has a great day!!! 
1	**UPDATE: Pizza received and VERY much enjoyed. Thank you so much, Coldheat!**  It's been a long long road to hunger, money's been tight for a few months and we finally hit a wall. Out of Ramen, out of leftover Manwich, even the ice cubes have been vanquished. We have quite the family to feed with two [Guinea](http://i.imgur.com/RIwMP.jpg) [Pigs](http://i.imgur.com/TOBup.jpg) and our beloved [King](http://i.imgur.com/FlkmM.jpg) [Keith](http://i.imgur.com/I3tjM.jpg), and their food took priority this week :/ Will GLADLY repay the tasty favor (to you or another in need) in a few weeks when money gets back on track.    We're barely 200 pounds put together and a $10 large would feed us for days.    **TL;DR: Broke couple with well-fed pets needs some pizza in a pinch.**    EDIT: Third shifters, it is nearing bedtime.
0	I have this week alone to make up all the work I have missed. I have just lost one of my cats to liver disease and I miss him alot. He was only 2 years old. Midterms are next week and I have to study along with getting my work in. A redditor giving me a pizza will make my week and make me work even harder. I will also take requests for things to do in return. Thank you! (I live in Ypsilanti, Michigan)
0	So I'm hungry and kinda sad over the death of my grandmother and I couldn't go to the funeral due to her being in England and there is no way I could make it over their from the US. If you want the beta key just PM me. You owe me nothing for it as long as you enjoy it.
0	27 year old Air Force guy with a wife and 5 month old daughter. Bills came and took us from underneath. Will pay it forward as soon as I can.
0	Just started a new job but all my remaining money was put into my gas tank. Just need some food to get me through until payday. You would be helping out a military member in need. =) Please and thank you!
1	Unemployed and broke future soldier and his wife. Out of food and could use some help, will gladly pay it forward come January when I ship. Thank you.
0	Living around Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Going out with my girlfriend, coming home to some pizza would be a dream. 
0	Well like the title says, just basically looking for an angel, somebody to guide me, a big brother or just simply a break. I'm 18 going into my 2nd year of college and on the top ramen diet. I am broke, I got less a dollar in my bank account. Books have taken the most of $ and I have been applying for jobs but it has not been easy. If you can find it in your heart to simply give someone a break. Please it would be great. I promise to pass it on when I get my loans in.
1	I've been living on starvation rations for a week; I was determined to treat myself to pizza for my birthday but the friend who owes me money let me down again...   Any kind-hearted redditors out there wanna give me a present? Much love and virtual hugs will be dispatched via the tubes.  Swindon, UK  EDIT: It is no longer my birthday so I humbly withdraw my request. Thankyou anyway RAoP.
0	lost my graphic design job. absolute fucking dream job, gone. idk how long it'll take me to find a new position, but i hope sooner than later. dude i'd be so ecstatic if someone can hook me up with a pie. long time lurker - first time poster. i read the sidebar, i have verification and i am located in PA. please and thank you
0	My two boys entered first grade and pre-K today and I'd like to get them a special dinner tonight but my wife and I are broke. Anyone willing to save them from Mac &amp; Cheese?
0	I'm hanging out with my friends and we are about the watch a Batman movie marathon before we go see the Dark Night Rises again tomorrow. But my parents left me without any food in my house. I've given them drinks, but i assume we are going to get pretty hungry soon.  I'll draw a picture of batman as a reward! Thanks.
0	Hey all,  title pretty much explains it.  My first paycheck isn't until thursday so I'm broke and hungry until then. When I do get paid you can count on me to pay it forward. Thanks :) 
1	Hello friends!  I just got back from classes and I really don't feel like cooking tonight.  I was going to order a Papa Johns pizza but I just bought gas and can't really afford it right now.  Would anyone be so kind?  I have a gift-able copy of portal on steam if some kind individual would like it :)  Also I'm fairly new (previous lurker) to reddit and I heard about RAOP, you folks are doing FSM's work.
0	My hard working dad works as a wholesale selling electronics in NY and business is slow lately and he isn't making money like he used to. My mother is a stay-at-home mother who has never had a job in her life and our family has a very tight budget. While some people may say to get off yar lazy arse and get a job, quite frankly in my situation its impossible as of right now. I'm too busy to get a job again to maintain my grades and enough sleep each night so that option is out of the picture.  All I'm asking for is a simple medium/large pizza, that's all, it would really make my day for a stranger on the internet to perform such an act of kindness.
0	I am super embarrassed but I wouldn't mind some pizza. I will pay it forward when my check gets here in the mail!  
0	20 years old and I've been unemployed since I finished a 6 month contract in March, and I'm living in my parents' loft. I buy all my own food and pay the very little rent that I can out of my Jobseekers' Allowance, and afterwards have maybe Â£10-20 a week to do what I like with (including putting money towards my damned Â£35/month phone bill that I'm locked into 'til August). But hey, it's had an accidental benefit of forcing me to cut down on smoking, 'cos that's just too damn expensive.  I had an interview and a whole bunch of assessments for a great job last week and absolutely aced it. I personally thought I had the job in the bag, and at the very end of the interview I asked when I'd be hearing from them - they told me I'd know today, and then said they've got a few more interviews to do first for *in-house applicants*. Gulped, but whatever. Got to today, and I've sat there next to my phone and checking my emails feverishly. It's now 9PM and I've had no call. So here's to more unemployment.  And frankly, I'm getting sick of cheap noodles and various soups and could do with something nice so I can play Deus Ex and feel at least a little better for tonight before I keep on applying everywhere and wait for my lucky break so that I can tell other people that a situation like this doesn't last forever.  Thanks, Reddit (:
1	basically, as the title indicates, I am bored of studying/waiting to fail my finals and am super hungry.  If anyone has a request, I will take a picture of myself fulfilling that request in exchange for pizza.
0	Hey all, I have been a lurker for awhile now but decided to see if I could get a little help. My previous employer down-sized recently and fired many employees including me. I am a single mother with three children. I have no savings and have been able to support my childrens lives and my own from paycheck to paycheck. If anyone would be kind enough to help out with a gift card or anything, I would greatly appreciate it. It will help us more than you know.
0	[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/CKvGE)  I never thought I would be in this position, I usually tough out times like these when money is scarce and survive on Ramen and bread.  Alas I don't even have money for that.  Due to my hours at work getting cut (I make minimum wage at a bowling alley) and just having paid rent I'm looking at 2 weeks with no food or Ramen if I'm luckily enough to find some change in the parking lot at work.    How did I get into this position one might ask, well here is a brief backstory.  I moved out here to Arizona from Ohio to try and get clean from a 7 year hardcore heroin addiction that cost me my own business (I used to own a pizza shop ironically) my girlfriend her life (She overdosed and died in bed next to me last year) and of course I couldn't pay for school while still on drugs and found myself on the streets.  I've worked so hard to finally get a job, albeit its meager and they are doing everything in their power to keep payroll costs as low as possible, and stay clean.  Due to the state being broke I don't qualify for food stamps since I can afford my rent ( although BARELY) that seems to be the biggest deciding factor on whether or not I can get assistance.  I don't have any family as both my father and mother have passed away and both were adopted and had no siblings.  I just don't know what to do and am beyond depressed and fed up with life.  I work so hard and I can't even afford to feed my dog, let alone myself.  I just can't take it anymore, so I finally decided to actually ask reddit for help.  I would give anything just to not be hungry for one night.  If anybody out there is feeling generous, I don't know what I can do in return other than thank you daily for the next few months straight.    About to give up on life,  Publius0  (Yes I could sell my computer, but its worth MAYBE $25-50 at a pawn shop if they would even take a 11 year old dell with a cracked screen, taped together powercord and missing keys :/)
1	Hey RAoP....it's a few days before payday and I'm broke. The wife and I recently got married and I've been outfitting the apartment with what we need...she just got a job a few weeks ago and we haven't really splurged on anything.   Would love some pizza. 
1	I am always working, and my eldest (who is 16) helps take care of the house and other two kids while I am at work. Tonight, I would like to treat them to a nice pizza and wings dinner, but I have no money. Please help.  P.S. Dominos is their favorite 
0	I live in Nanaimo BC Canada. And I am really craving pizza.. I will return the love next friday night (payday)
1	Hello! I haven't had any pizza in a while, due to being extremely tight on funds. My dream is to have a slice to remind myself of the better things in life. I'm not sure what I can do to receive pizza, but I'm open to suggestions! Thanks again.
0	Long story short, somehow paypal repeated the same transactions until all my money in both my checking and savings accounts were gone. Got a call at work from my bank saying that i had no money and i need to pay for the overdraft charges. Taking 4 hours of paper work, they told me that it will take 3 - 4 weeks to get my money back, if I get it back. My paycheck went directly to my bank account which was taken. I have 4 dollars cash to last me 3 -4 weeks...
0	Unexpected dental work has tightened our family of four's budget this week and there's not much left to buy groceries. If anyone could spare a pizza, we would greatly appreciate it.  Forgot to add location to the thread title: Central Ohio
0	Pretty straight forward, I'm not a struggling individual, however I have been inconvenienced by someone's criminal theft of my card information on a holiday weekend. 
0	im looking to get some help! my oldest just got his very first 100 on his spelling test (he has dyslexia) so this is a big deal!!! My other to have been very understanding and helpful taking care of their younger brother (hes 2) who is sick with a cold!! Id love to get them some pizza but I am broke until Friday when I get pd!! Can anyone help?? We have a dominos here locally for delivery...I even have a verification code if someone tells me how it works! 
0	There's not a could in the sky, and after a walk earlier I feel at peace with the world, rather than thinking of bills, loans and debt, for once. Nothing I'd rather be doing right now than on reddit!   Based near Albany, NY  I have a verification code. 
0	CAN WE STILL CELEBRATE WITH A PIZZA???
0	Hello, Pizza Gods? Are you there? It's me, OmNomdePlum.  I am but a humble tall ship sailor, which as you well know, in this day in age means I've taken vows of voluntary poverty. Teaching children how to sail an 18th century ship is well and good - however there's a point where one realizes that it's not paying the bills.   So, having recently returned from life on the high seas, I find myself working my arse off to pay the sudden onslaught of bills that I've returned to, which leaves little for food stuffs. I've applied for work at the Seattle Art Museum (they have some awesome exhibitions coming in), but should I get this job, I won't see positive pay off well into next month.   Thus, Pizza Gods.. here I am, a sailor with a roof, but no nom'ibles. Please, if it is within your power to do so, send me a sign - an omen of good will that will get me through the night, and hopefully tomorrow - I'll find out if I get that job tomorrow or not.  In the name of the Godfather, the Caesar &amp; the long lost, but not forgotten Domino mascot, I pray.   Amen. 
0	I found out a couple weeks ago that I have Rheumatoid Arthritis. While I wait to start serious treatment, I'm having to give up just about every focal activity in my life- basketball, yoga, alcohol and long nights out. This is making my move to a new city all the more difficult, as you might imagine. Anyway, I'm hungry, low on food, and too achy to shop and prepare a meal (no real grip function today). I figured it would be worth a shot since I'm just a couple days away from returning the gesture.
0	Hello I  am a 20 year old male living far away from away from all family. My car was towed twice this month, thoroughly draining my account and rent money. And to top it off, now my car won't even start and my foodstamps were unexpectedly cut off :/ Things are rough and I humbly ask for my favorite food, Pizza Hut. Id love to share a pie with my friends this week, theyve helped me so much and i wanna show them I appreciate them. :)
0	Since bank of america is bad at being a bank, they canceled my old debit card without sending me a new one because they may or may not have leaked some information regarding my account. So now here I am left without any means of acquiring food for the next couple days and a pizza pie would be really nice. 
0	Being a girl isn't fun sometimes. I need pizza.
0	My girlfriend and I (both senior year design students) have been busting our butts in the studio working on our respective theses.  Can't leave the studio, would love to have a hot one delivered.  -Philadelphia
0	Been donating plasma twice a week for extra cash. Couldn't donate on Tuesday because the nurse fucked up my left arm on Saturday, and I was told I would need BOTH arms available to donate. So they sent me home. I can't go back until the blood on the surface of my skin disperses. A pizza would really help out for Thursday and Friday, if someone would be kind enough. It's not much, but I could repay you with reddit gold upon my next donation.
0	Studying for physiology and anatomy -_- fuck my life.. honolulu
0	Let me start off by saying that I've read some of the posts here a few times and have always wanted to give someone a pizza.   I lost my job over 4 months ago, right before my wedding. We had an idea that it was going to happen so we saved up some money. Our savings and my wife's job have been enough to pay the bills for the last 4 months. But that money has run out.   Last week I was lucky enough to find a part time job but I haven't started it yet. My wife and I have no money right now and have been eating hot dogs and ramen for the last week (seriously, 7 days). We could both really go for not-a-hot-dog for dinner.  Thanks for everything RAOP!  **EDIT** I Should say that I'm in Upstate NY.
1	EDIT: Thanks DelicateCrush, I am very thankful. :)
0	I got an inner ear infection three weeks ago, and the vertigo is bad enough that I can't work. I'm a college student and I'm quickly running out of Ramen, hoping I can get to work again before the rent is due. If someone wants to send me a pizza or come hang out (Bozeman, MT) that would be awesome!
0	Hey y'all, I'm pretty hungry and have to wait until tomorrow night for any money. I will draw you [well more like a sketch] anything, for some pizza. Plus I will be paying it forward tomorrow, double time, or maybe three times. (Most likely thrice!)  **EDIT:** Hey y'all never mind, you may ignore this post now, feel welcomed to request a drawing though, no pizza needed :)
0	am i doing it right?
0	I'm a U.S. history major that would love a pizza to help get me through this long day of studying ahead. 
0	We're having some financial issues, and we'd rather any extra money go towards the baby, but man, we are dying for a good pie. 
0	Hey Pizza people, I've just finished making sure that my neighborhood is ready for the upcoming hurricane, but in doing so, I had to spend my paycheck on supplies and such, so I'm looking for the kindness of one person to send a pizza and I'll be eternally grateful and I'll repay it back later. :)  Much thanks and here's hoping everything will work out!
1	The title pretty much says it all;  I'm working on my last semester in uni, been surviving off rice, coffee, and free food samples on campus for the last month.  Wouldn't mind a delicious pie to satiate my taste buds.   Thanks for reading :)
0	Hey guys! First time requester...Long story short, my job hates me and my roomies are asshats. Can anyone suggest a great way to end the evening?
0	My best friend and I share a one room apartment and for the last two months have only been able to afford ramen, if we're lucky. Neither of us get help from our families and we finally both may have gotten  jobs! (i'm going to my interview in about an hour) We would be eternally grateful and would love to celebrate with some pizza!  
0	No food in my house and I have to go to swimming in 3 hours.. a pizza would really be awesome! I'll pay it forward someday :)
0	In addition to that, I've been wondering for a while how this works. Figured my birthday might be a good a time as any to try it. I'll be sure to pay it forward though!  PS: I can also write poetry if someone is interested. Or music. 
0	My little brother and I have nothing to eat and it looks like it's going to be that way until tomorrow. Any help would be appreciated greatly.
1	I'm running out of money, so is my girlfriend, lots of stress over whether she'll be forced to drop out of college or not over parents unpaid taxes. Feels bad, man. I'm also running out of card swipes for dining hall food, and won't have enough to eat throughout finals. Pizza would be appreciated, and we'll send you an artsy photo of a building on campus. I also give the solemn promise to donate back to the community by buying someone pizza with my first summer paycheck. EDIT: Feeling like an idiot: Greeley, Colorado.
1	Hi there, this is my first request. It's 12:39 local time, and I'm looking at a long night. I have a job that pays monthly, and I receive my first check in about a week. Until then I am completely broke. Thanks!!
1	All I have to get me through until Friday is a few packs of ramen and oatmeal. First time in this Sub-Reddit thought I would give it a try.
0	If possible I'd like papa johns so I can couple it with their current promo of buy a pizza get one free tomorrow. Thanks in advance. :D
0	Nothing really big going on for Me, just don't have the cash for any pizza right now and I'm craving it. I will pass along the favor when I can afford it. Thanks reddit!
1	I try not to resort to asking people for help, but I can't stand ramen anymore...   I am trying to learn photoshop, so I can try to do some small tasks to pay you back.  
1	Haven't eaten anything besides Cheerios and ramen noodles for the past week. Would appreciate some Dominos cheesy goodness. Thanks for looking!
0	Been roaming around on this subreddit for awhile but didn't have any need to post. I'm not in any dire situation but wanted to see if anyone was feeling generous tonight. I go to Ohio State, living right off of campus, and just haven't had time to get out to the grocery store this week. If anyone out there could help me out just for tonight it would make my night. Thanks for taking the time to read, love what this place is about.         
0	dear seattlites, and even those who live far away, I ask you just for one second of your time. I swear it wont take long, and I swear I wont ask much. All I'm pleading with you for, is a nice hot vegetable/meat covered sweet sensation bringing belly filling pizza pie. We are a house of 4 friends who due to unlucky circumstances have found ourselves jobless and on the verge of losing our home. This is all we ask, is for some food for our stomachs so we may have energy when setting out on our quest and turning in resumes. Our sweet loving dog Oliver has begun to suffer as we have resorted to eating his dog food and his supply is slowly dwindling. Please dearest humans with money in your pockets, dearest humans with food on your table, share your wealth and increase our health. Love surely, the inhabitants of the house on the corner.
0	My school bizarrely sets meal times to end at 7 pm every night, and as a twenty year old I often stay up about 7 hours after that. As a twenty year old I also get extremely hungry and have no money with which to get a pizza. If anyone would be so kind as to offer me this, I would definitely pay it forward in the future. Definitely not a tearjerker, but 100% factual
0	I've got a guitar in one hand and the other is a pizza pie?
1	Vermont  So I've never posted here, and I feel like I'm begging so I need to level and say that I do have food in the house. I just haven't had much of anything besides pasta and ground beef for a few weeks (the ground beef ran out a few days ago, so I'm kind of stuck with just pasta for the next few days, until I receive my check in the mail.)  Figured I'd test my luck and see if I can't switch it up and have some pizza this afternoon. If anyone might be up for the favor you can send me a pm.  edit: Pizza received! Thanks a bunch.
1	I posted a request already but basically, I have some food here at home but can't afford to go buy anything and my boyfriend and his girls and I are all craving pizza quite a bit.   (I can provide proof if need be)  Thought I would give this a try and and hopefully recieve a pizza! I solemnly swear to offer pizza in a couple weeks :)   Thanks!
0	well, My mom is out of town and wont be back for a few more days. . . I had quite a bit of cereals and breads and various boxed foods to last me, and 5 days ago EVERYTHING Got completely infested with bugs.  all the food was pretty much garbage and not safe to eat and I had to get a friend to come help me throw everything out and spray the house down and try to kill all these fuckers off...  but now I have no food, and no money (Bank account is -7328 overdrafted D: ) and I haven't eaten in days. . .  Any generosity would be nice. doesn't even have to be a pizza. Any food delivered would be nice... I'm in canada. I know most food places have cheap salads and various other things.. Anything would be appreciated and i promise to pay it forward as soon as I have money to do so or the chance to! D: ... thanks for your time...
0	I turned 25 today! Looking for some nice birthday pizza for my family. Were staying in chicago tonight at my sisters apartment and would love some pies. :) there are nine of us, but even one pizza would be nice.  Thanks in advance- verification can be provided if needed.
1	Hey guys, I was just in the r/assistance part of reddit and was linked to this subreddit. I dont really know how this works as it is my first time, but i'm hungry. I can give you the long story, but we all have ours. Basically im so broke its sad. I live paycheck to paycheck and I have overstretched myself this week and im hungry. I have rice, but 3 days of rice and even the most desperate of people will grow tired of it. (I also have been eating it plain due to no soysauce) :/  If anyone could send me a pizza I would be more grateful than I can express. I can pay it back as well, but not until next friday when I get paid.   thanks
0	For the past 6 days I have been in Kansas City, MO visiting family. I just arrived back at logan airport about two hours ago. There's nothing in the house because i have yet to be able to go out. Its been a long day and pizza would be nice:)
0	Hiya~  This isn't my main account, but I have some friends from real-life who know my main, and I want to keep this private. I'm using an old throwaway, as I figured it might help to prove a little bit that I really *am* an active reditor. (Promise! :3) I used this throwaway to publish a story to /r/nosleep that got a fair amount of attention. (Check it out if you're interested.)  Anyway, I was recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder, and I've been feeling like absolute shit for the past week, and my family doesn't even get it. They just say that I'm screwing up and I feel like I can't take it anymore. (â¥ï¹â¥)  Some comfort food would be really nice, if some kind person (â¥\^.\^â¤) might be willing to buy me a pizza, to go along with my movie. I'll even write you a story about something you choose, if you want.  Thanks!~  **EDIT**: Oh, and fyi, I've never received pizza on my main account either. O.O
0	I'm not poor or anything. I just really love pizza..... A lot. LOL.
0	**CLOSED - FOUND HOT DOGS IN FREEZER**  My aunt is having problems with her husband(possibly getting a divorce) and had to get out of the house. It is my understanding he has been hiding money from her and only giving her enough to pay the bills leaving nearly nothing for her and their five kids.  I would buy the pizza myself buy I am unemployed. If someone would be kind enough to buy us some food I am sure we all would appreciate it.  Location: Central California
0	Hey guys! I am located in Dublin, Ireland and am so hungry! I haven't eaten anything for about 10 days because I am on exchange for school and have run out of money! Can't eat again until Dec. 16th when my mom gets paid and can send me some money! Would absolutely pay it forward once I have the funds to do so :) 
0	I've been really craving a pizza.  Don't have the money, and that's a story for another day.  Today's story is this.  I have four general admission lawn seats to the Rockstar Enery Mayhem festival featuring Disturbed, Godsmack, and Megadeth.  The show is today in West Palm Beach at the Cruzan Amphitheater.  I'm trying to give them away.  If someone wants to throw a pizza my way, that's awesome.  If not, that's cool too.  Would love to be able to give back to someone who has been helping others, so verified givers will be given preference.  Obviously this is short notice, but they are electronic tickets and I will send them to you right away.    Hope someone can use them.  
0	I went out friday night for Star Trek trivia (which I lost) and I must have lost my debit card somewhere from the trivia event to my house.  I didn't leave the house at all yesterday as I had no need to since I had enough food to make myself dinner Saturday night when the intention of going grocery shopping today...however My Debit card is gone.  I've searched everywhere and it's gone.  This wouldn't be bad if my bank were open on a sunday but alas it is not.  Since I have nothing to eat today I figured I've give it a shot and ask another redditor for some help .  I can pay you back or pay it forward as early as tomorrow as soon as I can get to a bank and get a new card.  Thanks!
0	Hope this isn't too edgy for this subreddit- don't want to offend anyone.  Hello awesome and generous Redditors of Randoms Acts of Pizza!   You may have heard of (or are perhaps participating yourself!) [NaNoWriMo](http://www.nanowrimo.org/) 30 days of literary abandon!  I am currently attempting to log my sexual memoirs during this event as a writing experiment for myself.  I am home pounding away at the keys trying to catch up and reach my word count goals and recall details that have escaped me in moments of passion ; )  I'm home with the SO and we are both very hungry and equally broke doing the starving artist/starving writer thing.  Anyone who can relate to this situation and is in a position to help us out with dinner would be our hero!!  I would love to share the fruits of my labor from this evenings writing with whoever helps me out.  If you are intrigued to read it, I will send you a private work in progress vignette from my pizza nourished efforts!  
1	Hey guys, I've been living off of protein shakes and cereal these past few days because I can't really afford to buy anything yet, and I've just about run out of anything. The few leftover dollars I did have went towards food for my gerbils. If anyone could help me out with some food for tonight that would be great. I just have to wait one more day and I'll have some income coming in, I'll be able to help anyone in need tomorrow :] edit: Pizza is on the way, thanks to you.
0	studying for several hours for Environmental Geochemistry tonight Invertebrate Zoology tomorrow night and Geographic information systems Thursday night   we are all poor college students (depending on the time between 3-6 of us) anything would be amazing.   i brought Reddit joy once with this post http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/m659k/so_i_was_at_the_gym_and_i_was_thinking/ which made it to the front page, i would be awesome if we got pizza. 
0	Probably a long shot. But I worked a long 10 hour shift and came home to an empty refrigerator. I can pay you back Tuesday. I can give you bank statements and my phone number.
0	Hello!!!   I've heard great things about this subreddit and was hoping someone would help me out.   Had my hours cut at work, got paid last week only to spend it all by sunday catching up on bills.  Had to pay for car insurance or else my license would have been suspended ( almost reached day 30)  because I wasn't made aware I lost my insurance ( parents always took care of it). And Now the car's engine won't even kick over.   Stomach is growling and I have nothing but dry cereal ( which is something some people can't say I know. )  So I'm hoping one of you kind people will help me fill my belly.   I promise to pay it forward x2 this pay check (1st of February) and will make sure my benefactor receives confirmation if desired.   Please and Thank you you magnificent internet type people.   ~TD   Edit- An Empty Wallet :( 
0	I'm a student it's my first day back and I'm broke I'm in the uk can I get a pizza?  haven't heard of this site before but i'm starving and i've run out of food in my house, don't know how this works so if someone could help out i'll love you forever and possibly name my first born after you
0	Thank you so much, candreacchio, for coming through for us! It's late here, but I will order tomorrow and update with a pic!
0	I don't want to get into my whole sob story, let's just say times have been stressful and tough. Been having a hard time just keeping the utilities on.  I love the fact that food pantries exist, otherwise I'd have to be living off of government food programs, which I'd rather not use since there are much needier people, but after awhile canned foods and dried beans get really old really fast.  It would really make my month to have someone actually pay for a pizza for me. It seems unreal that someone would do this. Here's hoping.
0	I'm starving, but only have $40 bucks in my account which I'm saving to use to take my lady this weekend to celebrate her College graduation. I would really appreciate a pizza right now! Thank you.
1	fridge is looking pretty fucking shabby, will prove. I was fucked by a previous employer out of $3,000, now broke as shit with little food until at least Monday when i have a phone interview for food stamps but i've been denied before because of my past drug related crimes and how California laws are. You can rape and murder someone in California, get out of prison, and get food stamps, but you're fucked if you sell someone weed once. I know that won't get me much pity but I could really care less about that, i just want pizza and i heard this was the place for that......
0	Working on finishing my final projects in two classes. And I'm out of cash would love some late night pizza.
0	~~I lost my job today after being really sick for a couple of days. I tried to make bean burritos tonight, but after hours of cooking, the beans are still hard! I'm very hungry but very broke. Any kindness would be greatly appreciated.~~  Upon researching our scenario, I remembered a recent credit card bill I paid a bit of. Thankfully, we'll be able to afford our food for the night. We (Necrizzo and his g/f) can thankfully splurge on some 'za for ourselves tonight.
0	I work 6 sometimes 7 days a week as a waitress to pay my bills, and live on my own. Was going to go shopping for food today (Which is why I even had all my money/tips on me to begin with....) when some older scruffy guy shoved me to the ground, and stole my purse :( I can get some tips working the day after 2morrow (imagine that, tomorrow is my first day off in 10days *sigh*), and buy food, but I'm really kinda hungry tonight.
0	A recent college grad with a minimum wage job. Needless to say, I'm busy paying back student loans and just don't have extra cash for something like a pizza. My fridge is rather sparse, so I was hoping for something I could eat for dinner, it'd be much appreciated!
1	Title pretty much says it all. No sob story, would simply love a pizza to help me through today!
0	Hi RAOP, my car brokedown over the weekend and it will be fixed tomorrow but I can't buy groceries till payday. Luckily thanksgiving is this week so the leftovers i can get from both sides of my family will hold me over until then so anything could help between tonight and turkey day. Its just me by myself so 2 pizzas max would do.
0	I have not eaten for 9 hours i need some food. preferably a meat lovers lol. c: 
0	I will pay it forward as soon as I get paid, as this subreddit has helped renew my faith in humanity.  I'm one of those college grads (Master's degree) with a massive amount of debt working in a soul-sucking non-related field, and have not budgeted enough for food this month. I get paid on Friday, but would love a good pizza tonight, and low and behold my funds won't allow for it. So, any help would be so much appreciated. 
0	I get paid Wednesday, but ran out of food yesterday.  I'm not sure exactly how this works, but I figured I'd give it a try because, well, I'm getting pretty hungry.  It doesn't have to be much, but I would really appreciate a little help to get me through until Wednesday.  Thank you.
0	Here's the dealio. Me, my girlfriend, and my housemate are really hungry for pizza (and love). There's nothing in the house but chili and it's really hot so chili is utterly unappealing. Who wants to help out 3 random college kids? Please and thanks. Much love.
0	Just moved to the city from Austin, TX. Haven't started work yet, willing to illustrate for pizza.  Examples of my work: http://www.seanmatthewleary.com/Site/Portfolio/Pages/Illustration.html 
0	So, I'm stuck at work (a lan center in Grand Rapids, MI) since 7pm yesterday because of a lack of relief shift, and I have to work until 10am tomorrow*. I haven't had a chance to go home and pick up more food, and there's nothing in the work fridge, and I'm broke until payday next week. I ate the last of my lunch recently, so I won't need anything until later (11pm-12am or so, though I'm happy to stick it in the fridge if nothing's open that late). I'm more than happy to pay back a specific person next week on payday, or to just spread the love around to others when I can.  (* I volunteer, and spending this long down here doesn't bother me; I really do love helping out here. We lack employees that actually care, so I'm happy to take up the slack. I just lack the food to keep me going, is all.)
0	My friend told me about this and suggested it. I'm recently kicked out and staying with a friend for a while. I literally have less then ten dollars to my name and the last time i ate something was over a day and a half ago. I'm just seeing if anyone could help me out. I'm located in tennessee. Thanks in advance and hopefully someone could help me out
0	Well I'm watching my niece, my nephew, and two of his little friends tonight since their mom, my sister, is at work and won't be back until this evening.  They don't really like the food I have (Zucchini pancakes!!), and I don't have the expertise to make them something they'd enjoy.  So I come to reddit in hopes that someone can help the little ones have a dinner they'll like and hopefully hang out with their uncle even if they don't have too :)!
0	I'm a college student with no money or access to food for the next two days. Please help!
0	Hey all. I have been a lurker for about 3 years now... this rain has encouraged me to ask you guys for some warm, tasty pizza. Breaking the silence!   It has been raining here on and off for a few days.. today has made me want to start building an ark. I'm pretty broke, and it's raining so I really don't want to leave my house to walk anywhere to get something to eat. I would pay it forward as soon as I possibly could! &lt;3 
1	~~So here is the deal, Im stuck at work on a 12hr shift over night in a completely empty 12 story high rise. I dont have enough cash to order pizza ($6) and nothing close enough that i can afford(even if i did sneak away i.e. McD/Jacnk in the box/taco bell). Can pay it forward in the future~~  No longer needed thanks /u/Full-Flavor
0	Hey Ladies &amp; Gentlemen,  I would love to hang out with a pizza at around 4:00pm today... wink.  -wolfbuzz
0	we are cleaning/baby proofing our house for new foster kids. we wont have time to stop cleaning to go out and buy food and don't really have to money to spend on more then just cheap food.being as new baby necessities are very pricey and. we want to get this done and don't want to slow down our momentum and pizza we can eat as we are working. thank you in advance :)
0	I would love to chill out with a pizza tonight, I will give you a shoutout on a youtube video. (Yes I am watched by many) and I will give you a great big shoutout and thank you on video. I dont get paid till tuesday and I am sick of eating corndogs.... hahaha.. Pizza sure sounds good. 
0	Would love a RAOP to cheer me up this rainy day
0	Girlfriend of 9 months just broke up with me, turns out she slept with a guy after a night out 2 weeks ago. Had a feeling she had as everything was different (No intimacy etc) and today she told me on the phone, she leaves for Thailand tomorrow (She's an English teacher going out there for a year)  I live with my parents and they've all gone to another family members 21st birthday, didn't really feel like going but now I massively regret it, just sat here in the house with no one to talk to/vent except our mangy old cat.  Would really appreciate something to smile about. 
0	I'm not new to Reddit and I'm not from Jacksonville either. Sorry but I'm requesting incognito because I don't want anyone I know to find out about what's happening right now. There's a really messed up situation and I haven't even told my dad about this yet, so I don't want my friends or cousins finding out yet either because they can't keep their mouths shut.  I got a surprise yesterday when a guy I've never even met greets me in the hallway of my apartment building and tells me he wants me to leave my girlfriend of 2 years. My girlfriend then confronts us both and gives me the shock of my life, she's been cheating on me with this guy, and she's pregnant, but she's 90% certain neither of us is the father! She was cheating on me with this guy, and cheating on him with someone else. I've never raised a hand to a girl and never will, I was raised better than that, but I've never been more tempted in my life to haul back and deck someone!  After a two hour conversation with this dude I find out she hasn't been working for a whole year. He's been paying our electric and water since we moved into the apartment! She goes over to his house almost daily when she left me to head to work. Some days she leaves and neither of us could account for where she was. My girlfriend of 2 years is a lady of the night and has been milking 3 guys, me included and maybe more than just us, for everything we've got for years!  I'm at my bros house and he's been very tolerant of all this, real step up kind of guy to take me in because I've been living with this tramp for over a year now, I got no place else to go right now. I need something to eat because neither of us has any money and he's living off noodles right now. I'll happily pay it forward on the 8th when I get paid. But for today, I need something better than noodles or black beans and rice, and I think he would appreciate it too.  Sorry again for being a bit deceptive with my post. If I wasn't starving I wouldn't be spreading it around for that matter either. If anyone can help you have my gratitude.   8:30 AM. Taking a trip out and about, will be back in a few hours to check the thread.  Edit: 5.15 PM-- The generous contribution of another redditor who chooses to remain anonymous (like a boss) has secured dinner for me on this fine evening. I thank the dozens of folks who offered encouragement in thread and through PM as well as the others who flamed and trolled me so diligently. Ripping into you was an awesome way to blow off some steam, so you helped out a lot too. Thanks again to everyone, here's to a brighter future.

1	So, I'm unemployed. Haven't gotten enough financial aid. Ineligible for unemployment because I didn't make enough money at my last job. Majorly stressed. And to top it all, I might get evicted because the person I'm subletting from hasn't paid the landlord for 2 months. Once I pay my rent and utilities for this month (both on hold on landlord's orders until they sort out the mess) I'll have about $30 left. Unless I find a job soon or get approved for additional financial aid (my department told me to go screw myself on grants and assistantships), I'm screwed in a serious way. I really could use a pizza though.
0	College diets are a bitch, especially if you're in that awkward summer waiting time.  I'm trying to hold out until the fall quarter starts up, but it's not easy.  The twist is, I'm not actually a redditor, I don't know the community or anything.  My boyfriend is a redditor and linked the RAOP page and suggested I try it, but I myself am not a member of the community, so I completely understand if it's like a real redditors only type of thing.  But, figured I might as well try it anyway, nothing to lose right?
0	Emancipated from my family a few weeks ago, trying to find a job but it's difficult with little work experience. Nothing would be more appreciated than a little pizza to make it through the week.   -Jason
0	Recently among our other financial woes we lost our car to a colony of homeless people under the I10 bridge in New Orleans.  In addition to smashing almost all the glass and beating the sides with what we believe was a golf club, they also stole my SO's suits which were in the backseat.  While we noticed several of these fine citizens sporting some ill fitting business attire, we chose not to approach.  We found the backseat around 50 yards away, but decided to leave that behind as well since a couple of very friendly men were in the process of making it their fuck pad.  Everything that could physically be taken was, but they left us something in return!  They took a big poop in the trunk!  Alas we miss the Mitsubishi Lancer, and the only thing that could possibly dissipate our grief is a delicious hot pizza.   Can provide pictures of car as well as pictures of our really cute dog.  Thank you to fordgawn for the delicious Bacon Pizza!!!!
1	I'm not the best cook in the world and my husband works a 12 hour day, so we would really appreciate it!
0	I have had few too many things go wrong in the past couple of weeks... Really craving some comfort food! 
1	My girlfriend and I are  broke, waiting on the GI Bill to get around to paying me this month, and have only PB&amp;amp;J to eat until the money arrives. (We're running out of bread.)  So here's my proposition:  If you will buy us a pizza, I will write you a poem, and not just some crappy haiku. My girlfriend will draw a picture to go with the poem. And once the money comes in, we will pay it forward by purchasing a pizza for someone else!  So, any takers?
0	Any sort of pizza would be fucking fantastic tonight for me and my family!  We live in Canton, Michigan.  message for verification code
0	Well this has been a let down and a half of a birthday. I'm 35, and sat at home on my computer watching my 3 year old daughter. The missus is 39 weeks pregnant and bedridden with blood pressure issues that had her in hospital for two weeks. There's no possibility of a celebration or even friends popping by as my work recently changed shift patterns and my mates are all on nights. Deciding to at least salvage something from the day i decided to defrost the freezer and threw my back out moving it to get at the power point. The final topping? Payday is 3 days away and i can't even order a takeaway for us this evening, resulting in me having to hop around like a bloody screaming ape to make food. Help me Reddit, you're my only hope!  (re-posted to fix the header, apologies)
0	Title says it all. This is my main account. Last used this morning gonna detox starting tomorrow. A pizza tonight would be great.
0	Dining hall is closed, been studying and need to save gas money to drive home to Austin! Either way, love y'all and enjoy your holidays/winter solstice/christmas/hanukkah/quanza/festivus or whatever. :)
0	That title took for fucking ever to write.   That sentence too.  And that.  Fuck.
1	So I just graduated 2 days ago, and I have paid rent, graduation fees and have even had to use every dime of my graduation money to get moved. Now I've come to the middle of the week, no money and extremely hungry. Help a guy out? Willing to offer graphic design/advertising consulting! Or a copy of Dota 2! 
0	Hey, my mom went out of state leaving me in charge of the family biz while she is gone. It's 2pm and I can't leave to get lunch. Not like I know how to drive anyways. Would a pizza be too much to ask for? Please. Thanks. :)
1	Hi, I've ran out of food and I don't have any money to buy food until I get paid tomorrow. Please can a kind redditor order a pizza for me from dominos.co.uk .If you pay by credit/debit card I can walk to dominos 30 minutes away to collect it. Â£5.99 is the cheapest pizza. If you can only use paypal, you will need to order a more expensive pizza at least Â£8.99 and they have to deliver it to me. I have Â£3.20 in my paypal account I can send you. If you are kind enough to buy me one please pm me for my details. I will be forever grateful. I'm from Scotland, UK. The name of the pizza is below.  Tandoori Hot  Tandoori chicken, onions, mushrooms, green peppers, jalapeno peppers. 198kcal / large slice.  Personal (4 slices), Â£5.99
0	Hey guys; I've been out of school for about 2 weeks now, and my noodle supply has been running low this week. I haven't gotten any calls back for employment yet, but I'm hoping/gonna keep trying. A pizza would be awesome for the next couple days.  REQUEST HAS BEEN FILLED
0	I work in construction with my Dad since he created his own company years ago. Recently clients from different jobs have not paid the bills we send and we can't do much about it yet until months from now. 
0	Two tests on Monday and my friends flaked on my birthday dinner and I'm broke as a joke. A pizza would make me feel a whole lot better (and fuller!)
0	With some bills and what not I can't go shopping till I get paid Monday and I got no food in the house. Just a broke 20 year old wanting some pizza.
0	Not a charity case, but we would sure like a pizza!
0	So today is my older brother's 18th birthday. We were looking forward to making him a big birthday dinner and everything. Well every year on his birthday he's been stuck at the doctor's office or the dentist. This year it's happened again. My sister has pneumonia in her left lung and is in the ER so no birthday dinner for him sadly. It'd be nice to get a pizza or two for him to celebrate.  And if you can't give a pizza, prayers &amp; best wishes for him and my sister are just as much appreciated. Thanks guys!
0	For some weird reason the Pizza Hut in my area doesn't let you use your egiftcard through the online website-- they make you go there in person to do it. I am sick and have no car, and the bus doesn't run on weekends, so...  Would anyone like to trade? 
1	Title says it all... I had some unexpected expenses today that drained me of my money for the rest of the week. Haven't eaten since I had a cup of yogurt about 13 hours go and I'm startin' to feel it. If anyone is able to help me out with a small pepperoni I'd truly appreciate it, and if you're into gaming I can shoot you an invite to DotA 2!  
0	Im in charlotte nc, just found out that the electricity company won't get around to my property to early next week, leaving no power for me n the kids until then. Was gracefully asking for a little help.
0	I wasn't sure if this was considered a contest or a request, but since I'm the one asking for a pizza I went with the latter.  Anywho, I'd like to have a little fun around here, and since I'm bored and hungry I'd figure why not? I am willing to do just about anything (within reason) for pizza.   **Things I won't do**: Anything illegal, Porn, anything dangerous to myself or others (including eating gross stuff).  **Things I will do**: Draw you a picture, sing whatever you want and post it on soundcloud, make up a funny/scary story, etc.  Use your imagination, and let's have fun with this! Just make sure if you ask me to do something you're actually able to pay up the pie. Since I have nothing to do today I might open it up to everyone once I get a pizza offer.    **EDIT**: This is still ongoing. I received one request but they never got back with me, so I'm still willing to continue this as long as there's interest out there.
0	Working in Atlanta, absolutely willing to pizza it forward. Just want some grub. Thanks guys
0	We're not yet at the point where we need an emergency pizza, but given the expenses coming up this September (mainly uni fees, rent and rail/mÃ©tro transport cards), it might be useful to see if anyone could help us out a couple of weeks or so from now. Anybody out there willing to help out a nearly broke Redditor in France?
0	Sorry I have to be a panzy and hide behind a throwaway. This is just really embarrassing, we've received pizza from random acts of pizza before and the idea of having to turn to it again as a last resort really bothers me..   My husband is doing odd jobs as of right now until he can find a steady job, and I am about to attend college at the beginning of the year. Things have been pretty decent, but we were barely able to pay our rent this month and were only able to buy groceries for which not even lasted up until now as well as a trip to a food pantry. Our pantries and refrigerator is empty and we will not be able to get to the food pantry until tomorrow. It would mean a lot if someone could help us out and get us through the day.   I understand this is a throwaway, so if someone does decide they would like to help, I'd be more then glad to give my account name, take pictures, give you my facebook page, whatever it is you need. 
0	Came across this subreddit while "Random" surfing. I would absolutely love to get a pizza and post an offer tomorrow after 3pm when I cash my check. (Pacific time, USA)  You can even pick how I distribute tomorrow pizzas!
0	I used to be on social security but they cut me off and I'm in a phase of transition from codependency to job status and can't afford dinner tonight. It would be amazing if someone could hit me up with a meal.  I can draw animals and stuff, I'll totally draw art for pizza.  Please and thank you?
0	Its really hot around here, I dont have a fan or AC, and ive been sweating it out.  Last night I came to some rough realizations about some personal things, and I just need a day to sit back and take a day to myself.  Itd be really awesome to get some pizza!  Thanks a bunch for your consideration.  Edit;I live in Pasadena - los angeles area
0	Would much appreciate any who could fulfill this craving.  Edit: I found a way to get my pizza, please give one to someone more deserving.  Thank you
0	New to this whole RAOP thing :x I'm here visiting my sick girlfriend who lives a few hours away for the weekend and we're really hungry!  I won't be seeing her this New Years and I'm using my money for gas :|  We would really appreciate it!
0	Schools starting again, i've barely got enough money to pay for it...and there was an antibiotic screw up with my girlfriend...  So now i'm freaking out and theres not going to be much food in the hosue for a week.  Pizza would be a small pick me up.
1	Sunnyside NY to be specific! Never tried RAOP before. Will return the favor to someone else. I'm using my reddit account that's nearly 5 years old so you can hold me accountable
1	I could use a pizza since my job hasn't been open because of the holidays and that has hurt my wallet alot. I would even make a snowman for anyone that could help. Thanks :)
0	Being forced to quit my job (long story), have a holiday coming up that is paid for (luckily) but leaves me literally penniless until I can find something else to do for work, not to mention christmas presents for the people I love. I'm sitting at work today, by myself, coming to terms with the fact that these are my last few days until unemployment happens.  A cheese and pineapple would literally make the rest of my year. I'll reward you with love in any form I can.
0	thx bros
0	I've been working at an Italian joint in North/ Western Michigan over the summer.. They sell pizza but I never ate there due to unsanitary and poor working conditions. Today I went in for my shift and I'd been completely taken off the schedule, without any warning. What a bummer! And last night I spent a few hundred dollars on my boyfriend's birthday presents.  I'm working on a scrapbook for him now, while singing Gimme pizza.. Slow. "Uh, did I happen to say, I want pizza?" Thanks for reading.
0	Anyone want to send us a domino's pizza? I can't spend what little money I have until the 4th of February and my boyfriend only has about $5. We only have 4 slices of bologna and a block of cheese~ looking for something a bit more exciting than bologna and cheese :/ Willing to send a present in exchange &lt;3
0	I just want a little something to brighten the week up, and I'm getting pretty damn sick of ramen every day.  Pretty terrible week altogether, culminating in running out of gas on the highway last night with no money. Met with a few very nice strangers at a gas station a few hours later who knew a police officer that paid for a few gallons that got me home.
0	Hey guys, im very hungry. i havent eaten all day, and have been hungry the psat few weeks since i lost my job. Im 18 and my parents live four states away. I live in a townhouse with 5 other guys and seeing them all bring their thanksgiving leftovers home really sucked, as i spent it by myself eating what was left of my canned soup. Today has been the breaking point where i have to ask, im starving:(
1	Hey guys :) Just found this website...what a miracle. Basically, me and my sister are students and are trying our hardest not to ask our parents for money all summer like we usually do. We have no money until Sunday where we are doing a paid photo-shoot but right now, we are SO hungry.  If we got pizza it would save us as we get so irritable when we're hungry (we all know the feeling)  Please help us!!! We will definitely repay the favour on Sunday! (pizza all round yayay!)  Lola &amp; Heidi
0	Me and the fam damily would love some pizza for supper tonight, so I figured hell, let's give it a go :-)
0	Rent was due last week and it cost me my whole paycheck. I'm literally broke til Saturday morning and have absolutely nothing to eat at my apartment. I would really love some pizza to get me through these next couple of days. I would really love any help and promise to pay it forward as soon as I get my financial situation back on track. I love you guys.  
0	My landlord double-leased the apartment we were staying in, resulting in them showing up last Thursday morning to kick us out. We disputed and proved our lease wasn't until up until the 31st of August, but they did everything in their power to get us out early. They're supposed to refund our unused rent and give us a little extra, but there's no telling when we'll see that check. We've spent every dime we have moving into a new place; deposit, first and last month's rent, getting utilities turned on, etc. really adds up. We're looking at an empty pantry and totally bummed. If someone could get us a pizza for tonight we'd be incredibly grateful.
0	I graduated last fall with a major in communications. I definitely regret not choosing a major that was more profitable, as I am still working the same retail job that I've had for a few years. I don't mind my job but I'm ready to branch out and find something better. As I got closer and closer to my graduation date I kept telling myself that 2012 is my year. I am not new to Reddit or living check to check, so I'm here looking for a mutual exchange. I'm proficient with Microsoft Office, Photoshop, Quickbooks, and researching just about any topic for you. It has been so long since I've had a meal that wasn't rice, beans or noodles. I'm very grateful for what I have, but a pizza would just rock my world! Please let me know what kind of work you would like to have done and any deadlines if possible. Thank you for considering me.
0	So turns out my gf has bronchitis and when she went in to work her boss made her leave in fear of "infecting the other employees." So now we're just hangin out at home, about to get down on some halo 4.  The only thing that could make this day more perfect, aside from her getting miraculously better, would be a nice tasty surprise from someone nice.  Will provide pics of us enjoying said pie, and if we can get a good shot of it, us beatin face.  Cheers!
0	I've been wanting to choose a different color for my room. I don't think anything like this has been done here before (long term lurker) so hopefully I get some points for at least being original. Yes this is a request and yes I will paint my walls any one color that my generous offer-er requests. I'm **not** starving, trying to feed 10 people, telling a made up sob story, or crying over having ugly walls. Still with me? Ok. Lets have some fun with this!  I have linked some pictures below, so that you see what you have to work with. The walls are an off white/egg color (bleh). Have you ever gone to someone's house and thought "Wow, why did they pick this stupid color?" I am regretting my decision of selecting this color. Just placing one finger on the wall and that one spot is now 10x darker than the rest of the wall. Maybe I just have dirty fingers? :D  I hope I can satisfy someones curiosity or desire in just wanting to have some control or a say over someone else's living space. I'm not a good designer by any means. I still think a milk crate and a towel make a perfect chair. No wonder I'm single.   Anyway, I want to thank you for reading my very long post. I hope you enjoy your Saturday and won't spend the day watching paint dry. Please pick a good color. Any color other than white/egg shell. Please and thank you :)  [Pics of my room](http://imgur.com/a/qRQa7).  **Edit**: I appreciate having the opportunity to do something like this. Unfortunately, the store will be closing soon and I have not done any painting today. Based on the comments below, I've decided on a nice shade of green. Please remember that the world needs more kindness and compassion - Treat others like you wish to be treated, make each day count and follow your dreams. I will be back to post pictures of my newly painted room. Thank you Random Acts of Pizza for all that you do!
0	FORGOT TO PUT LOCATION - RHODE ISLAND  So there are three of us living here. Two adult males, and an adult female.  Somehow our finances were completely drained this month. no food, no money, paycheck isn't coming until the second, and we're apparently too rich for food pantries.  Our resident artist has said she will draw anything you like, and our resident... something has said he will thank you profusely as he has no discernable skills that can be applied to the internet. (he's really good at RPGs. doesnt help here.)  Now there are a thousand pity stories all over the4 internet, so we decided to add a bit of proof. Pics of bank account, fridge, etc.  http://i50.tinypic.com/28iw93n.jpg http://i46.tinypic.com/dbnjac.jpg http://i49.tinypic.com/2637kw3.jpg and yes this says we're 0.75 cents in the red.  http://i46.tinypic.com/xo08j4.jpg
0	My husband just started a new job but until we get his first paycheck we are completely broke.  He is at work and I have the flu and can't get up off the couch and my three children are bugging me about what is for dinner.  Would anyone be kind enough to provide a pizza for us? 
0	I got fired over a stupid coworker messing up. He stole my swipe card, signed into the cash till and $300 went missing. Because my name was on the register, i got canned. It's been a really bad day and I just need a pick me up in the form of pizza.      I live in Canada if that helps. I fully plan to pay it forward when I can, I just can't spend anything right now.
0	Hi RAOP!  My two roommates and I are all full time volunteers working with AmeriCorps this year. We get payed less than minimum wage, and work full time serving people in poverty.  We're all really hungry right now, and we spent all of our money on rent and bills.  Anyone care to hook three starving, hard working people with some Papa John's?
0	Short and sweet.  Ate shit at the skatepark yesterday, ComEd and RCN cleaned my bank account out.   If anyone has the means can you send me a pizza tonight when I get off work? No extravagance necessary and anything and everything will be appreciated.  Thank you all. 
0	Hey everyone,  I'm a student here at PSU and I'm going through a bit of a rough patch here financially. I haven't eaten anything but ramen and spaghettiOs for a while and I'd love to actually have a nice hot pizza. Please let me know if you could help me out tonight. I'd appreciate it greatly, thanks!
0	As the title says, broke, alone and would love a pizza. I'll answer all questions :)
0	In Canada by the way. 
1	I've got some food to hold me over until friday if I'm creative w/ my meals but I've only got $10 in my wallet and anything left in the bank is going in my tank to get to work. I've had a rough weekend and I could use a pizza tonight. I'll pay it forward on payday.
0	Dammit, I forgot the location. I'm sorry! Location is **St. John's, NL, Canada**  Today, I moved. I spent the past 2 hours throwing boxes and a bed onto a truck, dragging that across the city, and then hurling it into a new bedroom. It has been 27 degrees here in St. John's (80F) and the humidity isn't exactly being kind either. I've already taken a shower. I feel like a new one.  I could make food, I'm not going to lie. I've got boneless/skinless chicken breasts downstairs, I've got pasta and sauces, I've got marshmallows. However, I'd really just like to kick up on Canada Day, relax, and munch on some pizza. Can provide any proof you'd like.
1	Hello,  I asked an old roommate if he could help me out, and he pointed me to this site. I'm not sure how this works or really what I'm doing. Basically, I was really stupid, and somehow left my refrigerator door open, and my electricity bill went from around $40 to an unexpected $100. I'm honestly not sure what I'm going to do about food in the upcoming week, since I'm out the grocery money I was expecting. I have about 15$ in my wallet, but until they 15th I won't have a paycheck to do anything else. Please let me know if I have to do anything to prove this. I'm embarrassed that I have to beg. To be honest, my stomach hurts today from eating only bread that I froze to make it last longer.  Best regards,  Allen  Thank you DundahMifflin, because of you I will have something tasty to eat for a couple days. I really appreciate it so much. It's so nice to see a community like this.
0	Hello reddit,  Here's our story.  We're at a friend's house in (essentially) the middle of nowhere. We've come down to stay for a few days, and none of us have cars, so we're essentially stuck food free.  Now, here's the tricky part. The two people we are staying with are currently having 'a relationship tiff'. Essentially they've left us downstairs, post several joints, and we have absolutely no food, and a tremendous, burning desire for it.  We're sat desperately hoping they aren't breaking up, as this would be seriously uncool whilst high, and it would firmly delay our chance to eat pizza.  Thank you.
0	i literally have been eating rice with sriracha (nothing else in the fridge) for the past few days, hoping for some pizza to switch it up (and i guess to restore some of my strained faith in humanity? ...i suppose?)   :/   long story short: went back to school and had to work shitty retail gig part time, barely making ends. now outta cash, but just started sweet new job. kind of getting by, barely, due to great friends.   i think this is a nice idea, i'd definitely pay it forward when i get paid. Ask when you need, give when you can...right? Thanks if you can, no worries if you can't :)  (throwaway account btw)  EDIT: Forgot to say in Toronto
1	i love pizza and have no means to get it. hoping someone understands the eternal craving for a pepperoni pie. i will pay it forward when i can (within the next week) &lt;3 thanks for reading  edit: huge thank you to ns0 for hooking it up last night! this sub rocks
0	**EDIT**: fark, I'm slow and forgot to post my location. I'm in Virginia.  First of, Happy Labor Day! I hope everyone has had an awesome day.  Like the post says, I simply lack the energy today to cook. I tried taking Effexor (an anti-depressant drug) and it didn't go well for me (lots of nausea and loss of appetite) so I decided to not take take it anymore. Of course, going off of an anti-depressant makes you kind of moody and that's where I am now.   So, I'm here in hopes that someone will toss a pizza my way.   P.S.: if you need verification, I can send you a verification code as well as a picture of the pills/pill bottle.
0	So my coworker's lunch got stolen. I felt bad for him since it had happened to me before (we work in a fairly big building with lots of strangers coming though so theft happens). I offered to help him get another one and even to go pick it up for him. Apparently this is tantamount to admission of guilt? Next thing i know I'm being accused of being the dastardly pizza thief.    I haven't even had pizza in ages, but if anyone has a spare pie id love to be caught with some evidence. :3
1	I currently have no groceries and no money in my checking, and the credit card is maxed.  I have been working as much as my boss allows while still going to classes and barely affording my rent. I am just looking to feed myself until Monday when my boss gives me my check.   Once I finish this semester and start my internship in the summer, I am sure I can pay this forward!  
0	[This is also a crosspost from /r/RandomActsofPizza - I'll close that posting if I get a reply here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPizza/comments/z59hz/request_havent_eaten_in_two_days_ate_nothing_but/)  So about 3 months ago I was fired from my old job. That's normally not a problem here in Germany, but to make a VERY long story short: The government agencies that are supposed to help you out in a case such as this didn't help me out. I haven't recieved any money in 3 months. So I have been living off of left-overs some friends bring by sometime. I'm a freelance voice-actor, but I haven't gotten any contracts lately, except for a bigger one 1 1/2 weeks ago.  However, my 'boss' there hasn't paid me yet. I'm about to lose my apartment and I ran out of food.  I'm not sitting idly by though - I've been sending out CVs like crazy and have gotten an interview for next week. We'll see how that goes.  So yeah, there's the short version of what happened. I don't really know what I'm supposed to write here, sorry. If you have any question, go ahead and ask.  If anyone is actually willing to send me pizza, then there could be a minor problem seeing as I live in Germany. But - if you have a credit card (mastercard/visa) we could use [lieferando](http://www.lieferando.de). I can guide you through the ordering process via Skype for example - or I'll write something up.  If you want me to do something for the Pizza: I could record something for you.  Thanks for reading, I guess?
0	I'm so hungry and don't have money and would be so beyond happy to get a pizza from a kind person such as yourself,I am an artist I will draw you a beautiful picture showing my appreciation. &lt;3.   SORRY. Forgot to put, VISTA,CALIFORNIA. Thanks. 
0	Starving, upset with USPS for slacking on check delivery, car-less and it's raining (not meatballs). Will buy whoever gets me a pizza next week. 
0	Hi, typical broke college kids here. Boyfriend and I have been really struggling the past week and after catching up on the bills for this month have little under $1 in our bank account.. We were hoping for a random act of pizza to hold us over until my check clears tomorrow so we can actually get groceries. Really appreciate any help!!
0	I'm sitting here, working on an internet radio station I'm starting. I was searching for free pizza coupons. RetailMeNot didn't help. I was about to give up hope when I remembered that there exists a Random Acts of Pizza subreddit. If you would like to donate a pizza, I would eat that pizza with gratitude... and, if you're located in San Diego, CA, I'm looking for DJs.
0	I am not sure about sites like these but my neighbor told me about this website so I figured I would give it a try. I am a single pregnant mother of 1 child will be 2 when this one is born. A couple of weeks ago my husband decided he wanted to be with his ex so he left and went back to  her and left us alone. He has not paid one cent in child support since he left. I had quit working so I could go back to school in March so I do not have a job which makes it hard on me. I am looking for a job everyday but no luck yet. I would love to have one night where I do not have to worry about what to feed my son and myself. If someone can help me with pizza I would appreciate it very much. We only have a pizza hut here and I do not have a car so I can not go pick it up it will have to be delivered so I know you have to have a 12.00 order to get delivery. Thank you to anyone who can help me.
0	Money's tight and we need to go grocery shopping. Down to chicken stock and ramen noodle. Was hoping to get a ROAP before work tonight, we live in the DC metropolitan area, specifically Northern VA
1	Me and my girlfriend and her little nieces just got back from walking to jack in a box hoping to get 2 orders of tacos for the 3 bucks in pennies and nickels we had, but there was a problem, the cashier was a total jerk and did not want to take our change because she didn't want to count the bit we had there. So now i feel bad for her ( and my future) nieces ;) and we are on the hunt for random pizza ! 
0	Howdy!  I was promptly laid off yesterday at 4:45pm and my wife is currently out of town at a wedding. I'm making a grilled cheese sandwich for lunch, but would love a pizza! Whether I get an offer or not, you guys are awesome. Keep up the work!  Edit: I'm in North Carolina
0	Just came back from a festival with 2 zips of the blue dream.  Needless to say, me and three of my friends are pretty fucking high.  Any amount of pizza would probably be the most amazing thing that could happen right now.  I would also like to show these stoners the awesomeness that is Reddit.  Thanks &lt;3
0	Would appreciate some pizza, but it's late here so preferably a Casey's online giftcard so we can get it now. Thanks in advance, I know it's not a great story but we're pretty hungry at this point.   EDIT: Link to the $10 giftcard, my bad: http://store.caseys.com/product.php?productid=3&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1
0	So, I know it's late right now, 12:58am to be exact (in my timezone at least) but I'm craving a pizza and wanted to know whether or not anyone would be willing to gift a pizza n wings and I will sing whatever song you want!! It's with a webcam though so I'm sorry if it's crap quality, but I will definitely do it!! :)   seriously.
0	Had minor surgery on Sunday that put me on some restrictions such as no driving until cleared. So I'm stuck here bored and hungry with pizza on my mind, and I was curious if someone would be kind enough to send a pizza my way. Thanks.
1	I was wondering if anyone out there could bless my son with a pizza for dinner tonight. I'm a 27 year old single mom struggling financially right now raising my 7 year old son by myself. Just went through a long drawn out divorce but I wont bore anybody with my personal problems. I'm currently receiving a little bit of food stamps each month but i reallyy have to make them stretch just to get by, which means lots of ramen noodles for dinner. tonight my son is begging and beggingme for a pizza that i just cant afford for him. I was hoping to give this site a shot and see if anyone can make my sons night and bless us with a small pizza for him. thank you so much for listening to my long rambling but he wont stop bugging me about pizza tonight lol, you know how that is :)  I'm in Greensburg,KY and we dont have any pizzaq chains closeby as its a small city but I know we have a pizza hut in town if anyone can help
0	Title pretty much says it all. I'd like not to disappoint them, so I was hoping someone could help. I can pay it back later next month.
0	Much appreciated. :)
0	Pretty much explained myself in the title. The comment thread will be in /r/SelectiveDestiny, oh and don't forget to tell me which genre you would like for your adventure.
0	I haven't eaten in 2 days and have absolutely nothing in my apartment to eat.  I am almost ready to resort to eating Spicy Ranch sauce...
0	I get payed again in a little over a week, however I'm playing the ever so dangerous college game of gasorfood. Will return the favor to one lucky redditor when I get payed. We used to do this for guildies in some video games back in the day, I think its rad that something like this exists outside of that world.
1	It would make a great birthday gift, thanks in advance.
1	Hi guys, I missed an entire week of work and I have one dollar left, I had a tooth abscess on me and had to have extremely painful surgery, the infection is all gone finally and I can eat again, been stuck drinking ensure since Thursday, trouble is this poor girl is broker than broke, I have three of us to feed and dunno what i'm going to do for dinner, there is one can of soup in the cupboard. If someone would be willing to front me a pizza when i get paid next i'll gift one to someone. Pweeese?  EDIT :Also I don't have family...so there will be no thanksgiving meal for me this year, this would really be a nice happy thing, I could use it right at the moment :-( And PapaJohns is the chain we have here.  EDIT: This really would mean so much to me guys, I've never had to deal with getting a tooth pulled before and my face is just returning to normal, the last thing I need right now is stress, I have two others that live with me who haven't been able to find a job because of the economy so I'm the only one who works, this is going to put is in a tight spot and I'm still not sure how things are going to go but for tonight, the first night I have the ability to even have solid food, I don't want to worry.  Also if interested I can provide a picture of a very doofy looking dog, possibly two in exchange. 
0	I haven't been able to go and get paid yet because my boss won't let me near the store for fear that I will infect him.  Plus I've been off work for 4 days now which means I won't get paid for that time.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.
1	We just moved to MD in January and still trying to get caught up in bills, and I'm just trying to break up the cycle of rice and pasta that we've been on for the last week and a half.  I'm okay with still eating the same stuff until we get paid, but I want him to be happy and I don't have the money right now to treat him to a bacon pizza from Domino's. :\
0	Today while on a 5-6 hour hike, We returned to the city and I came home realizing that my ID'S Debits and all of that good stuff did not make it back with me and being in a new place this month the fridge and cupboards have nothing in them. Accept for a pouch of taco seasoning which might be ok but...   Sadly being 10:43pm I cannot get my bank stuff figured out. I do not want it for free I most defiantly want to barter here  is a list of things I can provide. -Pay it forwards once cards renewed -Write you a personalized poem (Hand written and shipped by request) - Anything graphic design or audio engineering related  - a print of some of my art work (Sent by request) - or anything you can come up with that I'm able.  I have never done this before I'm curious to see the outcome Cheers :)
1	Anyone willing to order us a pizza just for today? Even a small pizza will make a difference, we're just really really hungry and ran out of food earlier than we expected, Our checks come tomorrow so we Will help thos in need  Thanks a bunch reddit
0	I'm craving pizza something fierce and only have money in my paypal at the moment. After looking around online, I can't seem to find anywhere that accepts paypal as a payment option.   Anyway, if anyone can give me information to order with paypal or maybe if i could pay someone with paypal to order for me it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance!
0	Broke until the weekend and barely have groceries :/ have enough to survive but I would really love pizza....I'm a known pizza addict amoungst my friends. I would be forever grateful!
1	I am a single mother of 1 on disability and would love to treat my daughter with her favorite pizza. I am on disability and only have $40 to last us the rest of the month. We have been eating ramen noodles and very simple foods. I would love to be able to treat my daughter to her favorite pizza hut pizza but I am completly broke and need the $40 to last. This has too be used for gas and basic toiletries and food as well. I just found out about this site and think it is amazing that their are people out there willing to help complete strangers. Bless you all. I hope you can help. A pizza hut giftcard would really make her day. Will provide verification too. Thanks again!
0	Haven't found a real job. Just graduated from Appalachian State University with a double major in Risk Management &amp; Insurance and Economics. Been eating Ramen Noodles for 2 days just ran out. Super broke looking for some delicious pizza. Favorite toppings are pepperoni and pineapple,but would be pumped for anything.
0	I'm kinda in a rough point. Got laid off and lost my place.. now I'm waiting for food stamps and my friend is kind enough to let me crash here but not eat and keeps eating in front of me too. If someone could please help me I'd really appreciate it.
0	I'm a college student in Seattle, WA that is looking for a job, but I'm running super low on funds right now. Papa John's has a buy one get one free today, and that could feed me until friday! I'm totally new on here, but would be so stoked if somebody could help out. If this does work, I will pay it forward, because I don't want the guilt of receiving two free pizzas without helping out somebody else when I can to give me indigestion. I don't think there's a Random Acts of Tums on here anyways.
0	My friends birthday is today and I'd love to treat him to a nice pizza but I just don't have the funds.  If anyone can help it would be greatly appreciated! 
1	I seriously love buffalo chicken pizza. Like, straight up addicted. There's a local pizzeria that delivers and they make the best buffalo chicken pizza I've ever had; however if you dont feel safe with that or have a Giftcard to a chain I could care less, I just want a buffalo chicken pizza soooo bad! 
0	I can get in my chair for a few minutes to get to the door but not much else. Pretty hungry and when my financial situation is figure out will pay it forward to someone else in need. Verification would be gross but doable. The sore was healed but opened back up recently which is pretty tough to deal with. I am bound to a wheelchair and the wound is on my inner right thigh.
1	Welp, this week the Federal payment system mixed me up with someone who got half of his pay revoked this month.  The good news is that I get payed 150% next paycheck. The bad news is that I didn't know I was only 50% until I got notified by my bank yesterday. A Pizza from Dominoes would certainly help me cheer up and save the last bit of dough I have (pun intended) to make it to the end of the month.  If done, in July I will pay that shit forward!
0	Hello,  Yesterday I went to get groceries and I switch to small bag purse. Now my wallet is in the small bag purse. In my wallet it has my ID so I can't get money at a bank. Today is payday and I do have money but no access to it.I am too afraid to ask my coworkers to borrow money as I am a student worker so my coworkers are all my supervisors.  I work at 8am everyday and I skip breakfast. I don't want to be greedy and get a whole pizza so that is why I am asking for a sandwich.  You can check my account, I have send strangers random cards to try to pay it forward.  EDIT: I didn't get anything but that is okay. I get off work in a hour and I can go home and finally eat something.
0	I haven't seen my best friend in over 5 years. I was finally in the area, and gave him a call, but he lived really far away. I scrounged up all the gas money I could to go see him, and ended up with just enough for there and back. He is a poor college kid, and has no food (his girlfriend and him have an arrangement.) Please help us relive the glory of our teenage years. Message me for address.
0	my roommate and I are running low on funds and a good pizza would be greatly appreciated Edit: From Kansas USA
1	I am an unemployed musician in Tennessee who can't offer much except a place to stay and some possible unpaid shows to bands passing through. I am currently hosting a 4 piece band from upstate NY for a couple of days. Normally we can busk downtown for some extra food money but we've only made $13 bucks between the 5 of us in the past couple of days. Any help with a couple of pizzas and I'll send you a free download link!  EDIT: SallyMacLennane just made everyones night! Not only will I personally be paying this back, but the boys in the band have all subscribed and plan on doing their thing to help out in the future!
0	Came home to a broken fridge filled with curdling milk and molded cheese. The repairman came and said it would cost less to just buy a new fridge than to get the parts to fix it. I live in Missouri and don't really want to give my location, so giftcard...? Never posted here before! Also there is Imo's where I live.
0	Things are a bit tight right now, but I'll be able to repay at the end of the month. Christmas pizza, yay =)  A bit about me, if it interests you- I'm currently a full time volunteer (like in the Peace Corps, but not called the Peace Corps) working at a small nonprofit in DC. I live in a big house with 12 other volunteers (I am NOT requesting pizza for 12 people, goodness xD) I just learned how to ride a bicycle last summer, and I play a bunch of instruments.  Thanks for looking =)
0	I'm poor and could really use a pie, simple as that.
0	Someone stole $100 from my landlord and employers bedroom. No one is fessing up and now Im fucked. No more job, or home. I seriously regret hosting parties for my fuckwad friends. Now without a car, Ive got a whole shitload of issues to solve. I got $5 to my name, and if it werent for lack of availability, Id be back on the H train. Clean 3 months now, and the dope dreams are back in fulll force.   This doesnt even cover half of it. Its enough to not personally identify me without a throwaway account. 
0	No sob story. I'm just hungover as fuck and would seriously appreciate a delicious, cheesy pizza. Now I'm going to go cry in a corner and try to work out just how many vodka slushies and tequila shots I inflicted on myself last night.  Peace!
1	Been a cancer(glioblastoma) survivor for 3 years now and been trying to find myself a permanent stable job, been surviving but this month has been rough. High bills this month and a car accident have cost me a lot of money, plus the gas use from having like 4 appts with the doctor and oncology(both about 30 min away) have drained my acct to about 2 dollars. It'd be awesome to dig into a pizza tonight instead of try and find something resembling a meal in my fridge or resorting to eating a roommate's food since he's not in the best of situations either.   Halp?
0	I've been job searching for a bit now but haven't had much luck or funds for pizza. My accounts actually overdrawn at the moment and any more cash would cause some bullshit overdraft fee so thats out of the question.  Could really use a cheesey pick me up :)
1	Er, so yeah.  I'm feeling a little peckish and could really use some brain food to help keep me up tonight.  I believe the dominos where I live is open until midnight.  I'm on the east coast.  [How much money I have.](http://i.imgur.com/VYlTr.jpg)  I get paid at the end of the week and will most definitely pay it forward!  Edit:  Thanks so much to Bioraiku for helping me out!  Expect me to be here with an [Offer] tag come payday. :]
0	November is notorious for "no-shave" or "no-whatever" 30 day fasting, but this is crossing the line! We have bonded over so many things via pizza, it is one of the major cornerstones of our friendship. I have already fought several long battles with her over this- how dare she leave me in the trenches alone! She will be home from work in about an hour and a half to two hours. This is my final stand against no-pizza-november, she won't listen to my reasoning any longer - Reddit help me out and be the calvary!  EDIT: SUCCESSSSSSSSS!! Thanks to TheSheepdog she finally caved in!! "Last one for the month.." Psh yeah right. She knows she loves this bonding session way too much, haha. [Here are some pics!](http://imgur.com/a/t9Yr7#0) Don't let her fake sad face fool you, she loved every bite :)
0	I get paid at the end of the month,  the final week is always a struggle.  I could ration a pizza, if I had a pizza.   I'm willing to return the favor then, or I can take a funny pictures involving cats and pizza. 
1	So I'm financially a little shaky right now, as I don't start my new job until September and I just graduated. Anyway I was cycling around today and I was just setting off from the center of the city where I live when I spotted a Specialized bicycle with a flat tyre. Thinking of being the good samaritan, I decided to wait around and give this friend in need some much required assistance.      Shortly along comes his girlfriend, who sees me pushing on the tire (to check the pressure). She isn't aggressive or suchlike but she does go and get her boyfriend, who upon realisation of my motive is thankful for the assist. This is where it gets interesting - turns out this guy's "friend" had asked him for drug money, and when he had declined, the "friend" had slashed his tire with a knife - in fact, quite a large one. This friend was also sat across the street, well within viewing distance.  Naturally, I'm suddenly feeling a little less confident about this whole thing. Nonetheless, I grab my pump and toolkit saddlebag, and start whipping out the gear. We get the tire off just as another of this dude's "friends" comes over, and starts to be generally unhelpful and stand around in the way... whatever, I can still deal. His girlfriend also comes over, and they begin chatting about general shit. One topic that keeps coming up is how the gentleman I am in the midst of assisting is "still on tag" - which means they have been convicted of some kind of crime in the UK. Normally a tag also involves a curfew, and they are often handed out for violent crime. Nice. Turns out his mate is also "on tag". Nothing quite like roadside repair while surrounded by individuals with a penchant for violence should things not go their way.  By this point, we have patched the tube in two places and all seems well. On goes the tire, with the help of my handy tyre lever - or so we thought. The guy with the violent past is obviously not too much in control of his strength, as he snaps my tyre lever in half. Lovely. Just to top it all off, the guy's tire is still flat. Turns out two 1cm holes opposite each other on the tube just won't patch properly. Who'da thunk it? So anyway, "thanks anyway"s are exchanged, and I begin the ride home - only to find that while leaving the site of my ad-hoc repairwork, I have a nice chunk of glass lodged in my own tire, and my tube is deflating with a deeply unwelcome hiss.  Defeated, I begin the long walk (push) to the nearest bike shop. Rather than treating myself to the takeaway I had been previously planning to devour, I find myself rather forlornly spending the money on a new tyre lever so that I can repair my own bicycle and actually make it home. Upon arrival I find myself faced with half a can of beans or something unidentifiable and frozen. While my need may not be so great as that of other Redditors, I hope at least that my story has been enjoyable. Thanks for reading to the end!  EDIT: TL;DR, I helped out a criminal repair what was probably a stolen bicycle while surrounded by sketchy people and subsequently had to spend my dinner money on a replacement tool he broke so that I could fix my own ride.
0	I don't know what to do.  I suppose I should've seen this coming -- she used to disappear for days on end, and I couldn't make contact with her, let find out where she went -- but nothing can really prepare you for it. We even traveled *across the country* together for college, and now she's gone. From Seattle to North Carolina, for god's sake. For all I know she could be in some other guy's pants right now. I miss her. I miss how she smelled, how I could always turn to her in times of trouble, because, deep down inside, she held the answers.    I miss my wallet.
0	Ok maybe it's because I only slept 3 hours, but after reading the sidebar I can't for the life of me figure out how to respond to a request. Help?
1	First world problems here, nothing major.  Short story, I am working on two competing projects within one company (doesn't make sense to me either) and I have tight deadlines on both.  So that means I get to work this weekend in order to even come close to meeting the deadline.  Who wants to cheer me up?  If nobody, that's cool too.
0	Hi there.  I was hoping that maybe someone would be willing to donate a pizza to my SO and I.  My mother has our baby for the night and I would love to relax with some pizza and video games, but I don't get paid until Friday, and our kitchen is starting to look rather bare.  You can believe I will definitely be passing this forward when I get paid.
0	We are a group of five local community college kids in Modesto CA, gathering to play some retro games (NES and SNES) and we are all dying for a change of ramen. Would anyone be kind enough to help us out? Some pie sounds fantastic (when doesn't it?)  Thanks for reading.  FSM bless.
1	this is my first time on this site, but i thought i should give it a try because i am really struggling. my husband of 4 years walked out on me and the kids almost a month ago. he got a new job and just up and left. we had a joint bank account and that all that has been feeding me and the kids, but now he transferred most of the money out of it and we have nothing. i was a stay at home mom, but now i am looking for a job so that me and my kids can get toiletries and basic supplies. my parents are still in the picture, but they dont understand why i dont try to reconnect with my husband, who i havent even spoke to and cannot find. they sent my children diapers, but im low on those now. all i am looking for is pizza for tonight it would make my kids day and cheer them up. there dad was a good man at one time and my kids still love him. they miss him and dont understand why he left. i couldnt bear to tell them the truth so i said he went on a trip. please somebody help us out with dinner for tonight. 
0	Forgot my wallet on a bus with 120 in cash and my debit card, could really use and appreciate a RAoP. 
0	Me and my group members are busy working on a lab, and cannot leave the lab 
0	I would love a pizza right now.  I don't need it; there's no sad story to my life that would make a pizza truly beneficial right now; I just feel like eating pizza.  I understand if no one wants to buy me one, but I would greatly appreciate it.  If you want, I could photoshop your name to look cool or something like that.  This is my first time asking for pizza, so if you have any kind of request in return, such as a wallpaper, I will gladly oblige.
1	Basically, I have 22 cents in my bank account and am craving pizza. I don't like asking for things but, all I have are gift cards. So, I am offering a [$25 itunes giftcard] (http://i.imgur.com/KLJKq.jpg) in return for pizza! It's a win-win situation. 
0	So, well. My girlfriend and I are 20, and 22 years old respectively. We decided to follow our dreams of creating a digital marketing/design firm about a year and a half ago. The road has been long and hard, we slept on my father's couch in a trailer for 6 months, a dank basement (on the floor) with people who didn't really want us there for the last 9, sometimes living off ramen as we all have to sometimes.  But here we are, on the advent of our success, and Christopher Columbus messes it up. We have a large check coming in the mail, but we didn't get it today because of the holiday. We are currently staying in a Motel 6 for a week, to scout/establish places to live, as we FINALLY after a year and a half of hard work, destitution, doubt and confidence, and above all courage, enough money to get (and keep) ourselves afloat, and enough clientele to support us through the months.  We're getting an apartment with the money that's coming in (and of course food), but we had planned on renting a single bed motel room for a week for $259, which would've left us with more than enough for simple groceries. They only had a 2 bed avaliable, for about $290. We only had about $310 in cash at that point, so needless to say that the remainder of the money is gone, and we were reliant on that check coming in today to be able to eat. Christopher Columbus! Note, we have NO where else to stay besides outside, no family, nothing.  We haven't ate a meal in around 30 hours, and while we've gone much, much longer before (box of cheerios and a bag of Ore Ida fries for a week... lol) , we just really don't want to go through the slow agony of starving again, especially when we're so on the cusp of being self reliant.  So I ask if there's any kind soul out there that would bless us with a pizza tonight, with the full intention of us paying you back within the next few days if wanted. We have a LOT of work to do, and not eating for an entire day isn't exactly great on your concentration, especially when dealing with tedious stuff like coding.  Proof avaliable if needed :) thanks!
1	Hey y'all.  I'm a video producer in Chicago and my biggest client yet decided he wanted to use the work I gave him and not pay for it.  I've spent ALL day today and yesterday looking for work just so I can put some food in my refrigerator.  Rent and utilities are covered, but I haven't had a "real" meal in over a week.  Dominos sounds so incredibly good right now for my belly and attitude towards the human race.    Anyway, I am willing to make some motion graphics or logo designs.  I will work for my pie!  Peace.
0	I have to spend my night studying calculus, it's either ramen noodles or pizza, I am hoping for pizza. (Chicago)
0	In a moment of thoughtlessness, I completely neglected to add in the baking powder- that thing was as hard as a rock. Instead, I left it at home, and we drove to his friend's dorm about an hour away, and after a night of their LoL playing and my Redditing (pretty hard work, right?), we're starved. We'd really appreciate a pizza after a place opens up; I think the earliest is Papa Johns at 9 am.   Also, I'll be repaying the offer in the first week of January when my university refund comes in. :D
0	Due to a slight emergency I wasn't able to register classes now, but classes already started and classes are booked. I just want something to make this day go better. 
1	I just moved to Indianapolis while I take a semester off of college from Indiana State and I have no food or drink. I was supposed to get money dropped into my account today from a friend that owes me money from work I did for them but they had difficulties with their car. I'm just in a bad spot tonight so if I could get a pizza bro'd to me that would be great. I have a job interview at Marsh soon and I'll make sure to re-forward the kindness as soon as possible. Thanks reddit! EDIT: read the sidebar and got my verification number!
0	I just recently moved to the Kingsburg area near Fresno and am struggling to even pay for medications I need let alone food. A pizza would really bring my spirits up right now. 
0	Hi all, I am a college student, ran out of food today. I don't get paid until tomorrow, so until then I'm just sitting around trying to conserve energy. Judging from my pantry, my roommates would enjoy a slice as well. :) I would love it if someone could feed me tonight, and so I can help feed my roommate as well. Thanks, everyone!  I also have a verification code, if that helps. Also, I honestly don't need much. I have very little money, enough to cover half a pizza. Anything would help.
0	Live on very limited income just can't afford a pizza right now and would love to have a pizza.
0	Hey my payday has been delayed due to the holiday so I was hoping to get some pizza to help me hold over until it comes in. Thanks. 
0	I'm 23 years old. My husband is 20. We live in Ohio right now and I DO work but it's barely paying the rent. We applied for food assistance just until we can get on our feet but they said it can take up to 30 days just for a decision. My husband can't work right now and I'm trying so desperately to find work on the side to feed us and pay for his immigration. See, me and my hubby met online in a Dragonball Z chatroom when we were young teenagers and we fell in love. He is Canadian and anyone out there who fell in love with someone in another country understands that it's an expensive process. We're both depressed. Me because I can't do more. And him because he can't work and support his family. We're making progress but slowly. We also have a 2 1/2 month old son. He is eating (and quite well if I were to be honest.. He's a little chow hound!) We've been living on Ramen Noodles and those cheap 99.9 percent water meats and bread. We don't even have ketchup or mustard anymore. The pepper is gone, the salt is almost there. Will take a picture of our fridge and cupboard if desired. We don't even have a tree and ZERO family in the area. I would probably start crying if someone actually helped.. I'm tearing up now lol.. Anyways that's our story. Would totally appreciate it and god bless you all anyways.
0	Well, it's Thursday and I am hungry. We get paid on the 15th of every month at my job, and when I looked when I paid all my bills for the first half of the month, I thought the 15th was a Sunday which means we would have got our paychecks tomorrow (Friday since they do not direct deposit on the weekend).  The first half of the month always kills me in bills so I know to be tight with money until I get paid next...well, I didn't expect to not have any money all weekend. Whoops. It is totally my fault though, since I totally looked at the wrong date. Derp.  Anyways, just looking for some dinner tonight that will last over into breakfast/lunch tomorrow, but I am not poor or needy by any stretch of the imagination, **SO THAT MEANS THAT IF THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE POSTING THAT SOUNDS AS IF THEY NEED THIS PIZZA WAY MORE THAN ME, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF CHEESE GIVE IT TO THEM OVER ME!**  I just want to get a pizza today and pay for it once I get paid, so that means if you buy me a pizza, come Monday you can (read: **YOU GOTTA DO IT MAN**) PM me saying *Hey, I bought you that pizza on Thursday, I want my pizza back now bitch."* and you'll have a pizza sent right to your door!  Or, if you're feeling x2 times as generous, email me a link from RAoP that you chose and feel is needing a pizza, and I'll randomly send them a pizza. Pretty much, I feel shitty asking for a pizza tonight because it is just piss poor planning on my part with my pay, so I'd love to just give the pizza back to you next week or give it to someone else you deem is worthy.
1	Hey! My mother's AWOL, and I have no money; the oven's broken, and I'm feeling pretty depressed. I don't want to have to eat a bread-and-butter sandwich for dinner again tonight, and I'd really like a random act of pizza.  Would anyone feel kind enough to buy me a pizza/give me a gift card/code? As stated in the title, I'm in the United Kingdom.  Even if not,  I love you, Reddit. Every single one of you.
0	I'm a hungry and broke college student at FIU in Miami and desperately in need of some food.
1	My coworker and I unfortunately got stuck with the slowest day in over 3 months with nothing to do for the next 5 hours but stand at the desk in case any guests need our attention, but that becomes less likely the later it gets. Any help to feed our hungry low paid stomachs would be very much appreciated. 
1	Just really hungry and I finished off the last of my peanut butter and ramen noodles yesterday. Totally would appreciate some pizza love right now from Reddit.
0	me and my fiancee are a little low on money right now, fear not we shall be able to get a food shop in about 2 weeks. but for now we're kinda bummed out about not having money for the steam sale but some pizza would certainly help lift the mood. can you help us RAOP?
0	I have had Netflix for about 8 months now and ill put you on it for as long as i have it. I am 16,hungry right now with no cash im my pocket lol. I live in sorrento, Florida
1	My wife has a pregnancy craving for pizza...  and we don't have any money at the moment for one.  She just wants a plain cheese pizza.  If we do receive one we will make sure to pay it forward.    Thank you all, you're probably saving my life.
0	My parents just went through a divorce and times have been hard on both my mom and dad. I'm living with my mom now but may have to move to my dads because my mom isn't able to support me and my dad isn't paying child support to my mom. i would love to treat myself to a pizza but i have nearly any money to pay for one, please help me with paying for a pizza! i will return the favor once i am able to!
0	Yeah, my parents are both unemployed and we never ever can afford to actually buy a luxury like pizza. All we have are pantry items, like peas and some cereal. Nothing really good. Haven't had pizza in forever, and i havent eaten for awhile because my sister ate the last of the cereal and the rest of the food is diet food for my mom. All i have, is some little snacks, like grapes. I can draw a pretty picture for you, and put your name on it! (: i can video tape me doing some corny jokes/pickup lines. Willing to do close to anything, im sooo hungry. Im in santa fe springs, california. 
0	More info: My girlfriend has [Celiac Disease](http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/celiac/#what), so we rarely have pizza (Some places do a gluten free crust, but they are a shot in the dark as to quality). She;s out of town for a couple weeks, affording me the rare opportunity to eat all the wheat I want. Unfortunately, I'm unemployed and won't be getting any money until next Friday at the latest. Would love it if someone wanted to help me in my gluten-feast dreams!  Edit: I'm in Los Angeles - Studio City, near Burbank.
1	I know a hard drive sounds like a luxury but I do online classes and there's no way I would have been able to go two weeks without a new one and rent is due tomorrow. I brought all my cash together and have just enough to pay it and my water bill. I know it sounds kind of snooty, but I can't/won't eat ramen. I grew up poor and it was dbreakfast/lunch/and dinner for 5 days out of the week. It turns my stomach now. I understand that I've been pizza'd before but that was over a year ago and I have paid it forward. I would appreciate any help and will be able to return the favor either to you or a person of your choosing, or just a random hungry person. Thanks :)  EDIT: I have posted and received a pizza but at some point in my Reddit career, I deleted all mention of my ex, therefore, I have received before, but I have paid it forward. I deleted it without thinking I would use this subreddit again.
0	Not gonna lie, I could go and buy a pizza for myself and my kids (wife's out of town on business for the next couple of weeks) but I just found this and it's a pretty cool idea so I figured I'd give it a shot!  Garlic Jim's is a little on the pricy-er side, we usually get Papa Murphy's Take'n'Bake, but can't beat the garlicky goodness that is Jim's!  Thanks Reddit!  Edit: As has been pointed out to me, I should have included this: I live in Lynnwood, WA. Thanks again!
1	hey there, first time poster, long time lurker (: i recentlly broke my shoulder, and was told i had to take off work for a while. because of this i have no money coming in; i am broke and quickly running out of food, please help! http://imgur.com/pmafe &lt;-- me p.s. im currently living in the windy city!! (chicago il)
0	Hey everybody , as I opened my fridge I realized that I have nothing for dinner! Can someone help a pizza lover out?
0	I'm a student living in Boston and I've been terribly sick for the last couple of days. Cold stuff, nothing huge but it's made me miss class which is very annoying.  Being feverish and cold-stricken I'd like to turn the radiator on but the landlord insists on not turning the boiler on until late October. This is New England where things get super cold super fast. I am one of those things and the blankets aren't cutting it. :/  Because of the first couple weeks of classes, I haven't had a chance to grocery shop extensively, only buying fruits and cereal and bread what have you. I've now exhausted all of that. Now I'm out of money too, so I can't even get take out.  I do have money put away for college, but my mother back home insists on regulating it for me. She's probably right to do so, however her boyfriend surprised her with a trip to the carribean. Meaning, now I need money from my account, but can't have it transfered because she is away.  Today's just a shit day: I'm sick, I'm cold, and my money is just out of reach.  May I please have a pizza so I can lay on it to stay warm/eat it while sobbing?
1	   [request] SAP in [California] comes to you in her time of pizza need.  So I am more of a lurker and I know it makes me look bad but I have been here nearly three years and I hope that gives me some credit. (I am great at run-on sentences).   My little family of two and one cat would love to indulge in a pizza. We have been going through some tough times recently. We just paid the rent and now have 24$ to our name. We are going to do whatever we can to have it hold us over until Wednesday. A pizza is not a necessity but it would be a real treat.   In exchange I can offer pictures of my adorable cat Charlie (he has plenty of food so there are no worries there) and a promise to pay it forward as soon as I can.   Thank you Random_Acts_Of_Pizza!
0	Hey! So I just moved across the country for school. I had a job during the summer, but I just spent every last dime (and maxed out my credit cards) to pay rent/gas for the drive/utilities. I don't get my last paycheck until the 1st on Monday. I won't even have Internet/cable until I get loan disbursements in a month (phoneposting... sigh)  The only food I have available is a cup of butterscotch candies the complex gave me. I'd really appreciate any help I can get. 
1	Hey r/Random_acts_of_pizza, I don't normally ask for this sort of thing, but money is super tight right now, and we're down to our last pound of hamburger. Me and my girlfriend won't have a chance to get food again until the 5th, and after hamburger based food for the past week or so, we're sick of it.  So what I'm putting up on the table is, my girlfriend is an excellent artist. She mostly does anime, and stuff, but she's amazing at what she does.   For proof, [Picture 1](http://i.imgur.com/QvLL5.jpg), [Picture 2, WIP](http://i.imgur.com/mPF5B.jpg)  If you'd like to buy us a medium pie, She will gladly do a piece of art for you, anything you want.(Minus "Mecha") :D  Thanks for browsing, and I hope you have a wonderful day!  **EDIT: Oopsies! We're in Murfreesboro, TN. :D**
1	My boyfriend and i both lost our jobs within a week of eachother.  All money we have been able to make goes towards rent.   Is there anyway someone on reddit can help us? Even just someting small will be great!
0	Hi, thanks for reading. My husband and I just have had to close our company down due to the economy and to be honest we are barely making it by on Public Assistance for the first time ever. We have 4 great kids who have made the best out of a kind of bummer summer and we would love to surprise them with Pizza and a movie. It would be great as the summer is coming to an end and would love a night of smiles. Thanks again for reading.
1	Been fending off this bug for about a week and it has finally caught up to me. So I am at home, feeling crummy and losing money. Don't have the energy to cook and would be eternally grateful for a pie. 
0	Hungry in Waterloo, Ontario here. Will eat anything besides ramen =/  EDIT: can pay back in about a weeks time
0	I hope I am doing this correctly. I do not have any  tear jerker story. Husband is working a double , children got their shots today and I would love to get pizza for them, it's not within our budget Thank you for taking the time consider my request We are a family of 5 but all i really care about if if the children are treated since they were quite brave. I will treat others to some pizza when my budget sees fit.
0	So, I won't bore you with the gruesome details. Last night, I had a really good time with some friends, and this morning, the charming head of mental illness decided to punch the good times clean out of me. I was awful to the people that I love, and now I'm on my own, too frightened out of my mind of what they think of me to talk to anybody. I probably don't deserve this, but I just need to eat something - I haven't been able to in a few days, and my stomach is making some ungodly noises.  I wouldn't normally ask, but my bank account is already in overdraft, and I don't ask for much - I have a usual order, and it comes to just over a fiver. If anyone could help, I will definitely pay it forward should you ever be in need. God knows, I've got plenty to make up for.
0	Title says it all. Cupboard is low on food. I`m tired, wasn't supposed to work today but Chef decided to give his pet Czech the day off and called me into work in his place. My co-worker rambled about the joys of cold pizza for like an hour so its all I can think about but, I am broke for a week. I will of course pay it forward once I have money. I used to send my GF pizzas while she was down in New Mexico at university, so this is just a broader spectrum of hungry hungry hippies to share with.
1	She is very pregnant and our son is sick with an earache.   It's hot, everyone is tired,  we would go crazy for a pizza.   EDIT:  Thank you so much for the offers,  we are incredibly grateful.   You guys are fantastic!  
1	I'll be hosting a Stargate Marathon this Tuesday, and I've already invested over 70 bucks in it, so if anyone could contribute a pizza, it'd help out a lot.  Do note that I'm not starving or anything, I could simply use a hand in organizing this thing, specially since Pizza is the stereotypical Media Marathon food. Please do help others in dire need before sending me a pie.
0	Tried a few contests this morning. Had a blast!! Hoping someone wants to randomly offer up a pizza. If that is you, then we can be your random choice!!  well, thats it, no dragging story to go along with it. Just home with kids and would love to feed them some pizza. Thanks for looking!!:)
0	I've heard of Random Acts of Pizza but never actually used it.  Right now it's getting into the later afternoon and I gotta say...I'm tired.  Payday is tomorrow and my stomach is hating the ramen I've been eating the last few days.  It would honestly make my entire day to have a filling, hot meal tonight.  I would love to pay it forward as soon as I have money in hand.    Can anyone help me out?  EDIT:  Aw crud, I'm such a noob.  I left my location out of the title.  Sorry guys.  I'm in Bakersfield, California
0	I don't have a steady job right now and I've been doing odd jobs to get by. I'm home alone for the next month by myself because my dad is traveling for company who hired him for a month of solid work which is awesome and my mom is away visiting her mom. I've been doing everything I can to make some money recently because I'm trying to visit my girlfriend who is down in Florida right now. I'm planning to go out and see her just after my birthday on the 27th and need to have as much as possible to be able to stay in a hotel (where she is staying you're not allowed to have guests overnight) and to eat and pay for the plane ticket back. So, I ask you Random Acts of Pizza, could you spare a few dollars for a pizza for an early birthday present?  Here is a photo of me and my refrigerator: http://imgur.com/35cpf  Feel free to ask me anything and I will definitely take pictures to thank you for the pizza! 
1	I have been unemployed for about six months and recently my dog has had numerous health issues that have led to thousands of dollars in vet bills. I have fallen behind on my mortgage in order to help try and save her. She is slowly doing better but still needs daily medications that I am struggling to pay for. I know to many people it may seem crazy to sacrifice so much for a dog, but she really is my baby. I would appreciate a pizza to help give me some comfort during this difficult time, as I have no family near me either. Thanks for your consideration.
0	Thanks! It's friday night and we're hungry and watching Star Trek.  Edit: I'm verified
0	No sob story here, just two guys hanging out plaing some NHL 12, looking to have a pizza. I've been a member for a bit now and will return the favour next weekend!
0	I have a huge load of home work to do today, and have no hot food to make myself in my house. Absolutely craving a pizza, but I have no money.
0	Someone help a hungry college student away from home get dinner for tonight. I just started my job three weeks ago and won't get paid till this friday. I ran out of food three days ago. Before I got to that point, I was only eatin ramen and canned meats. Please someone help remind me how Pizza tastes. I will greatly appreciate it.
0	Title says it all, ha. Being sick just really sucks, but pizza for dinner sounds fantastic.
0	(Bay Area, California) I just lost my job about a month ago. I'm at 0 in savings. A friend told me about this. I just want to eat some dinner. Hope everyones having a great day.
0	I don't have a sob story, i'm just hungry and have nothing but condiments in my home after a poorly budgeted month. A single pizza could get me through the last few days before I get paid again. I hope to pay forward RAoP's generosity as soon as I can, but I need help. Thanks for considering. 
0	So by a series of bad timing and bureaucratic paperworkery my unemployment benefits are in limbo. I haven't had benefits for a month, when I should have (they're reviewing my case, which is standard procedure but they're behind so their 2 week time frame has morphed into a five week time frame), I'm just frustrated and broke, but I should be getting money monday (finally), and a pizza could feed me all weekend.  I hope this doesn't sound too much like begging. If it doesn't happen it doesn't happen. Of course when I'm back on my feet I will pizza this forward to someone who needs it at that time.
1	I'm using my real account, and it shames me that it's come to this.      Last Friday I had to do something no one ever wants to do, I had to phone my mom and dad to ask for money. I have not lost my job, but my car's exhaust broke. For those familiar with cars, the clamp where the catalytic converter and exhaust meet up rusted through, and the rust had damaged the pipes and cat under the car. The shop's bill came to $320 and some change, to replace the rusted pipes/cat and weld up the connections.      Let me say that I'm not in a dire situation, my parents were able to lend me enough to cover my overdraft fee and most of my rent, but I've nothing left for food. I have enough frozen burritos to survive, but a warm pizza would be amazing.      Back to the escapism of videogames for the time being.
0	Request: I am trying to have a party tonight because my mom and sister are out of town. I am just a broke college student and I'm being honest I want pizza. I am not a sob story... I have a pretty easy going life and love pizza!
0	I posted earlier but I forgot to tag it, my boyfriend comes home from work in three hours and we are broke until friday. It would make his night to have pizza!!! 
0	I would like to request someone to send a pizza to my mom. She and my dad divocred (it was final las Friday) she has been having a rough time and could use some encouragement! It would be a blessing to not have to worry about dinner for one night for her, my sister, and brother.   I know alot of people will wonder why don't I do it myself... well I don't have the money for that. My husband and I are currently living paycheck to paycheck like many others, currently only on my income, due to layoffs.  Thanks!  P.S. to all of those out there that are able to give and help those in need and encourage people- you are all blessings from heaven!! It's so great to see that gracious people still exist in the world. 
0	He just started a new job and has to wait until the 1st for his first paycheck. I'm trying to do something to make his day, but we're both broke until he gets paid on the 1st. If anyone wants to help me put a smile on his face, that'd be awesome!
0	Just got home with family 3 kids and fiance. Fridge is dead food spoiled and dont have money on us. Please suprise us. Only have pizza hut in little town. Thanks
0	economy sucks here and ive been out of work for 2 years after moving over here, could go for a thin n crispy 
0	I've been in school for a few weeks and my food stores are running low, and can't be filled up again until my loans come in. If somebody can gift me a pizza today I will 'today you, tomorrow me' this weekend!
0	I found an article in CNN about raop while stumbling and it was like a sign. I've seen reddit before but never made an account so this is a good a time as any. Me and my daughter are going through some rough times. I'm single and work my ass off in a school cafeteria for minimum wage to try and make ends meet. I'm pretty broke right now and I really don't know if I can do rent even. I hate not being able to provide everything to my kid because of circumstance. Our food stamps haven't come in yet so we're pretty much out of food. I really don't know what I'm going to feed Lexie for lunch. If some kind stranger could help us out with a pizza it would be very appreciated. 
1	Dad is currently looking for a job and they keep telling him to wait longer before they offer and we're living from unemployment check to unemployment check. Not a lot of food around the house and I don't want him to have to worry about food for at least one day.
0	I've planned a fun evening for us, but a surprise pizza would be really amazing! I will of course pay this forward when I am able to :)
1	It's my birthday, and I'm spending it hungry, alone, broke, amd homeless. I don't really want to ask for much, but I'm so hungry and I haven't eaten anything but dry cheerios for the past two days, and I just found out of this place. If anyone could help me, god, I would be so thanlful and appreciative. Anything I could do to return the favor or pay it forward, I swear I will do. Cause I mean, I know how it is, everyone has low points and needs help sometimes.
0	My mom was recently in a car accident, and she's been having shoulder/neck/back problems that she has to get MRI's done for and she has to visit her doctor frequently. My parents usually supply me with some money when they can, but I rejected their offer this time because their $20 copays are piling up and they barely have any food in the cupboards themselves, so they need the money much more than I do. This is my first post on here, and I realize there may be people that need food much more than I do, so please help them first. Pizza would last me a few days. God bless. 
0	We're in Tampa Florida...moving to Ybor on Friday. My email is usfstuff@yahoo.com, since I'm having major trouble figuring out reddit's message system.   My two roommates and I have found a new place to live and are moving in on Friday. The rent is $1100 including utitilies and internet. My 2 roomies have very nicely offered for me to just pay $200 a month until I have a job. I am so thankful to have them as friends! This month all of us are extremely poor from paying $2000 to landlord (first+last rent+deposit). We also had to pay $310 for TECO to turn on the electricity.   I would just really love to do something nice for them and pick them up a pizza and a sub/pzone. My one roomie doesn't love pizza and she only ever gets a sub/pzone haha. Using a few coupons, I can get 8 pizza rollers, 1 large pizza, and a pzone for $11 from Pizza Hut. If anyone can help me out I would be so grateful! Pizza Hut is just the cheapest, if you have something else in mind let me know. I have an interview on Thursday so keep your fingers crossed!   The pic for our huge TECO deposit :/ http://imgur.com/B0uoo
0	just asking its 7.50 cause of deal and would feed me and my little brother 
1	Hi my fellow redditors. Stuck in a college dorm at my uni in Grand Junction Colorado. It's been a rough year for my parents and I wasnt able to travel home for the holidays. Would be awesome to enjoy a yummy pizza with my roomie who is in the same boat. Happy holidays to each and all.
0	I'm so hungry and I'm sick of having to only eat beans and tuna sandwiches, My dad works all day and my mom... well shes not in a good place so I have no money right now and I'm gonna starve. :( please.
1	My autistic nephew had his 15th birthday yesterday. I bought him some Dora The Explorer DVDs for him.   On my way home from work I stopped by Walmart to grab a frozen pizza but was declined at the register.   There's a Soul Food fund raiser at work tomorrow where I can eat, and then I get paid on Thursday. However tonight I've got nothing.  I'm requesting just a basic pizza to eat tonight with some slices I can save for breakfast. Since I get paid on Thursday I can totally pay it forward. It would really help me out guys, and I'd really like to return the favor.   Thanks for taking the time to read this. And my nephew loved the DVDs. His sister looks like Dora, so he gets very excited when watching them since he cant live with his 'real' family. He's a former student of my sister who took him in from his parents who couldn't take care of him. Long story, but I don't mind answering any questions about it. 
0	I live in Goodyear, AZ.  I can receive pizza at an address nearby, however i got kicked out by my boyfriend today because we had a huge argument, sadly, he is the one that makes the money, i am a stay at home mom, he is watching 2 kids right now, i miss them and i want to go home, kind of desperate for pizza :) hopefully i get my wish :).
0	Hey all,  This is my first time using this and honestly I feel a bit guilty for even requesting after reading some of the stories on here.. Some of you guys are much worse off than I and my heart goes out to you. :(  Nevertheless, this has been the week from hell. I'm sick with the flu, I have an (also sick) 5 month old, lots of exams due, and $5.98 in my bank account (yes, I can take a screen shot and show you if you'd like). I've been too sick (and little one is too sick to be taking to the grocery store!) and too poor to even get adult groceries for myself in a couple of weeks, (but we still have a healthy supply of yummies for the little one, so no worries there! Little ones always come first! &lt;3)  Honestly, I'm just sick, broke, worn out and hungry. I'd be happy to repay the favor. I love helping people out :) So if anyone could find it in their heart to help me out with a pizza or two (yay for maybe having cold pizza breakfast tomorrow too!) I'd be the happiest little camper ever.   &lt;3's!
1	I am not starving, I do not NEED this, and I can well afford some pizza because I live at home. But I want to participate and would absolutely pay it forward for the fun of it. I think the only place near here is Dominoes, and my GF will be coming over in a few hours and we are going to just watch a movie, hopefully with pizza lol.
0	We are three hungry girls in Brooklyn, jealous of our cats enjoying Friskies Grilled Mix that we spent our last collective $8.49 on. We don't get paid until tomorrow evening! We saw this on a new report a while ago, so we aren't exactly sure how to use it, but it sounds like all you have to do is return the favor! We can do it tomorrow! Can any kind soul help out there?? Attached below is my bank account to prove it! It's been a rough week!  Thanks so much and we love you!  -Chelsea, Elsie, Mel(sea), and the cats  http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/219/mylovelybankaccount.jpg/
0	Today I ran out of money and would really like a pizza, it's been a long week and it's only Tuesday! Will provide sob story upon demand :)
0	Would like a pizza sent to our awesome System Admin for all of his hard work. I cannot do this yet since the bills are kind of tight and I'm low on funds. If this is fulfilled I will return the favor as soon as I am able to. Thanks!
0	Not even sure how this works, kind of feels weird just asking for someone i don't know to give me something, but... this does exists... so something Vegetarian would be awesome. :)
0	We're just sitting here near indianapolis on our nights off, wishing we had something other than poptarts to eat tonight. Just pulled a double at work but there is no room in the budget to splurge. Groceries this week consisted of tuna and white bread...and I'm pretty damn tired of tuna at this point. We're pretty nice people so we're hoping karma will help us out! We promise to post a special [thank you] and pay it forward ASAP!!
0	Had some issues come up this week, I can pay it forward when I get paid on Friday! &lt;3   I should add that Domino's is preferred.  Thanks :)  EDIT: AVW sent me a giftcard. Thanks so much! *hugs*
0	Just spent a small fortune at the doctors office and the drug store.  Could really use a pizza pie for supper and to brighten the day.  We don't get more cash until next Wed.  But will gladly return the favor then for a pie tonight.
1	I am 19 weeks pregnant and I am home alone.  Lunch was minimal and I spent the day at a camp in the heat chasing 5 year olds.  We don't get paid until the end of the session, which is in 3 weeks.  Thank you for reading and for your consideration.
0	Starving student, just making it by, have a few finals tomorrow and some pizza would help me get to sleep without hunger pangs and would allow me to have a little something to eat before my tests!
0	I know, I know, I only just registered so I must be lying. Hopefully someone can not prejudge me and possibly believe me.   Anyway... I heard about this site from one of my online friends, who is in a similar financial situation as me. I was supposed to be paid on Monday, however due to some issues with my bank I haven't been paid and am not really sure when I will be paid. This leaves me with a current balance of Â£2.36 on my debit card (I can provide proof). I ate the last of my food tonight, so I was hoping to get a pizza from here tomorrow. If any more information is needed then feel free and I will post on here or over PM.  Thanks in advance everyone.
0	In MA near Boston. Will most definitely pay it forward when my paycheck comes in. 
0	I am really craving some Hawaiian or bbq chicken and avocado pizza
0	you know how good pizza is when you're drunk!! holler at a girl and if you're in the area i'll save you some for breakfast tomorrow
0	Im not exactly bad off, just dont have any money for food, just me and my brother here, im 18 he is 13, ya know... growin men and stuff. any help would be great and ill pizza it forward when ever i get a chance!
0	Hello everyone (anyone?), how are you guys?  I've never posted on here but I could really use some help.  I have basically no money right now thanks to rent being awful, but I will tomorrow thanks to pay day!  Honestly, I would have no problem just being kind of hungry today but I have to study for a midterm all day/night and my hunger is becoming very distracting :\    Blah, I hate posting an annoyingly self pitying story like that but that's my situation and I could really use some help.  I was really hesitant to post this, because as a lurker I have no karma.  I only really upvote/downvote so if you want confirmation that I'm a hardcore reddit addict I can send you a screenshot of the liked tab on my profile!    Well, that's that!  So thanks for helping, thanks for reading, thanks for being cool :P  edit: and oh god to explain my username, its an inside joke as that was my first AOL screenname!
0	Me and my roomate are out of cash and food, I will get more cash next week but It would be amazing if one of you would send cash for a pizza. (We live in Latvia so I don't know if you can send a pizza directly.)
0	I am a poor, hungry college student, but I have the skills to fix this! I am looking for something to eat tomorrow night (Friday, 9/21) and am willing to do engineering/math problems for food!  I am a fifth year Mechanical Engineering student, so I am fairly steeped in many areas of knowledge.  PS: If you want something else, like a funny picture of a pony, I would be happy to oblige. :)
0	I'm indulging myself by spending the weekend doing nothing but reading The Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson. A 1007 page fantasy epic. I'm about 250 pages in already and just realized that I'm hungry. Now I'm afraid I'm too sucked into the story to take a half hour away from the book to make something to eat and I lack the orbs* to order food brought to me. So I throw myself at the internet's mercy. Be kind and send pizza before I die of an engaging plot.  *chips of gemstones suspended in glass balls used as currency in the book.
0	I recently just joined Reddit! I heard about this service...and my title writes itself. I honestly think this is to good to be true. I'm chillin with my folks in Stafford, TX and [no sob story] I dont always order pizza... "BUT WHEN I DO I MAKE SURE IT'S THE MOST INTERESTING ORDER EVER" School resumes for me on Tuesday, and to go back to my friends with a story of how I got pizza sounds sort of ecstatic to me! LOL Meat lovers anyone?
1	Howdy out there, just a simple request; my mom is staying late tonight in an attempt to get ahead at the first of the month, and was wondering if I could get some pizza for my brother, sister and I. I would normally do something like this myself, but I haven't been able to nail down a job and between the three of us, there is about six dollars to split. :P If anyone could help out, I would greatly appreciate it.
0	First and foremost this is a throwaway, with that being said I am willing to provide more verification then most people asking. (Pictures of me and the pizza, a phone number, etc)  I just moved back to this city, I have my mother coming to bring me food on tuesday and I did not eat yesterday. I do have a job and a place to live but that is really the extent of it, just looking for food. Yesterday I used my last few dollars to get a pizza special and some noodles, I really would prefer to not eat these noodles now.  I prey someone out there has a kind heart, R'amen
0	After a long and last-minute move out of our apartment into a new apartment that we really can't afford (long story), we accidentally kicked a hole in the drywall while moving our last boxes.   Bit of panic later, the girlfriend is currently ZipCar-ing to Home Depot to try to find parts before they close. I told her I would get food--but little does she know I only have $38 in my bank account until **next** Monday. http://i.imgur.com/ceUN6Ht.png  TL;DR - My dumb little sob story. :-/  
0	Hey, I figure this is a long shot, never tried anything like this before. Here goes, I am a student at HCC, because of student loans, I have literally no money for food. Haven't had a hot meal in 4 days. My food stamps come in next week, but until then, I was hoping for a little something to nibble on.
0	Look, we're not starving, but we all forgot/don't have our credit cards with us and could use a nice pie. Some help would be nice. Here's some bullshit reasons why we really deserve it though:  -We're in a band.  -We just watched The Big Lebowski.  -We have a dog named Cooper.   [Here's us three](http://i.imgur.com/qhdt2.jpg) looking super content with our middle-class living conditions (I'm the sorta black dude).  We probably aren't as qualified as other unfortunate subscribers here, though this IS *random* acts of pizza anyway! I also can't really promise this since I'm just another internet citizen, but if someone gives us pizza, I'll make sure to pay it forward soon when my new credit card comes in.  Even if we get nothing and are downvoted to hell, props to this wonderful community and like I said, I look forward to being a contribution some time soon.  Oh!, and here's Sergio [looking sexy as fuck](http://i.imgur.com/TaikH.jpg).
0	Moving has sapped my bank accounts. I'm not starving or anything, but I've been eating nothing but peanut butter and jelly sandwhiches since Monday, and that's getting pretty old.   Is there a stranger that can help me eat something different tonight?  My paycheck doesn't get deposited until tomorrow, at which point I will certainly pay it forward.   Also, I am new to this subreddit. I think I understand how it all works, but bear with me. I am happy to provide verification/etc.
1	I'm looking to get some pizza for my day off. I posted to /r/loans first, cause I would like to either pay the person back or pay it forward. I don't get paid until the weekend, so that's when I will be paying it back/forward.   I worked two 12 hour shifts back to back and I'm looking for some pizza to relax with. Thanks in advance if you can help :D  Edit: 1 day later, could still use some pizza. Sure hope I get paid today :s
0	So its pretty much what I stated in my title. I'm a relatively poor college kid making a living on Ebay buying/selling/refurbishing iPhones and other electronics. This month didn't go so well and I don't have money until my next paypal payment is processed. (Can provide proof of this)  In return I can fix/root/upgrade/whatever your cell phone or other personal electronic or draw you a really bad picture! I could also be your lane-mate in Dota 2 (I play a mean Omniknight)  If you can't give pizza an internet high five would also do the trick!
1	It's been a rough couple of weeks. Found out last week that the guy I've been seeing has a girlfriend. Then found out today that it's going to cost almost 200$ for a medical procedure I need for my stomach. I really could use a little bit of cheesy cheer.  As soon as I can pay it forward I will!
0	hello thank you for taking time to read my post, my name is stephanie and i live with my fiance and our 2 dogs. We do have our own place but are back on rent 5mths and about to be evicted. we both lost our jobs because we only had one car and the tires were really bad so cpl mths ago when it was raining an we wrecked totaling the car. its just been a really hard cpl of mths and with no food or money a pizza would be great. and we would also share a piece with our dogs who to us are our kids. we live in Bedford PA-814-623-9913
0	Hi raop'ers, I'm a bit hungry and I just thought I'd try this out and see if I get lucky. Thanks :)
0	Firstly thanks RAOP for existing. I love reading other people's pizza'd experience.   I started a new job as a baker for Stop n Shop after not having a steady one for the past three years. I absolutely love working due to my natural high energy level, so it's awesome! However my body is adjusting to the activity level which is one of the highest in my life - I also dance daily since I found rhythmic movement is necessary for me to regulate my emotions and impulses. However since I'm broke due to screwing up my landlady's dirt patch and rent being due, I'm on the beans/ramen/seitan diet which I don't actually mind at all except I dropped six pounds in the past week and every muscle in my body hurts in a new way. I can't afford used clothes from the thrift store anytime this month unless I get birthday money, can't afford to take the bus home, and I don't get paid til Thursday.   The pizza wouldn't just be for me. Fortunately I live with two wonderful supportive lovers (closed poly triad). My bf helped me out giving me a lift home a couple times because cars beep at me and people yell stuff while walk home from work exhausted :( Our gf is in chronic pain and feeling depressed due to trying to be a bio major after going through two windshields and injuring her ankle BAD on the job when I met her. I would love to cheer her up with cheesy goodness, since they are also broke.  Thanks RAOP!
0	My husband doesn't get paid until Friday, and until then we have no money.  I took the week off to study for MCAT, and now I regret taking the time off. If you're in Tucson, I'd be willing to trade some pizza for some...adult herb?
1	We recently lost a job in the family and are now having to make a quick move back to Oregon. We've overdrawn our bank accounts and our cupboards are quite barren.   We have PAX LoL champion codes and Wreck-It Ralph avatar item codes to offer in return for delicious pizza. 
1	So, long story short, today has been a really crappy day. Unfortunately, it's going to continue to be crappy until the 5th when I get my first paycheck from my new job working night shifts. I would love to turn this day around with some pizza, and I'll be paying it forward as soon as I get the paycheck. 
0	My reddit cake day!
0	Job hunting, but finally ran out of money last week.  First time asking for a handout....feels weird.....reddit was the first place i felt comfortable asking.....living in Asheville, nc.  Just cheese would be more than appreciated by me and my girlfriend, nothing fancy, just hungry......  :(:
0	im so sick of eating eggs all day. I wish i had some RAMEN to eat so i could combine if with my eggs. I'm completely broke and hungry. Starving college kid in need.
1	Hi. My name is denise. I am a 65 year old disabled veteran. I suffer from agent orange among many other things. I am coming to you today to request a random act of pizzas to fill my belly. My money ran out quick this month and I don't have food for today. My favorite pizza is pizza hut. I do plan on returning the favor when I can afford it. I was referred to this site by my grand daughter.
0	Recently heard of this site through the media and I was wonder if you could deliver a pizza to a dear friend of mine, she's starving because her schoolwork has piled so high that she doesn't have time for a job. If possible, I'd like my name to somehow get through to her..
0	Basically I am a university student and I was hit by an unexpected utility bill and a requirement to pay a retainer on the property that I am moving in to next year for over the summer...these two things have cleaned me out! I am flying out to America with an organisation that places us in summer camps on the 16th but until then I have only 49 pence in my account! If any kind redditor can assist, let me know... 
0	Pretty much what the title says, I'm broke, my fridge is empty until Friday, and pancakes are really starting to get old. Hoping maybe one of you kind folks will send me some pizza to get me through the evening.   thanks in advance if you do! â¥
1	I'm 30 weeks pregnant and desperately craving pizza, but I can't really justify spending the money on it while I'm saving up for the baby's arrival.  If anyone wants to help me out it would be incredible! 
0	Happy to pay it forward on friday :) Columbus, ohio here.
1	I've been eating nothing but ramen and *extremely* cheap frozen dinners for the past three weeks (jobless, looking.) and it'd just be nice to eat something that rises above the blandness of my current diet. I'm in Tucson, AZ and there's both a dominos and a pizza hut by my house.  EDIT: Pastafarian sent me a generous dominoes gift card (I'll be sure to get pizza with my youngest brother (he's in summer school and his hours at work have been cut) all this week :) ) and Bluehairedfreak ordered a delivery before he/she got my message regarding pastafarian so I got pizza for tonight as well. Thank you so much to both of you; you're great people.
1	Cooking dinner for one is a difficult task and since I'm alone I'd love to lay on the couch, watch netflix and have a pizza. Will pay it forward on the 15th (payday.)
1	Any will do, we're all just so hungry. I heard about RAOP from the Culture of Reddit video, and this part touched me big time. Hoping to see if Reddit will help us out- we're sure to return the favor when we get some money. 
0	Hey, RAoP! Just hanging out with a friend before I leave for school in England! A free pizza would totally make the night!
0	Anyone mind on sending a special pizza over to Belgium? Would loooooove to try something different than the normal ham, cheese stuff... ;-) Also, I'll keep looking out for RAOP's to help in Belgium.
1	Edit: iEatPie got me.  
1	Like the title says, I plan on eating some ramen and frozen veggies, but a nice pizza would be great. Papa johns is close by, but I don't think either of the other big companies can deliver. 
1	If anyone could help me and my girlfriend out it would be amazing and we would pay it forward when we get back on our feet. Both unemployed at the moment in a new city. We have managed to cover rent and bills for the month, but at the expense of nice food and quality of life. ANY type of nice food would go a long way if anyone can help us out and will repay the favour to other worthy redditors ASAP.
0	Just could really use a pizza. 
0	needing pizza to help feed my 3 young cousins and keep them quiet so I can focus on the RWC! Can anyone help?
0	Lack of time and income limit me to cook or order dinner as I have 3 exams and 3 assignments due in the next 5 days. I am a pizza head by nature and would love to relax and enjoy a delicious pizza while studying! Definitely will pay it forward in the near future! 
1	title really says it all. Lots of tests, projects, and other assorted details to crank out over the next 2 and a half weeks.
0	My family went to peru and i have to take care of the dogs while there gone, i have run out of food and have no money to buy any. (ontario, canada)
0	I've never been this happy in years. Yesterday, I finally made it to school for the first time in 2 years. I have social phobia and depression and I would never even step foot outside my apartment, even to walk my dog. After years of therapy and medication, I somehow managed to gather up my courage and start a new life for myself.      I would love to celebrate with a pizza! I really wish I could provide proof, but I'm not sure how I can prove this kind of stuff. I can say, however that I live in NY.     Thank you all so much for even reading this, I really appreciate it.  Much love &lt;3  edit: formatting
0	SO finally after months of working part time and interviewing I was offered my dream job.  I've come to reddit a lot the last few months looking for  advice and entertainment.    I'm just about through my savings so the next few weeks until I get that first paycheck are going to be really really tough.  I'd love to celebrate with a pizza tonight instead of the standard issue ramen/spaghetti.  I can post a picture of something and most certainly will pay it forward once that first paycheck comes in.  THANKS GUYS   EDIT: I live in the western subs of Philly
1	Tomorrow is his 5 birthday and I want to do something to celebrate it. Im not old enough to get a job (14) and my dad has no money :( Will someone help me out? God bless however took the time to read this, and have a good day everyone.
1	I'm a pizza guy (I know, the irony..) and while I was at work last week someone pulled out in front of me and I t-boned them. We were both ok, but a few days later I found out she doesn't have insurance (She gave the officer a expired or fake card) and is apparently off the grid. Long story short, I haven't been able to work all week and I won't be getting any form of money until sometime next week.   I can give proof of my situation if wanted, but I don't want to post the accident report for all to see. 
0	I'm tired, sweaty and hungry and I don't want to turn on the oven in this heat.  I could draw you a picture or something but I can't promise you that it would be any good. Or I could send you a picture of me, super happy and eating pizza.
0	Left my GF of two years and moved into a new place, but spent most of my paycheck paying the first months rent. Have less than $15 to my name. Friend was supposed to help me with groceries, but she hasn't received the money from her loan yet, so I'm out of luck until then, or until my next paycheck, which is the friday after next, nearly two weeks away.   I was hoping someone could help me out, and in return I will mail you one of my [prints](http://imgur.com/a/S5q1Y) when I am financially able. The print would be of your choice. 
0	Hi we are a family of five its just me and four girls. I work at a daycare living paycheck to paycheck. So we hardly ever get to afford pizza. I have good kids and i feel that they deserve to get a chance to taste fresh pizza. thank you for your time and consideration
1	Hey Redditors, I'll try and keep it short. I've been broke for quite some time with just enough money to pay for rent. I recently got a job, working I.T., but I wont see a check until the end of the month. My sob story isn't all that bad, i'm glad to finally have a job! I just don't have any money yet for any food.  I was just wondering if /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza would be willing to help me through this Saturday night.  Edit: Thanks Numb3rs4 for the kind words. Also, here's some proof. I hate looking in my fridge. http://imgur.com/2Hkchis
1	I'm broke for another two weeks and so dang hungry for some good eats. I paid my rent today, and got my phone turned back on, and now I've got nada to last me until my next check. Not to mention, I owe some money to the bank due to some ridiculous overdraft fees that I did not intentionally incur. My rent check was cashed by my landlord really late, after I thought he'd already taken it out a while back. I had to ask my roommate to cover the utility bills until I can pay my half later (I'll be sharing the possible pizza with her too, she's an angel).   I'm steadily working on a film my friends and I are making, which I love, but buying supplies for what I want/need to do along with paying my bills has left me in a bit of a rut. Frankly, I fucked up on my budget. I have an interview for a second job tomorrow, which I'm pretty stoked about.   Other than that, I love pizza, so naturally Random_Acts_Of_Pizza is freaking awesome. If someone meets my request, I'll pay you back or someone else once I get back on my feet in a few weeks, no problem.  
0	This last couple months have been hard for me and my grandpa, early in June my grandma passed away and although we've been managing to get by but it hasn't been easy. Other than when the occasional family member brings over some food we've mostly been living off ramen and sandwich meats until one of us can find a job. (Previously we stayed home because of my grandma and our funds came through her from the state)  Could really just use a pizza to boost morale for me and my grandpa.  
1	I do not get paid until tuesday and my little brother and I (we live independent from our parents for personal reasons) have been living off ramen and bologna sandwiches. I feel bad for him because he is home alone with no tv or pc :/ i am at my work computer and a coworker told me about this site and thats why i have a new account. I have proof if you need it (including my negative bank account). Please any help would be appreaciated!!
0	Hey,  It's been a rough week and I'm tired of eating rice and ramen. A pizza would sure hit the spot. I live in Dublin/Ireland.  Thanks
0	Would greatly appreciate it, sucks seeing her so bummed out.
0	So my bank card mysteriously stopped working.  And  so I cant withdraw cash.  I sent a message to the bank but they wont get back to me for 24 hours.  Basically I havent eaten today.  I have to get off the hostel computer so I cant stick around so please post in the comments if you decide to help me out so other users know.  IÂ´m staying at Hostal Forestal, Coronel Santiago Bueras 122, Santiago de Chile and my name is Nick.  This subreddit is amazing by the way!
0	Hi, RAoPizza'ers! Just as it says above, I'm an unemployed recent college graduate with loans on top of loans to pay. There's nothing to eat at my house, and I sure am awfully hungry. If anyone would be willing to buy me a pizza, I would be so extremely appreciative, and would repay your kind deed once I get back on my feet. If it's any motivation, here is a picture of me about to eat a piece of paper (and verification that I'm not a scammer or troll):   http://imgur.com/mCbMmxn  Thank you for reading! This would make my week. 
0	EDIT: Disregard, girl invited me to BBQ.  See you in a month, I'll still send out the pizzas.  All alone on fathers day sucks more than I thought it would.  I don't need much, just a small cheese from someone who cares to cheer me up.  I don't have enough $ for pizza and the gas I'll need to work my shitty job.    I've never done this before but if I get something I'll send out two pizzas next month in your honor.
0	Im in a hard spot used up all of my last paycheck on bills and have less than two [dollars] (http://imgur.com/nP2kmrs) for these next 5 days had to use the last of my money for gas. Pizza from anywhere would be appreciated thank you &gt;.&lt;
0	I have my bank account information here. I usually don't ask for this, but any help would be appreciated. Thank you so much.   http://i.imgur.com/yMtb3.png
0	Two college students studying for finals week, was going to make a box of Kraft Mac and Cheese but am all out of milk and already had eggs once today. Any help would be paid forward when work study checks come in. 
1	[relevant source as to why I would ask total strangers for pizza](http://i.imgur.com/nhCti.png)  I'm a little down on my luck for a few days and if anyone can spare the charity of a sausage/pepperoni pizza, it'd be well appreciated. Thank you for your time and happy holidays.   I live in North Georgia, near Berry College. I made a throwaway at first, but the peeps in the RAOP chatroom told me it'd be more genuine if I posted on my main. It's a little embarrassing to ask, but all I ask for is charity in exchange for my humility. 
0	My girlfriend of 5 years just cheated on me... fuck. I have no money. Shit.
0	No food til Saturday and could use a yummy pizza. Anyone willing to help??
0	Single mom, 2 kids, laid off, no food stamps yet, don't even have bread or milk...my life sucks. I feel like a shitty mom. 
1	I'm not due to go back to my job until next week. I've been off for hand surgery. I'm broke, my temporary food stamps have run out until the 10th, and my parents can't put $20 into my account until the bank re-opens Tuesday (Monday is a bank holiday). Can someone please help?  Also, this account is a throwaway. I'm embarrassed and I don't want my friends to see. I will be happy to give you my other user name and PM you from that account for proof. Thanks for reading. 
1	I just started classes this week, and I probably won't have any money for a couple more weeks. I'm running pretty low on food and a pizza could feed me for at least a few days. Situation's no more complicated than that. When I get some money, I'd love to return the favor.  Thanks guys. :)
0	I'm sitting here with no where to go and no one to talk to for the moment. I've had a rotten hangover all day I can't shake and I'm starving. Can someone please help?
0	I have cash in paypal but none in my bank account.  It takes three days for it to hit, and a couple of pies would bridge that lapse.  I need someone to swap me a $40 Domino's gift card for $40 in paypal cash and in return when the rest of my Paypal hits my account I'll offer a gift card here to someone who needs it.  It'll cost you nothing to help and gets someone else a gift card. :)  This is my first reddit post, I found RAOP while going through search results looking for pizza places that take Paypal (If only I lived in the UK I could do it directly).  To be clear I am happy to send the cash first if you're a regular here.  I very much understand this is out of the ordinary.
1	I spent all my money on booze for the next week without realizing the fact that I'd need food too... I'm a retard. So! A pizza would be much appreciated. :)
0	So here is my story. I am 21 years of age and have studied music at the University of Arkansas for 2 and a half years. Last sememster I Decided to change majors and it cost me so much in scholarships that I cannot afford school Anylonger. I figured I would work for a semester, maybe a year, then go back to school and keep moving forward. Well I work at a video game store and I love it. The one problem is that I am having to PAyfor things that I usually didn't have to before. So while struggling I decided to consider the military. I did a lot of research and am now deciding between the Marines and the Army. I want to join the Marines but I am keeping my options open until I get as much info as I can. I am going to be moving back in with my parents next month in order to try to save some money but until then I have been living off of granola bars and the occasional ramen. I've had to sell my video games and musical instruments to pay rent and such and have to pay for gas in change most if the time. Anyways thank you for your time.   TL;DR: struggling hungry dude moving in with parents in order to survive till joining the military.  P.S. this whole thing was typed on an iPhone so sorry for any errors.
1	My title pretty much sums it up. I would like to send him a pizza sponsored by Reddit. I would love to be ninja like in my attempt to surprise him and his best friend, both of them jamming with their guitars at his home. If you could make this extra nerdy and geeky someway, that would be a HUGE plus! We are a very new couple and just discovered 1 1/2 weeks ago that both of us are Redditors. Despite this blizzard I am stuck at work, and I would rather be with him right now. Anyhow, anybody willing to help out?  EDIT: PastafarianTwit made my night!!!! Pizza is on the way to my boyfriend as we speak. This is so exciting. *doing a happy dance in my office
1	Last night we cooked carrots and onions with some spices.  It was... ok. There are six of us living together. I am self employed, N is doing a masters degree in Electronic Engineering, J works building renewable energy devices and teaches kids how to do it, K works at a refugee forum, the other K works in a restaurant and J works with children with learning difficulties.  None of us make much money and I don't think anyone has paid their rent today either. If anyone is kind enough to get us a couple of vegetarian (spicy) pizzas in Nottingham, England, that would be most appreciated. Thank you in advance. x
0	i am a single mother of 2 who recently lost my job. we are on such a tight budget &amp; unable to afford to eat anything other than hot dogs ramen n mac n cheese. waiting on assitance &amp; employers seems to take forever when u r so desperate &amp; have to provide for 2. my sons would love some pizza since this is unaffordable for us. thank you so much for your kindness. happy 4th! 
0	Hi all,  My fiance dreads his birthday. I was really excited to make it the best birthday I could. Unfortunately, the cards did not fall that way. Recently we've been going paycheck to paycheck with the little we have over going to food, and lawyers fees (custody battle). I was saving a little aside for his birthday, but unfortunately since I work on commission, it didn't come through the past two weeks. I only had money to pay bills and rent.  I was hoping anyone that had a spare moment and some cash could help me buy a pizza for him this afternoon. We can even consider it a loan. I will pay you back.   Thanks for listening.
0	I don't know what's going on, but I came home today and there's no check in my bank account. I was suppose to get paid on Friday, but of course it was a holiday. I expected it to go in today, but it didn't. And payroll is closed today, so I won't know till Monday. Netflix took the last $16 out of my bank account yesterday, so I'm negative 10 cents now. I'm pretty sure my money will go in Monday, but until then I'm out of food. Is there anyway somebody can send a pizza, some wings, or anything just to tide me over until Monday? I don't have any kids or anything like that it's just me, but I only go grocery shopping every 2 weeks. So not being able to go yesterday left me with very little to work with. I would greatly appreciate any help anyone could provide. Thank you for reading.  Rodger 
0	For the past couple of weeks the college campus here has taken away a majority of money. This last week has been the worst as I contracted the usual bout of seasonal illness. Recently I had to fill in applications to stay in their dorms for this summer, and also this fall. This has come with the unfortunate circumstances of rules, vague descriptions, loopholes, and lots of spending. Turns out that if I only sent in one application for /both/ summer/fall at the time the summer applications were due, I would only have had to pay 40 dollars instead of 80. Loopholes! D:  I do believe someone else definitely needs a pizza more than I do, and while I am finally getting better, I would like a pick-me-up from this frantic week. There's about 2 dollars in my account right now, and this is not enough for a pizza.
0	Hey. Ive read the whole side bar and [this website](http://www.randomactsofpizza.com/index.html). As a Redditor for well over 3 years, Ive known about this community for a long time but this is the first time Ive ever posted here. Before I continue, I just want everyone to know that this isnt my usual reddit account, its a throwaway, as my friends know my other account and I wouldnt want them to see this post. But I would have no problem verifying my usual reddit account with any potential pizza givers. I also have a verification number from the RAOP website.  Anyway, I just woke up. Its 4 am in Ontario, and I dont think many pizza places are open until around 11 am. Me and my two siblings dont really have much here to eat. Im 22 by the way. My siblings are 18 and 17.  And I have about 14 dollars cash, I was just going to buy a some pasta, hamburger, some cans of soup, and a couple boxes of kraft dinner for the weekend. But it'd be nice to have a pizza to eat around lunch today.  Im not sure if I should be posting this now, or later when its a more appropriate time.  Anyway thanks again.
0	Hey! I'm new to this site and this RAOP thing, but it is an awesome idea and it would be soooo awesome if someone out there would get me a pizza!  I would share the pizza with any of my friends who come over, so you would be feeding atleast 3 or 4 broke college students!  My account is new, so if anyone needs any verification or what not I would be more than happy to provide it!  Thank you soo much to anyone that helps, my buddies and I would appreciate it a ton!  BTW I live in Dallas and its wayyyyy to scorching hot to venture outside and walk to somewhere with a dollar menu!
0	Hi, /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza! I just moved in to my first ever apartment a week or two ago, and now that everything's mostly settled I'm out of all foods but bacon and tortillas for the next week. Bacon tacos are tasty and everything, but a pizza would be an awesome alternative. :D
0	Trying to get a job. I've been submitting resumes and going to job fairs. I'm so close to getting one however I am broke and have nothing to eat. My dog ran out of food so she's going on a little "fast" too. It would be a blessing if someone lent a helping hand of pizza. Also I am an artist and would love to sketch up something if you help out.( or whatever you want me to sketch)  
0	Ordered 2 NFL football jerseys and like any hardcore fan, I was jubilant at the thought of finally wearing my team jerseys with pride! That is...until they were stolen off my porch after being delivered. I'm really bummed because they were quite a bit of money (for me at least). A pizza would help alleviate the problem a little. 
0	So, my curcumstance is that I am hungry. I live with my girlfriend and a friend and we have pretty much no food in the house. We have bread, but we ran out of raman yesterday and it is raining. Yesterday all I ate was a bowl of raman and two pieces of bread, and today I have been looking at the clock and thinking about pizza. I am not starving to death, but I would like a warm pizza to fill our stomachs. Also, I lost my wallet with my cards and a bit of cash over a week ago, I am not a deadbeat, but just having a hardish time. Can a man get a pizza for my girlfriend and brother? (refereed to as friend earlier as we are not blood related or related by marriage) I live in California, in Los Angeles County. I will give anymore info as requested.  I come from another forum and I asked if they could help by giving a coupon for a free pizza or something and they suggested I come here. Thank you for taking the time to read my post.
0	Hungry...no money...i'll pay it forward.
0	My dead end job is killing me, I hate it, and I work way too hard at it. I got home tonight and wanted to quit, I get shit from customers on the nightly (I work in a restaurant) and I only make meh money. Don't really have a whole lot else going for me at this point. Could use some pizza... but if not, that's cool too, you guys have a great thing going here. 
0	Just moved into a new apartment, no food, little money and have been craving the deliciousness of a pizza for ages.
0	I just got home from a weekend at my parent's house to find that the my refrigerator stopped working. Everything is spoiled with the exception of unopened cans of pop. I spent all my money while I was out of town and am looking for somethin to eat. Thanks for reading 
1	All I have at home is a loaf of bread, since I was on vacation when the accident happened (as typical in Michigan, a deer decided to do a few cartwheels over the two-week old car).  Luckily insurance is covering the car, but since I don't have a credit/debit card, I had to pay the deposit in cash, depleting all my money until Friday when I get paid again. To make matters worse, the rental car they gave me is a baby blue Nissan Versa, which is embarrassing as hell to drive.  I am in Grand Haven, MI and was wondering if there was any way I could get just a basic pepperoni pizza.  The only chain places are Jets, Pizza Hut, and Dominoes (and Dominoes last I knew used one of those carbon copy things the driver carried for the CC since they demand the person with the card to be here).  I WILL pay it forward after I get paid on Friday.  I am just slightly sick of having toast and butter the past two days...
0	Hi. I recently got dumped and am feeling really low, as is my wallet. Would love to have some comfort food to fill a bit of the hole I'm feeling. 
0	Hi my name is unimportant, i am 19 and from the internet. i am also high and find myself in need for a pizza but have no funds to go twards this pizza i think i might have 42 cents in my bank account i live in your freezer and watch you while you sleep. i could really use a random act of pizza. thank you redit. 
0	It's Tuesday and the week isn't looking up. Trying to get a job but it's not working out, still have to eat. I'd love it if I could get a pie today. 
0	I'm completely in love with this subreddit, I think it is absolutely amazing that people are this nice to strangers! Had no idea reddit had such amazing people here! Any who, I'm a new mom, daddy works an hour away and long shifts. There is food in my house, I just can't find the time to make myself a decent meal while taking care of the baby. I do eat a ton of cereal lately haha, it's the easiest thing here.  Would love a pizza but I know there are a lot more people here that need it more than me. Regardless I still think what you guys do is great and would love to participate in the giving soon! 
0	Some help please? I do have more ramen and pasta. Just want a delectable pie instead with a twist on the process.  I have been here before and have made requests. My one caveat is that I can pay the willing giver back with a pizza when I get paid. In this case it will be this Friday.  However this time I want to do something different. I want to either pay it forward to a person of the givers choice with an included explanation as to why the person deserves a pie, or by giving me an explanation as to why you have decided to give to me a pie.  I want to do it this way to provide some entertainment for the sub, and so this doesn't look like just another desperate request. I look forward to your stories and reasoning.
1	Asking in advance, I'm moving out next wednesday and it would be awesome if the first meal me and my other half get to eat together in the unit was a delicious pizza. We won't be able to afford much good food for a while because we've had to buy a lot of furniture and stuff and we're gonna be a bit short on cash. If anyone was willing to do this that would be amazing.
1	My fiancee had surgery last week, so I took some time off of work to stay home with her for a few days.  I was going to go grocery shopping when I got off work tonight, but when I went out to my car this morning, I had a flat tire with some sort of nail/spike sticking out of the side.  I had to buy a new tire so I can get back and forth to work.  Friday, I got paid $112, giving me a total of just under $120 in my account.  The tire and labor came out to a little over $118, leaving me 82 cents in my account to last until Friday (payday).  So I wasn't able to buy groceries tonight.    In the fridge, we have half a pack of american cheese, a head of lettuce, and soy milk.  In the cabinet, we have a pack of ramen, three slices of bread, and some chocolate syrup.  We live week to week, and we have a grocery budget, and we plan out a weekly menu, buying just what we need for that week's meals.  I'm not going to pretend I've been on Reddit forever.  I created this account 8 months ago, but I never post.  I just come in once in a while to look at the funny stuff.  Tonight, I read an ABC news article about ROAP, and figured it was worth a shot.  If anyone is willing to help me out, we can survive on pizza for two days easily.    It's just my fiancee and myself.    I'm posting links to a screenshot of my bank balance, a photo of the tire receipt, and my latest paystub.  Thank you ahead of time for any help, and if no one can help, I still appreciate your taking the time to read all of this.  I know it's a lot, but the guidelines said to include details.  We have a Dominoe's down the street from us.  So, yeah.  Thanks again, either way.  http://i51.tinypic.com/126fc6a.jpg http://i51.tinypic.com/30cwzgl.jpg http://i52.tinypic.com/2hnz9yu.jpg http://i56.tinypic.com/1gtc7t.png  
0	Hey there, I am going hungry and would really appreciate a pizza from anyone willing. I'll give a little story about what has led me to be extremely poor (Â£9 to last until the end of August).  I went to university this year, and moved out of my parent's home to forge a new life in Peckham, which is when everything started going horribly wrong. I hated my course, the people on my course seemingly went out of their way to make me feel uncomfortable (I'm quite shy, and very insecure).  For years now, I've been fighting my demons, keeping them just below the surface - I've always felt like I was just about floating, reading to sink at any moment. Around Christmas, I did just that - sank like a stone. I fell into a major depressive episode that last months, culminating in what I can only describe as a mental breakdown over Easter. I became dependent on weed, never leaving my room or spending time sober other than to go to work on Sundays, and then I'd come home and get high again. Obviously, I dropped out of university.  This, obviously, was a massive waste of money. It also didn't help that I'd lent one of my now ex-housemates Â£100 to help him pay his rent, which I know now that I will never see again (we live and learn). I have a Â£970 overdraft that is all gone, and although I've at least paid my rent for this month, I won't be getting paid until the end of August. I also have to pay a week worth of council tax (only Â£30 but too much for me) for the week before I enrolled, or I'll have a court date, and Â£40 of library fees tomorrow, but luckily my mum is bailing me out for that (she already bailed me out of last month's rent, so I already owe her Â£500).  I've had to start working full time, eat butter sandwiches at work because it is all I can afford, and improvise for dinner (or just not eat). I'm extremely skinny anyway, and cannot afford this weight loss.  I spend four hours commuting a day (I work in West London), come home, eat, sleep, get up at 6am to go to work again...I feel very lonely at the moment, and a cheesy, greasy pizza with meat or something would go a long way to providing me with a little comfort at the moment.  Sorry for spilling this all out, I only meant to give a short sum out, but have ended up providing you with an essay! I'm not known for being concise...  But yes, a pizza would be so very appreciated, and if the offerer wanted, I can return the pizza favour once I get paid. I would just like some meat and cheese in my life right now haha. Thanks for listening &lt;3
0	So first of all, this account IS a throwaway. Truth be told, I'm embarrassed I'm at this point again, and also, my good friends have my actual account info and I'd just rather them not know I'm here. I have received pizza here once before. My first Reddit cakeday was in August. I'm more than willing to link someone to my real account and provide some sort of proof that I am who I say I am. I just don't want everyone to know! Though I am willing to give thanks from my real account. It's a different feeling, afterwards.  Okay if you made it past that, the short story is that I'm, like most, out of money. I get paid on Friday but until then I'm scavenging. I'm a kind hearted person but I know there are tons of people deserving of food! I'm just hoping someone takes pity on me. Pretty please! I'd be so grateful.  TL:DR - Pizza?  Edit: I live in Washington State.
0	We would all really appreciate it, and would even send a picture of the three of us enjoying the said pizza (if that's your thing).  Just curious to see if this works!!!
1	I just started one of those awesome jobs where you only get paid once a month. It's been a bitch not being able to claim unemployment the last few weeks and currently have [less than adequate funds.](http://i.imgur.com/ls8TW.jpg) Anyone willing to help a guy out? Pretty much been living on ramen and toaster shakens that last couple days.
1	I have been looking for a job for about 3 months now and FINALLY! got the tap from the local UPS depot for a drivers job! Not the most glamorous job i know but hey for this area the money is decent and the station is close to home so no complaints from me! Paying it forward it specifically implied upon first full paycheck.   Also if i get the job i promise not to be one of those jerk delivery guys that punts your nice box of Newegg goodness to the front door of your place from out by the curb!  :D  Any fine human being out there feel inclined to send out a good luck pizza to a prospective package jockey?  Now that i think of it that didn't sound so good.. 
0	Title says it all. I will for sure return the favor after my next paycheck. Thanks either way ;)
0	Was planning to go grocery shopping today but my check wont clear. Spent my last cash on breakfast. Pizza will be rewarded with karma. 
0	Hello guys I am an arizona student attending college for the first time, I recently ran out of my food stamp support for the month for sharing with my unemployed friends/roommates while they get a job and won't have them again until next friday : (   I was wondering if anyone can make me a huge favor with a simple pizza to eat this evening?  Thank you very much for reading.
0	My girlfriend and I just moved into our first apartment together, and after a hot weekend of moving and moving related expenses, we're broke and hungry.  We would love to spend our first real night in our new apartmen snugglin' with a pie.
0	Been hungry since the day before yesterday. Just got a job washing dishes at a nice restaurant. No money until the fifth. I have to walk about a mile and a half to work, so any food is good food.  Had some pretty severe back injuries from 2009 hold me up all year in 2010, 200 pounds of insulation fell on top of my head. I would sure appreciate it.
0	I thought for a while to post up something about being stood up on Valentine's to guilt someone into pizza, but I didn't want to be an asshole so I'll just be honest, I would really appreciate a pizza right now and I'm pretty damn broke myself
0	 There's a local hotspot that takes orders until 12:30 AM called [Big E's pizza](http://bigepizza.com)! It's currently 11:22 PM so this is the only reason I mention that.. I'm not sure if anywhere else is still open. We're gonna be playing video games for the next 24 hours and thought some pizza pie would be cool.   Woo!
1	broke college student with -8.00 dollars to my name and between work checks(subway) would greatly appreciate a pizza to offset a 8th day of Peanut butter and jelly! 
0	Got paid last week and had to ante up everything for the end of the month billing cycle. Help a redditor enjoy watching some great eSports action? The GSL Finals are tonight / tomorrow morning (05:10 EDT) and I'm going to be up all night. Would love to have chow down on some pizza for the occasion.   Looking to pay it forward as soon as I get paid again, in another 2 weeks. 
0	I lost my debit card this Friday after the bank closed I have had no money all weekend. All I have had to eat this weekend is some bread I had leftover in my pantry :( . Too make matter worse I keep getting 1017d in FFXIV.  Been having a pretty crap weekend, so if anyone wants to make it better that would be awesome. Thanks! Will pay the pizza forward later this week!
0	We finished our first half marathon this morning. In too much pain to get food. Delivery PLEASE!
0	Wondering if anybody could help me out! Would pass on the favor this week!
0	I'm writing this on behalf of my friends, They're currently stuck in PA on a 2 week long tour. They spent most of all the money they had on a smaller repair the day before. I donated what I could yesterday, but a $2,700 repair today has crippled them. I can communicate the terms, I'm positive these fun loving guys will send you T-shirts and silly pics. But we can discuss if you want them to write a song or something.
0	I only have a pizza hut nearby plus some local places that are much more expensive.  What I'm programming? An Escape game in Java, think myst but without having to keep a notebook of all the riddles.  EDIT: 50 tries on that pizza hut game and nothing. :(
0	So yeah I flew in on the 17th and am out of the processed food I bought from Sainsburys. Money has not come in and I have popcorn left for dinner. Student life is hard and sad :(
0	Hiya Reddit. My girlfriend is currently suffering from her period, and like the title says is craving pizza. Unfortunatley, we're a little too broke to order pizza, and we would greatly appreciate it if you could offer us pizza tonight.  Thanks for listening guys
0	I'm hungry, spent what money I had and don't want to continue living off of ramen noodles, a pizza would be a blessing.   Of course for my IRL karma I'll be pizza'ing it forward soon!
0	I don't get paid until friday and were out of food. I was wondering if someone wouldn't mind helping us out with a pizza? Thanks for reading and I hope you have a good night!
0	I am a moneyless musician in the Southeastern Michigan area. I'm in college and I just had to pay a LOT of bills. I now have but a few cents to my name!   I will write and record you a song for some RAOP loving. If multiple people offer, I will do my best to write and record songs for each of them (hell, leftovers can feed me for days).  Bring on the requests!
0	So I just found out that I won't be paid at all this month because of some bookkeeper issues. I work in a small neighborhood cooperative and don't make that much to begin with, but this kinda puts me in a dangerous spot with summer electric bills and increasing rent. I know they can't turn off electricity in the summer, so I might go without paying for a few months. A friend turned me on to this subreddit, so I thought I would see if anyone could help out a redditor in New Orleans. I promise to pay it forward as soon as I can :)
1	Hey all,  My life is in the gutter right now.  I've been trying to find a job while trying to take night classes, but neither are working out very well at this point.  I've got a little bit of my reserves left, but that has to last me for the unforeseeable future, and I don't know when or where my next job will come from.  I know it may sound a little sad, but I've forgotten what pizza tastes like, it's been so long since I've had any.  And being transplanted from Chicago, this is not a good feeling.  Anyone have it within themselves to help me out?
0	My husband and I are down on our luck and have recently maxed out our CC's buying food, he's unemployed and myself a mother to be, times are rough, but we know they will get better. He's to humble to ever ask so i've snuck off to ask this in the other room  Thanks for any help RAOP  -A hungry family to be  
1	Here is everything that I have been going through for the past month  i went back to the hospital because of suicadal and depression...(Ive already been once, and this time got diagnosed with bipolar)  gave me a shit tons of medicatinos, (I find out later that were all outdated,  and all had adverse side effects with each other) missed 3 imporant auditions (I am an actor, missed 1 theater audition and two major film auditions, batman and Avengers)'  As soon as I get released from the hospital, I get a nagging throbbing pain in my side, turns out to be a kidney stone, start pissing blood that wont stop for three week  then drove up to CPH (Cleveland Playhouse) for a callback for their first downtown show (Really big deal in Cleveland) while dealing with a kidney stone on my way there from Parents house, which is  a two hour drive my car broke down so every 20 miles i had to get out, fill it up with water in the heatwave so i just got more dehydrated which is awful for kidney stones, and just made things incredibly difficult and uncomfortable.  get there to the audition all sweaty, delarious, and dehyrdated fucked up that audition drove home, same 20 mile bullshit go home, get the worst pain of my entire life, THE WORST PAIN YOU CAN EVER IMAGINE. Google Kidney stone pain.  While I was in the hospital, I lost my job, (which later turns into cutting hours) because they don't think I am "reliable and stable", so due to this, I can't pay rent on a new place, and my lease is up August 1st, so I have to move back home.  Work decides to give me hours, but only 20hrs a week, and from my parents house, its over an hour and 15 min away.  then my 2cd week back at work, i got attacked again by kidney stones got yelled at again from my boss because I "should have seen the stone coming and not went to work: Go to the ER, and urologist and they tell me  i have to wait 19 days to get a CT scanto see whats wrong with my kidneys Get  an email form my old landlord basically saying im not getting my deposit back.  And last night, TO TOP EVERYTHING OFF, someone broke into my truck.   I've passed 3 kidney stones, My kidneys are sore, Im pissing blood, I am broke, Im depressed, and lonely, and would love a pizza for the steeler game tonight. I live around Akron Ohio.  Thanks, sorry for the really long read.
0	I'm sooooo hungry  im black
0	I'm just craving a pizza. Just figured I'd put up a request. Hanging out playing some Dark Souls tonight after watching it on a stream recently. If you've played it you know my pain.
0	First off, long time lurker, just found out about this subreddit and thought maybe someone may be able to help. Over the weekend, I let a good friend of mine borrow my 1998 Ranger. He ended up drinking and driving and drove through a fence (and then on my rims around the block). Totaled it. It was the last thing my dad gave me and I can't afford repairs nor the tow for weeks. By the time I can get it out, it will be costing more than it's worth. I am still going to get it out and fix it, because it is sentimental. All I have to eat is rice for the next three weeks (maybe more); so, I'm not starving, but a pizza would really be a pick-me-up at this point. 
1	There's 5 of us and all we can afford is Ramen. :(
0	We're not actually starving, but we don't have any food or money. My measly paycheck ran out already and with bills and upcoming birthday, we didn't have a lot of money for groceries. Haven't had pizza in a while!
0	I've been living off bologna sandwiches and ramen for the past few months, and all I can think about is getting a hot slice of pizza. No sad stories, just a big craving. Thanks!
0	I'm in the Pacific Northwest. Yesterday we had a beautiful, cloudless day, and while there's clouds out today - it's bright and shiny and pretty outside.  Could use a pizza to go with the gorgeousity while I'm stuck inside plugging away at a Java Programming I course. And yes I know, that's not a word. Unfortunately I live out in The Sticks (tm) and nobody delivers to me, but I'm willing to drive out and pick up a pizza.  (Dominos has that 7.99 lg pizza carryout deal, which helps)
0	I'm an american archaeology student working abroad in the UK. I don't get paid for a couple more days and I'd like to avoid eating boiled potatoes on their own. Sweet pizza has not passed my lips in over half a year. Can you imagine?  I'm willing to do what I can in return (proofread an anthro related paper? photograph me cutting and consuming pizza with my trowel, while wearing dig clothes perhaps? Salacious pictures of my moobs?) If you've got other ideas shoot them at me. 
0	Stretched out what little I had after bills and rent but I didn't leave myself with much. I get paid at Midnight and my stomach is feeling pretty empty. I will pay it forward tomorrow. Thus it has been written and so shall it be. 
0	IRL cakeday today. Some reddit pizza sounds like a great gift to this aspiring biochemist. PiF is a given, of course.
0	I will in return draw an animal of your choice. Thanks. 
1	I am really trying to finish my first project till the end of this week, I am now really stressed out as I fell behind with my previous plan and am currently running out of ideas about what to write, have to work everyday at 6pm which significantly cuts my time to fully dedicate the entire day to my university projects, staying at work till 1am.   I am financially dried out and get paid on the 25th which is next week. I would appreciate pepperoni pizza if anyone would be willing to help. There is Domino's pizza here in Canterbury, UK.   Cliche maybe, I know... but I am telling the truth... (the good old: who would lie on the internet, right? :) )  Thanks!!!  
0	Hey, reddit! I just discovered this subreddit, and think it is amazing.   I'm hanging out with friends from college that I don't see much and think this sub is amazing. I live near a dominos and a pizza hut, they're both relatively cheap. There's also a little Caesars which is very cheap I think like 5 dollars for a pizza.   I wouldn't ask for a RAOP if we weren't all completely broke.  I have 40 dollars until 2 fridays from now, but a pizza for me and my friends would be amazing. Plus, an awesome story to share and might make my friends give reddit a shot! :)    **If not, thanks for reading and have a great day fellow redditors! :)**  EDIT: Also, would definitely be willing to pay it forward once I find a second job :) 
1	Some bills took me by suprise and now I am poorer than ever, so I was hoping you could help me with a pizza.  I bought the humblebundle ( A lot of games ) recently so I can give you a game for your pizza ( Dead Space, Medal of Honor, Crysis 2, Burnout Paradise )  Edit: oohh... cakeday :)  Thank you for reading.
1	My friends and I are poor medical students living out of dorms next to the hospital in Portland, Maine.  There's 3 of us here now, the other 3 are working their morning shift - 6:30AM to 5PM.  I think it would be awesome to surprise them with pizza when they come back. What do you think reddit?  Can we get them some pizza?
1	I don't get paid until next Friday, and the last packet of ramen was used for dinner a few nights ago. I've got pickle juice and mayonnaise in the refrigerator and I'm not sure even sure if the mayo is any good... A hot meal would be majorly appreciated.  Edit: I forgot to mention that when I get paid, I'll return the favour. It'll just be a week.
0	hey r.a.o.p, were two seventeen year olds looking for something to eat. only problem is between the two of us we have a whole seven dollars. if you all would be so kind as to PM me il get you back a pizza when i come across some money. thanks and have a good day!
0	My girlfriend and I are college students, we manage to pay our few bills by donating plasma at a local Biolife, unfortunately after our internet and cellular bills we are left with a very small amount of money to live off of and most of that money gets put toward gas to get us back and forth to our school, as well as toward dog food.   At this point my bank account is overdrawn, I have my computer on craigslist to get a few extra bucks from (im an IT major), and we are struggling to get by.    I know this is a long shot but all I ask for is a pizza so that we can eat something other than noodles for the first time in almost a week. IF any one would be willing to help out I would be so grateful.  The only problem is that it would have to be an in-store pickup, not delivery, because we live outside of the range of any of the major delivery shops.         
0	My mother abandoned my family (father, sister, brother, and I) back in November and ever since we haven't even had enough money to buy food. We have taken out multiple loans to pay our rent and food banks won't give us Any more food. We spent the day today cleaning out our house and getting rid of more of my mothers stuff. It's been emotionally and physically draining and a pizza for the family would be great.  Thanks for reading
0	I just brought pizza to a friend who has gone through a lot lately and is in the psych ward. Made me really wish I had enough money to get all the guys in there pizza. If the hospital near any of you is like mine, it'll have a pretty small inpatient psych ward that a couple pizzas would probably cover. Believe me folks, psych ward patients could all use a slice of 'za
0	No money to buy food right now but if someone would be kind enough to feed me I would be incredibly grateful and promise to pay it forward as soon as I am able to!  Thank you reddit!
1	Let me start by saying that this site is incredible.  First of all, it's encouraging to see so many wonderful people out there helping each other.  That's just magical.  The other side of that is while I'm not glad to know there are others going through what I'm going through, I am glad to know that I'm not alone.  I think that's probably the hardest part sometimes.  You look around and you see everyone else, and no one lets on that anything is wrong.  Some people make life look so easy.  I haven't know easy in a long time.  There's a Sheryl Crow song that goes, "No one said it would be easy, but no one said it'd be this hard."  I hear that in my head a lot.  I'm not looking for easy, I just wish every minute wasn't such a struggle.    I will say this though.  Today has been an amazing day.  I came on here looking for help, and have found myself being able to help others.  I can't tell you how great that has made me feel today.  This is a feeling that everyone should know.    My husband died a little over a year ago.  I have been working three jobs to try and support our two kids who are 3 and 4.  In January I went back to school to pursue a degree in nursing so that I could have a steady future.  I can not tell you how intimidating it is being back in school all these years later and being a mom on top of that.  It's going well though, and I'm excited for the future.    We are barely making it each month, but we find a way.  My daughter is going to turn 4 in two weeks, and I'm having a small party for her at our home.  It has a modest budget, and I've been coming up with what will hopefully be fun cheap activities for the party.  What I'm hoping is to make it a pizza party.  It's just something that the way the bills fall and the money comes in that I'm not in a position to really splurge on.   I'm praying for some help and appreciate anyone who stopped to even read this.  Thank you. 
0	hey Ive been working for my neighbour but its only enough to pay rent, havent had real food in my house in a long time... I usually goto my sisters to eat but that horse has ridden away, would really love it if someone could help me out, if not its all good maybe someone else deserves it more! 
0	Been looking for a job for 6 months and to this day I still have no luck. Would appreciate it if someone can help a brother out.
0	hi! my partner and I have a been traveling and living on the streets for the past couple of years. We recently decided to settle down and change our pace a little bit. We've been here for a month and already have a place to stay and I start working a job I think I'm going to absolutely enjoy tomorrow. So everything is going great and I wish the world a kitten filled glory hole tastic day! We're just bummed we have to celebrate my last day of unemployment eating peanut butter toast and I promise to return the favor as soon as I get paid. Thanks! 
0	Don't want to spend much on takeout so I'm starving myself. Would really love the help  ---  a broke college student
0	I would really appreciate a free pizza, I don't know if it works this specifically, but Pizza hut is the closest to my house. If not that, then Papa Johns. Please and thank you ahead of time, Keesha
0	Hi everyone,  Me and my group members have a big project due in tomorrow at 4 p.m. which of course means we're going to be up all through the night finishing it, and would love some pizza to help keep us going. [we're in the UK if this makes a difference - never been on here before!]  thanks for reading,  3 hungry workers.
0	Sick in bed with what I think might be acute bronchitis (can't get in to see the doctor until tomorrow, so I don't really know). Whatever I have isn't the kind of thing that affects your appetite, because I am absolutely starving, and I really don't feel up to cooking actual food in the actual kitchen. I would just about die of happiness if I had a nice hot, comforting pizza and something cold and fizzy to drink right now, and if anybody is willing to hook me up, I will happily pay it forward as soon as I can! :)  ETA: I'm in Texas, USA, btw.
1	Broke ass-college student here; got paid 10 days ago and all of my paycheck went to rent and bills. I've got no groceries in the house and all my roommates are back home for the summer. No gas in the car and the bike's out of commission :(. If any kind redditor could hook me up I'd be able to eat for two days :D  google maps link to domino's in my area http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=10239146004443176581&amp;q=domino's+pizza,+chico,+ca&amp;hl=en&amp;sll=39.722827,-121.848776&amp;sspn=0.012468,0.024856&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=39.733066,-121.864429&amp;spn=0,0&amp;z=15   EDIT: oh, and of course: I'll be pizzaing it forward when my paycheck comes next month. this is a ridiculously cool subreddit.
1	Hi Reddit. Im a single dad having a really rough time. My friend mentioned this site to me so i could try to get some help. I was out of work for awhile but i recently found a new job! i dont get paid until a week from now and i can go to afood pantry monday. Could someone please help us out tonight? I will pass the favor on once i get caught up. I promise. im in virginia. Thanks for reading.
0	Hey ROAP, I was wondering if anyone would be interested in giving some pizza and maybe wings to a Fire Department. Their are currently 8 people on duty, so it may be a 'larger' order. They have all saved countless lives.
0	My husband and I are trying to live on $674 a month disability and $81 a month food stamps.  Needless to say, we don't eat out and a pizza would be nice. thanks
1	I've ended up sticking myself in a bit of a rut, guys. I've been living on my own for about 6 months now, and about 3 months ago, finally found a job. It's great and all, but the hours are less than desirable. Corporate won't let us go over 32 hours a week. I get paid every two weeks. This last pay period has hit me pretty hard in the wallet department. I finally had the money saved up to put down on a vehicle. A motorcycle, actually. Considering how cheap they are overall, I think it was a pretty good choice. Unfortunately, paying my bills, $100 out of the paycheck for the motorcycle payment, and another $100 or so to get it road legal...Has left me without food until Friday. The change that I've collected over the past couple months adds up to $6.17, which I need to use to fill my gas tank so I can get to work.  I'll be straight up here, a large pizza could feed me for 2 days, 3 if I stretch it. I would certainly be willing to pay it forward to another unfortunate soul in the coming weeks, if someone were to help me out now.
0	Paul is 70, Stones are (rumored) to stop touring in 2013.  I'll post pics with pizza and b-day candles &amp; will give KB the crust.... I'll even go out to Buddy Holly's grave and take a pic with the box!  KB LOVES the crust.  Help a OLD hippeh chick celebrate.  KB is the rottweiler and she NEVER gets crust anymore....  No check until friday and the s.o.b. that promised me he would call about the job, DID'NT.  New here, REDDIT-ly challenged.  WILL pay it forward! 
0	I was wondering if Reddit would gift me a pizza to enjoy with a couple of family members. I am so bogged down with bills it is crazy. I would pay it forward when I can. Thank you in advance.
1	Recently, I had to file an extension for my U.I. but my payments ended up getting delayed from it and was force to overdraft a cheque to pay for rent. Thankfully, I'm getting the payments by next week and some incoming gigs(barbacking) by Wednesday. Until then, I only have a few dollars and a supply of ramen. If anyone is willing to make my day by sending me pizza. I would be more then grateful for the random act of kindness.  I have a RAOP verification code if needed. 
0	I'm a college student and I would love to get a random act of pizza. I forgot that the dinner hall closes early on Saturday, so I missed dinner. I only have $3 with me and my roommate is out doing a project, so I can't get her to help me. I have no food in my fridge and the only food I have with me is chocolate and popcorn. 
0	Been going through a difficult time financially and don't get my paycheck until Friday. I would be glad to back it back or forward this weekend. I know this is a long shot but me and the kids could use a mood lift. A dinner of dry cereal makes no one a happy camper in this house LOL. Anyway thank you for taking the time to read. Hopefully this works.
0	I honestly can't remember the last time I had pizza. It's a sad life, but when you're unemployed, luxuries such as pizza go away. Anyway, I've just been craving pizza like mad for a week or so, and I don't want to eat mac and cheese AGAIN for the third time this week. I'm going to be up super late studying for these 3 chapters and doing quizzes. Lurked for a while, but never submitted anything to this sub...hoping a generous soul will help out this hungry soul!
0	I just got a job yesterday but I wont have money for the next 2 weeks for food. Thank you so much in advance for anyone who helps.  Also since I should clarify, the family of five is her and her mom, step dad, step sister, and me. I live here out of necessity since living conditions at my grandmother's house became unlivable for me. 
0	Haven't had pizza in a while
0	I quit my job to go abroad for 30 days.  Not the best decision of my life, but I would never get the opportunity to take a trip like I did again.  While I was gone, due to circumstances outside my control, I lost my apartment.  So, I come back after 30 days to no job and no place to live.  My roommate was kind enough to start packing for me after he had packed his own things.  Now I'm here, living with my parents who can't afford to take me in.  I've just got a job (I made seven dollars yesterday! Yay!) but, can't really afford to spend anything on anything extra.  I'd really just like a pizza.  I live in Alaska.  If anyone is willing to hook me up let me know.
0	hey ROAP, i'm pretty much out of money for the next two weeks and it would be amazing if someone bought me a pizza. I could care less where it's from as long as it makes me not hungry. Doesn't even have to be pizza for that matter, just any food really.
0	He's 20 today, and we have a full night of gaming to power through. We also can't drive, and I only have $2 to my name. He's got a bunch of PS3 games, and if you'd like we can play BF3 or some other games online together :3
0	I have a girl over and there's no food to feed her with, but there's a Pizza Nova downstairs. If you could order a pizza and leave it under whatever name you choose, I'll go grab it.   Thank you guys!  Here's the store information:  (416) 439-0000  5585 Yonge Street, Toronto, ON M2N 5S4  
0	Not much left in the cupbard today to say the least, but if someone would be nice enough to help me get some pizza today I would pay it forward the moment I'm able :)  Edit: Still hungry... [STILL REQUEST]... &gt;.&gt;.... Will love someone long time for some pizza. &lt;.&lt;.... "Love long time"=pay it back/forward/the appropriate way. It's been a long day with nothing but hot fries to snack on and my stomach is growling.. :(  Thanks Guys!  
0	A friend of mine is feeling depressed. Unfortunately, I'm a few states away, so I can't offer hugs. I thought of the next best thing: Get them a pizza!  I know, I know...Get it yourself. Thing is, both of us are on government benefits. Guess what they don't cover? (If you answered "Cooked pizza", you'd be right! They actually don't cover hot foods period.) So, since my electronic money supply is short (paypal is at $0.00, specifically) and I don't have a credit card, I decided I'd check here. Help?
0	Im asking for a pizza, not because you should feel sorry for me, but because fun to interact with strangers. Have you ever thought its strange that people think it is ok to ask for money from total strangers but they think it is too much to ask to get into a personal conversation with people who help them? I think most the people here are have good intentions for giving away pizza and dont need to be treated like a stalker or rapist or whatever. Im not going to open up my whole life to you, but I promise more than trivial conversation and interaction.  And I really need this pizza, Im saving for college, Ive been eating really cheap food lately.  I live in Gig Harbor, Washington  The reason I dont have many posts on reddit is that I am not able to access my old account under the name "arquebus", it says that no email exists for that name, so I dont know how to get it back. I used to post a lot at www.reddit.com/r/programming/ under that name
1	My boyfriend and I are on pretty tight times at the moment, and have basically been living off hot dogs and Ramen for a bit now. I personally would like to make the food I have last as long as possible, and I'd love to surprise him with something good, since he just found out his hours have been cut. Anything would be appreciated, but if you're feeling super nice, his favorite is Papa Johns!
0	So I'm in college now and am on a very limited budget...unfortunately, it's all been expended on books and food from earlier this semester (mostly books, they're about $100 a pop now).   I'm really living off of a stockpile pasta and this point...which gets VERY old fast. So, I would like to request a random act of pizza tonight! I can't tell you how happy it would make me!!   I'm in Washington, DC, by the way.  Also, I can submit you a picture of my bank account...which has a mere 87 cents in it now. I'm not sure how to post it on this page!!  
0	I am new to Reddit, after reading several threads I doubt I'd have a chance, this isn't a sob story nor am I begging, but today is my daughters 9th birthday, I've been working my butt off just to keep our home, I got my daughter a birthday card and that's all I could afford, although I plan on making it up to her I just want her to be able to have something special today and I can't even provide a decent meal to her today, if someone could help me make my little girls birthday special I'd appreciate it. I feel terrible asking I've always been the independent one, but I really just want to turn this day around.   I can provide whatever is needed to be provided to make this happen.
0	I would be so thankful if someone would send me a pizza any kind! any type! I haven't really had the problem of not having money for food until recently, it sucks.
0	Things are very tight for me, and have been for a long time. But that's going to change soon :) as I'll be moving into a fantastic house in the heart of the city, with two lovely friends. My expenses will be halved, and I'll be closer to everything that's hapening :D   I keep feeling this mix of anticipatory excitement and nauseating terror - it's clear that this is kind of a moment, like I'm closing a chapter on one part of my life and starting the next one. And I wanna celebrate with pizza, not with ramen or easy mac, which is all I'll have til payday on Friday.  So really, I just want a greasy carb bomb to the gut, to properly honor this moment! Thanks :)
0	only made enough money this week to cover rent. just smoked and could use a pizza.
0	In a nutshell, i've been reading requests, offers, and comments and there are alot of nice giving people and alot of mean people; if you are mean and judgemental stop reading and go to another post. I decided to give this a try and see if I will survive... I am the oldest of 6 children, i'm 19, and we are a family of 8. I know, BIG family. Anyways, I wouldn't have it any other way as I have enjoyed having my younger brothers and sisters to pick on but we never got or get to have pizza as a family because when my parents buy one it is never enough for all of us so I would like to have a couple of pizzas to enjoy with my family where we don't have to be reminded that we can only have one slice of pizza because WTF, who gets full with one slice. Also, my parents are not on any assistance which would be great for us but they are struggling financially. If someone can help great, if not, thank you anyways. We do have junk food like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and chocolate chip cookies but no PIZZA. Dominoes will work if anyone is interested in helping me surprise my family. Thanks
0	Any place will do (Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, I don't think there is a Domino's up here).  Please and thank you very much.   Edit:  We (boyfriend, myself, and disabled grandma) are in Mentor-on-the-lake, Ohio.
0	No real sob story here or anything, just craving on my birthday. Cheers
0	We are a family of 5 myself , husband and 3 kids.  Craving pizza and inbetween paydays. Can anyone help us out ? Pizza Hut is local but little ceasers, dominoes is pretty close as well but would have to pick up. 
0	Hey y'all.  So, I live in Fort Worth TX. I'm shuttered in my room tonight doing homework and studying. I won't be asleep till at least 4 at the earliest and I just need some food to scarf down while I go over these kanji and sentence structures. Any help is appreciated! :D
0	[Sob story](http://www.reddit.com/r/Assistance/comments/1gob8a/evicted_from_the_house_out_of_hell/)  Our pantry is almost empty and we're kinda wigging out. A cheesy pepperoni would be fantastic (Bonus points for stuffed crust ;D)
0	Instead of eating food I've been playing Borderlands on OnLive most of the day for the past 2 days. I'm completely out of food, I got a cup of flour but that isn't even enough to bother with. I've been unemployed since March, turned down for every kind of assistance I applied for, and a few weeks back they closed the one food pantry nearby I was getting what little I could from.   Somebody I grouped with earlier killing told me to look this place up, see if I'm lucky enough to score some eats. I've been cutting lawns, doing the flea market thing, but I am tapped and have no idea when I'm gonna get anything else in. People ain't buying like they used to so even Craigslist and Ebay failed me.  Please, I need something to eat. I'm on my second play through for this character I started yesterday and I can't keep ignoring the stomach for long. Orange drops or not, Borderlands is not a substitute for edibles.
1	It would be much appreciated, and payed forward later on. 
0	Hello there, I am a single parent who's been ravaged by this 5 day blackout here in Waukegan.  I've had to empty hundreds of dollars worth of food from my once cold refrigerator.  My kids are constantly asking for take-out however I cannot afford it.  I would be greatly appreciative of anyone who could help a family in need out.  We were ravaged by storms recently which have left us in a 5 day blackout as of yet.  I hope some redditer reads this and has sympathy for our situation.  Willing to provide pics of our empty fridge and our neighborhood in the morning when there is light to see the devastation.   I hope all is well with the community and wish everyone a good night. 
0	So, I found this page on accident, thought I might as well try it out. I was recently fired from my job, so a pizza would be awesome!
0	**EDIT** I am situated here in Atlanta, Georgia. Sorry for not posting the state in the title guys.  If this sub is anything like the rest of Reddit I might get a little sympathy for being a total idiot my entire life. To make a long story short I was born in Salt Lake so I was branded LDS from conception. My 21st birthday party was a trip to temple to hear president Hinckley (our "Prophet" at the time) speak about family. Even then I thought that was a lousy birthday. Up until yesterday I held priesthood in the church and was a key toting, card carrying member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  That is no longer the case, I got up in the middle of sacrament on Sunday, and, after a less than friendly chat with our Bishop yesterday, I am officially done with religion. I've been on the ropes for years but the cowpies just got stacked one too high lately. So I've had enough. If God exists he certainly doesn't look well upon the LDS followings. You know how much garbage I caught for buying a cup of coffee on Sunday? Way too much. For one thing caffeine is a no no but another lesser known of my former beliefs is we're not supposed to do anything business related on the Sabbath day. No dining out, no work, no grocery shopping, etc. And the fact that I bought something turned almost the whole congregation on me. That was some good coffee too.  So basically I've spent 28 years trying hard to believe in something, spent 2 years in Japan trying to make other people believe it with me, and now I'm pretty much alone because of my refusal to believe in the most ridiculous things our church kept pushing on me. I got 2 friends who aren't LDS, the others won't stick with me after renouncing their religion so I'm in the market for new friends to boot lol.  If you have any questions about the spooky and mysterious world of Mormonism ask away. And if you could spare some dinner for a guy who's tax check hasn't arrived yet you'd have my blessing and gratitude. And no, not a religious kind of blessing. More like a walk tall and drink lots of water kinda blessing lol. Hope you're all having a nice day and thanks for reading.
0	Hi     We're moving today and with fronting for the new deposit, paying for tuition at Davis, and double rent...we're tapped out. We have already had issues today- budget screwed up our rental truck and we had to drive 30 miles away to pick up a replacement and our new apt was dirty so now we are waiting on a cleaning service to sort that out! We got two friends to help us (with 2 kids I can't help my husband much) but we need to feed them! Could somebody help us out with a couple of pizzas today?
0	It's my 18th birthday today and no one has seemed to remember it! Even my parents! I know i've kept it quiet but I cant help but feel a little un-loved :( Please may I have one little moment of joy today? Even if it is just pizza :) I would be soo grateful! xxx
0	Hey guys, a pizza would be awesome before i have to start diggin through the pantry/ freezer to make it to payday! thanks
1	Hey guys I'm   college student who lives in a small apartment with my friend and twin brother. We take turns cooking/buying dinner for each other and it's my turn tonight. I've been sick all weekend and would normally just order a pizza, but I instead had to spend my cash on prescriptions and my doctor's visit. If anyone could help out it'd be great. I can prove the doctor's visit and meds via PDF. I live in Tempe Arizona and it would mean the world to me if I could not break this tradition that we have in our apartment.
0	Well reddit, I'm slightly drunk and incredibly hungry. I'm trying to grind out notes on this chapter about connective tissue and it is proving to be especially trying. I thought I would beg someone for some pizza to help me pull through this rough ordeal... wait, is this /firstworldproblems?  But... I would really appreciate a pizza. Hell. I might even share it with my engineering room mate, it is up to you to decide how heartless I am!  Location: Maine
0	Hello nice folks!  I just got back from a two week tour starting from Minnesota.  We hit up like 11 states down south within that time period.  Needless to say, Im flat broke and pretty hungry!  Also, there was a complete lack of pizza during the tour, which is absolutely insane.  Thats what being in a band with vegans gets ya!  Now I crave it, and I have no moneys to spend.  
1	He is pretty miserable, we dont even have a TV or anything up there. Was hoping someone might be able to help me treat him tonight as I cant afford to myself. Dont get me wrong, I have noodles so we wont go hungry just daydreaming of something tastey :)
0	Hey guys, I'm feeling a bit lonely at the moment - a lot of problems came crashing down and I just need a little pick me up. Financials have been bad, my relationship with my parents is going downhill and I'm tired of eating pasta with butter for dinner.  I can't offer much in return, but I have quite a few books I wouldn't mind sending you, mostly classics but a few contemporary works. I also do web design and could set up a little personalized page for you (or anyone of your choice) on my domain.  Thanks guys, and I hope to be able to offer a pizza soon... This sub makes me smile =)
0	hey guys, me and some friends, there is three of us total are all flat broke(all our money goes to rent and basic needs, we just all moved out and in together) but were totally out of food without access to even a grocery store to even try and rack some food, and due to a recent cold snap its been way to cold to panhandle. If anyone could order us a pizza we would be forever in debt.
0	Its a lazy and broke saturday and me and the kiddos have no vehicle,thats about as honest as I can get! Oh and Im tired n all the kids have a cough and my husband got to escape to work..meh
0	I would really love some pizza. Actually, any food would be good right about now.
0	I was able to save myself a bit of hassle by duct taping my transmission. I am still broke, but the Jeep lives! Pizza me today and your favor will returned Wednesday (11Sep). I live in Kentucky on the TN border.
0	Doctor prescribed me Ambien and I decided to take a tumble into a DVD rack in my sleep. Broke and could use some comfort food. Image below.  http://i.imgur.com/iNPTIz0.jpg
0	Hopefully I'll have a job very soon and will be able to buy pizza for a nice redditor, but as of now I've got a little over $20 to my name. I'm very hungry and pizza would sure beat more campbell's. 
0	I just moved to New York City and started my new job. I get paid my very first check on friday but I currently have no money in my bank account, so I'm not sure what to do until then. Figured I would try this out. Cool idea regardless, I can't wait to pay it forward!    Edit: Pizza received. 
0	Pathways Home Base Youth Drop In Centre loves the idea of RAOP and would love to receive a generous gift of some pizza one night for our youth who come to the Centre.  We are helping at-risk and homeless youth regain control of their lives with supportive assistance, life skills, employment assistance and counselling.  Anyone willing to offer a pizza in our area - we would greatly appreciate it.  We are only open Mon - Fri until 8pm.  No sob stories, just want to give someone the opportunity to help us help youth.  I know they would love it.  We never get the chance to offer pizza so this is a great opporunity if someone wants to help out.
0	My roommate and I are hopefully graduating next week on my birthday, currently doing an all-nighter but our grumbling tummys are interfering with our studying. Rent is due tomorrow so that means no funds :( However a pizza with pineapple tomato and canadian bacon from wise guys would most likely help us focus, and thus graduate. making our last four years worthwhile. 
0	Poor college student who would love a pizza! A night off from homework, just relaxing and watching a movie with a pizza would be awesome :)
1	I am requesting a pizza for dinner. My hubby is in the ICU unit,.He had a sezuier and hit his head. They had to do emergency Brain surgery, He is medical coma. Its to early to tell what is going to happen to him. If you cant do a pizza, Please sent good thoughts his way .  Why am I on the internet? I am trying to keep my mind busy, Thanks :]
0	Help me RAOP and I will return the favor on payday!!!
1	My dad passed away a couple of months ago. Since I'm in full-time school, I wasn't able to go back to work, I knew that the stress of dealing with dad being gone and school AND work would be too much. He was my best-friend, and the only one who helped me when I needed it.   My boyfriend has a job, which he was supposed to start 3 weeks ago, but due to the weather he's not starting until this weekend. We are completely strapped for cash, and our cupboards are bare.  If anyone is willing to help us out, we can pay it forward with his first cheque.  I hate asking for help, but I figure, what the hell, it's just some pizza and I'd love to pay it forward.  -Ally 
0	My brother called me to ask if I could drive to his house and buy him some food since he's been too sick to go out for a few days. I'm pretty sure all he eats is sushi from the restaurant he works at, so some pizza would do his body good.  In return I offer an awesome TV show: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EkN8WtFTpE (also I have a few copies of dota2)
1	Hey all! It's about 95 degrees here and our kitchen is pretty much empty save for some bread and cereal.  My girlfriend/fiance is 8 1/2 months pregnant and we could use a good meal.  We promise to pay it forward when we get money! Thanks so much in advance!
0	I live in Minnesota and its -40 today with the windchill and they made us go to school. Me and my friend would really enjoy a pizza. My friends username is sparklebear3000.
0	Only one place delivers to my house, and i don't get paid until thursday. I promise to reciprocate the gracious gifting of pizza on payday, though :)
0	Just got out of the hospital after a really bad downhill biking crash. Didnt have a chance to go grocery shopping before the crash and now not able to sit to drive to grocery store. Would very much like a pizza so don't have to starve tonight. Will return the favour after pay day at the end of month. Located in Kelowna BC canada
0	all alone at a yard sale thats not mine. havent sold anything yet....  and i have to watch everything so it dont get stolen. dinnertime coming up and food is scarce. plz help if you can
1	I'm helping my friend out who got kicked out of his house, letting him crash here and offering my time and whatever else he needs. As a result of helping him drink his way out of this (not healthy, I know, but we all deal in different ways, and he IS looking for a new place) we're broke and I'm out of ideas to cheer him up. Then I saw this place. It would be a perfect story, and cheer him up immensely, if some random stranger on the internet helped us out. 
0	My sister and I live in the Fort area of Knoxville, and our shorter summer hours at work have allowed us to pay our bills (rent, medical, etc.) only.  Food is a little bit more difficult to come by because I have Crohn's/cannot eat gluten, but nearby pizza joints have been offering gluten-free options.  Any help would be so incredibly appreciated. Come next week, we'd love to return to the favor, too. Peace and love to all of you!
1	We're riding on RAGBRAI (ragbrai.com, if you're curious (on mobile! Hard to format!)).   We're sitting around talking about how cool it'd be to have some pizza. 1 pizza. 2 pizzas. 100 pizzas. Any pizza would be cool.   We'll be camping in Perry, IA tomorrow and Des Moines, IA the day after that.   We'll prove it. Internet is limited, but we can call/text easily.   We'll take cool pictures of us eating this hypothetical pizza to help show our gratitude. 
0	I just want a pizza. I'm tired of eggs, ramen, and grits. A pizza for dinner would be rad. That's all. Thank you.
0	Hey Reddit, Me and my friends are all pretty high, we're all also now starving, with nothing but frozen mice (for my snake) and coffee in the house we could really use a pizza. We spent all our money on weed, you know how it is. Please empathise with our situation Reddit. Peace!
0	I'll keep this short, but a failed transmission have put my partner and I behind close to around $1000 with repairs, hotels, and other things. We were heading to Boston, already booked, and couldn't cancel our hotel, losing us another couple hundred. While we should be able to get going again tomorrow, we are between paychecks and would really appreciate the help of anyone who is willing to help.  At this point, we are hungry, not picky at all, and hoping to repay this subreddit back when we're back in Montana.   If you're willing to help, please let me know. I will do whatever I can to repay it to you, or on your behalf.
0	I've been without a job since the middle of August, so I've been living off of what's been left of my savings account. I've been living off of bagels and yogurt for the past month or so, and I really want a pizza to liven things up (and it'll feed me both tonight and tomorrow, too). As a college student who doesn't have a meal plan, this would mean a lot to me.  I'll gladly pizza you (or someone else on this subreddit, if you want) at an equal value at a later date, once I get a job and my first paycheck. I'm hearing back from an interview later this week, so it could be pretty soon that I pizza you back.  Thank you for reading, and I'd love to be able to give to this subreddit once I have money.
0	I am under no hardships. I'm just a 17-year-old kid living near Chicago, and I just think that my sister would be pleasantly surprised by a nice pizza. It's been a while since we've had to share something. ;)  Donors, if you're looking to help someone in need, look elsewhere. Although I'd like a pizza, I really don't *need* one, and there's plenty of requests on here that really do.  That being said, if you're still up for helping me be the coolest brother of the day, I live in Naperville, IL.   Thanks!
1	My gf and I have hit some hard times with her losing her job and then unemployment as well for being physically unable to perform her job due to various hand injuries as a server in a restuarant. She is currently petitioning to have unemployment reinstated due to medical reasons for being unable to perform her job, but until then things are really tight and ANYTHING would help us out right now.   I've been both a giver and receiver in RAOP before and would certainly return the favor again when I am able to reciprocate. It took everything we have to pay rent today and some food would go a long ways towards making our next couple of days go by much better with some food.    Thanks :)  Edit: RAOP, not ROAP :)
0	Flat broke havent ate all day live in memphis tn any help will be greatly appreciated
1	I am a recently seperated mother of two wonderful kids. My husband walked out on us for someone else and left us high and dry. I have been a homemaker for 10 years. I'm actively looking for work and awaiting foodstamp benefits. It would be fantastic if a gracious redditor could randomly pick us for dinner tonight. My account is brand new but I guess everyone has to start somewhere.

1	I'm in the Hyde Park area and would love some pizza, and would especially love seeing some more "random" acts dished out!  If pizza'ed, I promise, in the nature of being similarly random and kind, of gifting a a pizza tomorrow evening to another random requesting individual who intends to pay it forward the next day.  Want to join me in breathing more random life into this sub?  Let's make some human connections that don't end with the next person.  Additionally, if this works, I think we could generate a lot more interest, and a lot more giving, by earmarking a pay-it-forward trend as [PIF] included in the title.  More activity in general means more pizza for everyone, including [PIF]s and those who could really just use a pizza and are unsure if they can return the gift in the near future.  Here's to the random and flourishing future of RAoP!
1	I have nothing in particular to barter. I have no huge sob story. Im just a recexnt college's grad that is currently down on his luck. I am from Ft. Collins, CO and am a recent CSU graduate. Things are looking up for me. I passed the certification test to be a Pharmacy Technician so hopefully i can get a job soon. In the mean time, the generosity of a redditor is currently the only way im going to be able to eat today/.tomorrow. Thanks in advance regardless of the outcome of this.
1	It's been a tough day. I ate the last of my oatmeal this morning and haven't eaten since. Most of my last paycheck went to rent and utilities, and I don't get paid until Friday. I'm in for a rough couple of days. If someone out there can help, I'll be more than happy to comp someone else in need a pizza when I get paid.
0	We recently moved to the area and have basically been living paycheck to paycheck. She just started working again and has been kicking ass and has bailed us out a couple times and I would really like reward her with pizza. 
1	I'm not uber poor, I don't have a story to share except I'm feeling lazy as hell today.  Would love something I don't have to cook and can't remember the last time we had pizza that wasn't frozen. Any offers appreciated but if you want to give to someone else no hard feelings.   [Here's an album of kitten just b/c.](http://imgur.com/a/uErXU)  EDIT: Forgot to add, I'm in California.
0	Until payday on Friday, the only food I have in the house is white rice, and my checking account is in the red. Some pizza would really help me stretch out the week.
0	I'm a little embarrassed posting this, but I'm desperate.  Some unexpected bills came up and it's left me flat broke until Friday.  I haven't eaten since Saturday morning and it's literally starting to hurt.  If anyone can please, please help me out I would be eternally grateful.  
0	Hi all,   We just moved across Canada and are moving into our new place here in Edmonton, Alberta. Long story short, the movers completely botched our move and we are not getting our property for another week. The move has been tough on us financially and emotionally, we could use a break. Wondering if anyone out there wants to send some pizza over our way. We will return the favour in two weeks once we get settled into our new place.
0	Hello,  My name is John. I recently saw a news article from a friend about this site and thought that it was a really nice idea. I live in Chadbourn, NC and this Thursday it will be my 5 year-old's birthday and as much as I hate to tell him due to some unexpected situations I will be unable to give him anything for his birthday until next week on Friday. I was kind of hoping that a pizza would cheer him up at least. I'm not real sure how this works but I would be willing if helped, to return the favor next week when I get paid.   Thank you so much, anything would be appreciated!
0	I have a CSGO match and will be practicing until our the match at 9:00.  BUT...today is my GF day to work late and when she gets home I already know she isn't going to be in the mood to cook. Our money is tied up with xmas gifts until next pay day, so just wondering if anybody can help us out so we can get our munch on?! 
1	First time posting here, though I've checked it out a few times. The GF and I are getting a bit hungry and I'm trying to figure out what to do until payday. I've got $8 in the bank and my fridge is empty. Got 2  packages of Ramen and I get paid in 5 days. Anyone want to buy an acoustic guitar?    A pizza with lots of meat on it sounds good right about now, and once I can finally get all my bills situated then odds are I'll be back to return the favor!        Oh yeah. Pictures of fridge upon request?
0	Basically, started a new job and my pay is on backlog...so a pizza would be great. Thanks reddit!
0	No real sob story; just would love pizza as a reward for surviving my first day back (not to mention that day is 14 hours long).  Cooking later tonight (way later) sounds hellish and I can't afford to eat out or buy my own pizza.  Thank you to anyone who responds; no worries if this doesn't get picked up.
0	(or sooner. Lol) My husband and I (Newly married gay couple May 10th, 2012. (facebook.com/strit9boy).   Would like to make a pizza our Third Wheel.
0	I have been unemployed since March of 2011 through no fault of my own. I have taken odd jobs and sold everything of value. I'm not looking for sympathy, but perhaps some understanding if you've been in this situation before. Things have been bumpy for me, but I have kept faith that things will look up. I spend my days looking for work, following up on applications that I've submitted, and just trying to figure out how I'll get my bills paid. It has been mentally and physically exhausting.  My bills are paid but I am down to a few cans of peas and ramen. I won't be able to buy any food until next month. I would love a pizza and savor every single bite. You have no idea! Simple things like going to Mc Donalds or even just going out to eat at any restaurant..I haven't been able to afford to do this.   Because I'm a man with pride and work ethic, I would like to do some work for you. If you're near or in Reading, I am offering to clean your attic or do some yard work. If you're not near Reading, I will offer my computer skills to you. I can help you with anything Microsoft office related.   I am not new to Reddit, despite what the bot may say. This is my first and only request. I am seeking to work for a pizza and I hope that this is allowed. I know this is random but please consider me. Thank you for reading my post.
1	Im from Louisiana and I've just currently obtained a part-time job after being laid off for months with no expected pay until 15 days.  Been trying for many weeks with social services to obtain SNAP assistance (food stamps) and after my initial interview I managed to contact the SS office.  I was told my case was accepted and my card was on it's way; it never reached my mailbox.  I'm on the phone every morning trying to get through to my caseworker to no avail.   I've used up my borrowing resources to amend with bills and I'm running out of options until payday.  Any help would really be appreciated and certainly not forgotten.  I will return the favor to the user and/or the community; whichever preferred, and if not thanks for taking the time out to read this.  
1	You hope some kind redditor might just send you a pizza! I've never done this before but i can supply pictures of us dressed as pirates as compensation!
0	Wyoming, USA. I would love a pie right now, I'm starving.  When I get back on my feet I'll be more than happy to give back.  But for now, all I can do is ask.
0	Sold most of my records to have enough money for bills and to travel to an event in NY to sponsor. Don't NEED a pizza, but would like one. Will take care of a fellow RAOP user next week! 
0	I'm not poor in the desperate sense of the term by any means, and I absolutely respect the people that take the kindness of their heart and spread happiness in the life of one person that really can't afford a meal with something as seemingly small as a pizza. This isn't one of those posts. Truth be told, I have a crush on a girl that I invited over tonight for a simple pizza/movies/maybe a little football evening. While I don't have any cash, I thought I had a credit card handy to cover it, and tonight was the only night she'd be available for another week (student/job), but she's "really excited we could work this out tonight." So was I, until I realized the credit card expired at the end of August and I hadn't gotten my new card yet; likely shipped to my old address in Brooklyn. So on top of no food for the "date" (I'd like to think, also, no groceries due to the no money thing, paycheck doesn't come for a few days) I have no credit card as backup. No purchases for a few days it seems. I know that most people will read this and laugh at the mishaps of a hapless kid trying to chase a cute girl with poor planning, but I'm hoping that one person will relate to the irrational, and sometimes stupidly blind decisions we make when a pretty girl is excited to spend time with us. She loves chicken and pineapple pizza and I was hoping to come through with a simple surprise to make her smile off the bat. I can verify I'm a real, sane person at college with a real address that willingly accepts pizza deliveries if you want to be the ultimate wingman/wingwoman. Commit a RAOP.  I'm located in Tallahassee, FL at Florida State University, btw
0	Just found out i'm going to have to withdraw one of my classes because im not doing very well in it first year in college so stressing i hope i can make it through. In the Bronx, New York
0	I'm in my gf's appt and I'm glued to the stool. It's actually -33 C or something outside. I got to a (10) outside on the Rideau Mall terrace... Then the frostbite started coming... Ran back to the appt and am currently defrosting. Extreme munchies kicking in. Backup support requested!
0	I in no way actually expect anyone to be kind enough to do this for me, but I thought I'd give it a shot.  I'll provide some back story just so that I don't come off as a mooch. Currently sitting at home alone for the weekend, family is over 3 hours away, and my girlfriend... (or whatever she is to me after the falling out we've had over the past 2 months) is headed out for the weekend to go camping with her bestfriend. We're working on our relationship and part of that involved me moving out on my own so I could focus on myself, find a job, and seek help for my severe depression, until I've made progress towards getting my shit together she's not willing to say we're in a relationship more serious than "seeing each other" Sounds harsh, but really it's just because she wants me to prove that I'm actually going to get my shit together.  Today is one of those days where I've slumped into a depressed state, not nearly as bad as some days, but I've made progress and will continue to strive for progress. I guess my hope is that someone will be kind enough to make my day, so that when I've got my shit together I can do the same for someone that was once in my position.  Anyways before I turn this into a book with my rambling... TL;DR- Broke, Lonely, Depressed, and really hungry (I've lost 15 lbs in the past 2 weeks... =( )  
0	I'm a new father of a 10week old boy and I'm the only one working in the house. I recently got a new job after being laid off for 2 months so me and my wife and trying to get things back together. The only problem is, our money is drained right after I get paid because of past due bills from when I was laid off. Anything would help, I'd love to get my other half her favorite pizza on my first three day weekend.  By the way, I'm located in the states, Missouri to be exact. If you want proof I can send a picture of my son.
0	I'm a lurker, not a poster, so I'm not expecting much - but I thought I'd try my hand anyway! I really should go for a proper English breakfast, but I massively wrecked my knee when I was wrecked last night and now I can't even make it round the corner to the shop. No worries if it doesn't happen! Cheers :)
1	Before I start, allow me to say that I do realize that I am new here. I am not someone who is out to score a free meal, I am honestly looking for some help right now.  OK so here is my story. I apologize in advance for the giant wall-of-text.  A couple of months ago our ceiling caved in, due to excessive rain and the landlord's refusal to fix the leak. We had been telling him for months that it was not fixed and it was still leaking, but he didn't care.  So the night that the ceiling caved in, I called the landlord and I told him politely, "hey, your ceiling just fell in on us"  His exact words, were "I don't really give a damn, I don't care about anything since you said you don't owe me any money"  Now this is funny, because for years this landlord would come around EVERY YEAR at tax time, and insist we owed him some insane amount of money. We had just been agreeing in the past, because it was possible we might have missed some payments here or there.  But this time was different. He claimed we owed him 3,400 dollars for 8 months of rent that we supposedly never paid him. So I tell him, give me the dates that you think we didn't pay, and I will run them against my receipts and see what's going on.  Well, when I finally get the dates, I cross-reference them to my receipts. And it turned out that we had actually OVER-PAID the landlord by 750 dollars - plus we had all the paperwork to prove it.  So I try to explain the situation with the guy, and he refuses to listen. So he files an eviction.  We go to court with photographs of the ceiling caved in that he refused to fix, the stack of receipts, his dates that he claimed we never paid - EVERYTHING.  Well the judge's exact words were "I'm not too good with numbers, so we aren't going to get in to your stack of receipts"  The landlord also claimed that he never got the money orders, so I contacted Western Union, and I had them send me the front AND backs of them to show who they were made out to, and who signed and cashed them. Even after seeing these, he STILL claimed in front of the judge that he never got them - But they were clearly signed by him!!!  So the judge gave us 72 hours to get our shit and get out, when we were legally paid up for another 2 months........  So I had to spend 200 dollars on a storage unit, and we packed our entire lives into it. At this point, we are literally homeless. So I get a hotel room for myself, my fiancee, and our chocolate lab for the next week, just to have somewhere to sleep at night.  So that's another 200 dollars gone when we were actually paid up on the apartment and were wrongfully evicted.  After about 4 days in the hotel, we came in contact with the lady we are renting from now - she had a house available, this house - But it's 500 dollars/month for rent, plus utility costs...  Either way, we can't live out of a hotel at 200 dollars per week. So we agree and move in.  The house doesn't have a refrigerator, it doesn't have a washer/dryer. So we lived out of a cooler for the first month that we got here, until we were able to buy a cheap 75 dollar refrigerator.  This story just keeps going on &amp; on &amp; on.. I honestly couldn't type this whole thing out unless I wrote for a month.. This whole situation has just been insane.  Bottom line, I hate to ask for help. Especially like this..   But I do have photos of the entire process. From moving our things into storage to us living out of the hotel room, all the way up until we found this house, to today's rent payment.. I have the photos.. I have the receipts, I have everything...  So, the reason I am asking today is because we just spent our last 500 dollars that we had in the bank on the rent for the next month.  Neither of us gets paid for another 2 weeks.  If anyone can afford like 20 dollars or something so I could surprise her when she gets home from work with a pizza, some cheese sticks and a 2 liter of pepsi, that would be awesome.   As far as proof goes, I can provide a scanned copy of the money order for the rent that I just sent out today, it was our last drop of money. (After we were evicted illegally, I now scan the front of the money order before sending them to prove who they were made out to if any disputes should ever come up.)  I would of course blank the recipient's name out, along with the address. But I would highlight the date it was purchased (today) so you can see that I'm not just making up some sob story. I couldn't make this shit up if I tried...  So anyway, again I apologize for the huge wall of text. If someone can help us, I deeply appreciate it and thank you in advance. If not, well at least I tried. It's better to try and fail, than not try and wonder what may have happened.  EDIT: To make it easier for people who are interested in possibly helping, I have blanked-out the money order and uploaded it.   You can see it here: http://tinypic.com/r/25evg55/7  EDIT EDIT: ThumpingArnt helped me already, thank you so much.. I'm speechless right now.. 
0	It used to be that my brother and I would hang out together every Sunday, though since my niece was born, we haven't had that ability as frequently.  He is going to be here around 12pm PST (it is 9:15am currently) and I would like to have something for us to eat while he's here, though I am flat broke.  I even offer up the obligatory picture of [me with my niece](http://i.imgur.com/kvM0ISL.png) (taken just hours after she was born).  A pizza would very much be appreciated.  *EDIT - It turns out that it was a false alarm.  My brother was unable to make it here today after all, so I can have some soup.  Thanks anyway, RAOP.  I may try again one of these days.
1	http://www.facebook.com/InstituteSA/posts/270872372947463  There's the link! If I get the most likes I could win myself a sweet buffet dinner today. Help a fellow redditor out, at no cost to you, a win-win!   Thanks Guys and Gals!   EDIT: I'll post pics of me enjoying the buffet with the other winners! 
0	I really miss my best friend Brittney and I don't get to talk to her much since I am a full time student, have a 2 year old and work full time. I would love for her to know how much I miss her! 
1	I ran out of oatmeal and ramen! Please I humbly ask for any type of pizza possible. - and I forgot to add "[REQUEST]" to my last post. which is why I'm posting again... sorry and Thank you.
0	We're working on our house, and flat broke because of it.  Tonight will be spent with a lot of rental equipment and flying dust, and I know my husband would be the happiest if he could sink his teeth into a few slices of pepperoni pizza.  Anyone who can help us out?  We'd be oh-so-grateful!
1	sorry, i am a reddit noob - trying to remember all the terms of the reddiquette so i hope this is okay.  all i can say is i'm just rather short of money right now - i can't tell you how much a pizza would cheer me up while i'm writing my dissertation. it would be sincerely, humbly appreciated.  thanks for looking :)
0	This is the first time I've gone to RAoP, but I'm kind of in a bad spot.  So I have no electricity to cook anything, and I'm completely broke for the next two days.  Anything at all would help immensly, and I would be more than willing to pay back in any way, shape, or form come Friday.    Thanks a ton for reading and have a great day!
0	I'm hungry and I don't have anything to eat other than potatoes, would love a pizza. Thanks in advance.
0	Hello, I was wondering if maybe somebody out there could help me out...I know these people that got kicked out of their house, they were going to take their dog to the pound since they themselves had no place to live and i didnt want the dog to be put down or live out in the cold in utah (he would die he is tiny), they were feeding him horrible food and couldnt afford dog food so i spent of the last of my money on gas and dog food and a leash for him and now i dont get paid until thursday  was hoping somebody could help me out and i can pay it back this friday   I dont know if this will work but here is a photo of the little guy, his name is otis: (his name was gizmo but i changed it)  https://mail.google.com/mail/?ui=2&amp;ik=73f87cebbc&amp;view=att&amp;th=133a31a88fcafd49&amp;attid=0.1&amp;disp=inline&amp;realattid=1385474349507543040-1&amp;zw
0	It's currently 105 where I'm at, my car has no A/C so the drive to get anything leaves you sweatin' balls. A helpful redditor would be awesome:D 
0	please i need some sort of help from somebody with a kind heart i lost my job a month ago i was struggling as it is i'm late on the rent again and don't know when will i be able to pay it or even if i'm going to be able do it i request for a pizza not for me but for my 3 little brothers that have been eating ramen noodles for 2 weeks now and it would really brighten their day if somebody was kind enough to offer us a pizza i thank you in advance and god bless
1	I'm having a bad week, struggling with money and pizza could make it all go away... I would be extremely thankful :)
1	Hey guys,  I've heard good things about this subreddit, hopefully someone could help out with a pizza just until friday?  Recently moved and my first check was almost entirely spent getting the deposit covered for power and the last half of my move in cost.  I saw "almost" because I only have about $0.75 left until Friday.  Would someone want to help a guy out with a pizza until the end of the week?  I will gladly pay this forward the very second I'm paid again.  Thanks so much reddit!  edit: I do have a verification number.
0	I'm kind of having a terrible day. Basically, last night I went out, got drunk, and drunk texted an ex-boyfriend that I had just recently become friends with. He told my best friend, who basically told me that he was uncomfortable and I need to leave him alone. Obvious pro-tip: don't keep your phone nearby if you're drunk.   Anyway, I'm an idiot and I feel like crap and I'm a little low on cash because I have to move apartments in the middle of next month, so I have to put down rent on both places. It means a lot of nights playing Fable and eating fruit cocktail. A pizza would really help me get through the day. I've given before - and I hate asking - but I would be so, so grateful if I could get one. 
0	Title pretty much explains it all, I am in fact dirt broke, I've even started putting up anything valuable on ebay. I probably won't have a dime for another week or two, my mom also just told me she has a pancreatic tumor that has spread to her liver, I'm just down in general right now. I would love the comfort food of pizza, especially now that I can't even afford to stick to my paleo diet. 
0	My awesome Mother In Law always cooks extensive meals for the whole family and I would like to extend some kindness her way. Problem is we're too broke to buy.  Any Takers?
0	I'm trying to quit smoking so I thought I would try ecigs with a low cartridge. But so far I'm hating it and it's been a real mashed potatos kind of month, so if anyone wants to be nice and get me a pizza, that'd really cheer me up right now.
0	I'm a commercial fisherman by trade. I was injured during this last crab season and am told I won't be able to fish again because of it. I'm pretty bummed and broke. I could sure use a pizza.
0	I'm staying with a friend's family in Northern Ireland, they've been great hosts, so I'd love to treat them but I'm broke and waiting on two unpaid paycheques.   There are 3 of them + me here, I leave tomorrow.   Grateful for anyone who helps out. My friend is an avid redditor and it'd make his day to receive a RAOP 
1	Hey all, I am in a real rough patch. Hopefully for only another week or two. Basically my story is I was laid off a month and a half ago. I had a little bit of cash and my unemployment so everything was looking not great but at least ok. Well an employer from last fall is contesting the fact that they should have to contribute to my unemployment. I had the phone hearing, I know I am in the right, I got a w2 from them with taxes taken out. But until the final call is made, my unemployment checks are being withheld. It has been 2 weeks now, well 3 unemployment checks. I have been steadily looking for work. My phone got shut off the other day and I had to use $80 of my last $100 to pay it so I can receive phone interviews.   I bought some ramen and have been eating it for most of my meals for the past week now, my Thanksgiving dinner looks like more of the same.  I would really like some protein, something tasty and feel full again after a meal.  I live in Chicago, IL which has a million and a half great pizza joints but I am by no means picky, just hungry. Could anyone help a guy out? Once I find a job and back on my feet I would be more than happy to "pizza it forward" or pay you back. Thanks reddit.
0	I've had to miss work the last two days, and I can't afford to eat on my $3.47 that's in my bank account. I'm not starving, per se, but a pie would be awesome. 
0	Hi, I've gotten laid off a little bit ago, and tired of not getting any calls or interviews. I don't like giving sob stories and I feel a little embarrassed even asking for food, but would really enjoy a pizza if someone can maybe help me out. If you need any proof, I'd be glad to provide some. 
0	My house was completely destroyed in the wild fires. Up in Dallas staying with my friend who is currently unemployed if anyone could send a gift code it would be very much appreciated. I don't know when I can repay the favor to RAOP but I will at some point.
0	Wasnt really sure what to put as the title, uni student, recently moved interstate (Victoria australia to Queensland australia) am running a little low on funds till wednesday, was hoping maybe a kind stranger could order me a pizza and i can return the favour on wed?
0	I was in a recently (and abruptly) ended relationship, and my wallet is still at his house 200 miles away. I am back at my empty apartment with nothing to eat and no wallet. He won't respond to my calls or texts, and would have to send it via mail to return it to me. A simple pepperoni pizza would do wonders for me right now, and I fully plan to return the favor as soon as my wallet is returned to me.  Thank you for any consideration!
0	Lost my job on Monday and after my beginning of month bills were paid I'm completely broke until Friday when my final paycheck will come in.  Omaha, NE, there is a Pizza Hut and a Godfather's Pizza nearby that deliver. I believe there should also probably be a Papa Johns as well somewhere nearby that would deliver here.
0	Hey RAOP, this is my first time requesting, and I'll pay it forward as soon I land some work!   I'm recently back to Los Angeles after looking for work in Oklahoma (blew my 401k in the process). I'm sleeping on a friend's floor and he's gone for the weekend. All that's left in the pantry is a can of tuna and some potatoes with ears! Would anyone be willing to pizza me today? I'll love you forever!
0	No sob story here, no bullshit, I just want some pizza. If you aren't sure and you want to do something good then give your pizza to someone who "needs" it.   I'm just coming here to ask for a random act of pizza from a stranger.   I don't expect anything and definitely think that the people who really need food should be the main concern, but some pizza would cheer me up and I would really appreciate it.
0	I have just about zero in the way of extra cash, recently shelled out a bunch to move, but cooking just seems like the most daunting task in the world right now with the kiddo so miserable.  I just need me a bacon and pineapple pizza to curl up with on the couch while I nurse the baby into a milk coma.  
1	I have a couple babysitting gigs lined up next week, but I won't have a single dollar until next week. I'm trying to figure something out until then, but a pizza would last me the rest of the week. I'm in Missouri. Please, for the love of pizza, show me the good side of reddit! You all have saved me in so many ways, but this is my first time asking for a real life helping hand. Thank You!
1	Hi, I'm Hungry. (joke here) I would love a pizza of some kind. I live in Shreveport LA so the pizza joints are Papa Johns, Pizza Hut, Dominos, and Johnny's pizza (Local chain)  I don't have the money to afford a pizza nor any meals for the next 2 weeks. I won't starve or anything. I have plenty of rice and soup. I just want a real meal.  I don't have much to offer but I have a website cazes.tumblr.com and I make crazy art thingies. I'll make you some if you can gift me with pizza.   I would be eternally grateful for anything you could provide.   Love, drcazes 
0	I'm in a transitional phase where I'm looking for my first job and I can't spare any money to feed myself because all my savings need to go to my portion of the rent. My room mates are refusing to share any of the food they can easily afford with me and I'm very uncomfortably hungry. I'm not sure how this works but a friend suggested I try it and I'm offering whatever I can in way of art in return for being able to afford lunch today. I can draw animals and stuff.  Please and Thank you. Your consideration means a ton to me.
1	I am up against a rock and a hard place tonight in Buena Park CA, we are still without a home and have applied for an apt with the last of our cash on hand from a gig I did (credit/application fee). I thought I had a little more but when I went to order food for my girls I found out I didn't have it. &gt;.&lt; I will pay it all forward when our luck turns!
1	I really hate asking for handouts and if I wasn't married, I probably wouldn't bother. But yesterday, I got laid off. Not only did I not get any severance pay, my boss also gave me a 1-week, mandatory, unpaid "vacation" prior to the layoff.   They had told me to "enjoy a week off for Thanksgiving and spend time with your family." That was nice, I figured my Christmas bonus will make up for the 40-hour loss. Then I come back ready to work, 2 days later I get the boot. Keep in mind, this is 2 weeks before Christmas bonuses go out.   So I lost 1 week of pay, no severance, no bonus, and no job. My wife is a full-time college student that isn't even allowed to work (she will lose her scholarships.)  This is going to be a very tight and hungry Christmas for my wife and I. And we would greatly appreciate something good to eat so I can use what money I have left to pay bills until I find another job.  If you need proof, I'd be happy to tell you anything. We are a very generous couple and once I get another job, I would be happy to pay it forward.   Located in Eugene, Oregon  Thanks Reddit  **Edit: Thank you very much twister17 for your very generous gift! I will post pics when we get hungry. :)**
0	Hello, I am a college student studying electricity. I am 26, and recently quit my job to continue my education. I am a veteran and recieve the GI Bill, which is great, but I have stretched it a bit too far this month with the housing stipend. So, for the past few days I have been eating noodles and bread and A1 sauce. Any offers for pizza will not be unappreciated, though, I only request one. The 1st of July I hope to get a direct deposit. Please PM me for details, and I apologize for the novelty account. I have comments that I have made in the past that I would rather not be public domain.
0	My sister told me about this, last week the wife walked out on me and left the kids, she froze all the bank accounts and I don't get paid until Friday. I'd really like to cheer the kids up with some pizza. Any help would be great in these tough times.
1	as the title says i'm a uni student in darwin, australia and due to rent and a high power bill i havent been able to buy my food shopping for this week, i wont get paid for 2 days and i've run out of staples like rice etc. if anyone can lend a hand with a RaoP i would be forever greatful &lt;3
0	  I do have a couple XBOX games I dont play anymore. Halo 4 and Far Cry 3
0	I'm just looking to get a pizza. I will pay it forward on Thursday when my check comes in. 
0	edit: (San Diego Area)  I posted today telling a bit of our little eclectic family and the situation here. Thought I would try to treat everyone to pizza to cheer them up a bit if anyone's willing. Have a great night in any case!
0	Just finished a run of "The Music Man" in Monrovia, CA. Pizza appreciated.
0	I'm about to watch American Horror Story with my boyfriend. Would love some pizza. I don't have money because college. 
0	Collegedale, TN. I am trying to get my MBA, going to classes full-time and working 2 jobs. 
0	I'm broke until next week. I paid rent, car, and phone bills and have about $50 to get by on until Tuesday. First time asking, I don't really know what to expect. But thanks for reading.
0	Hi, i am not going to lie to try to get something i don't deserve, i am not dieing, begging for food, etc. but rather just wanting to know if i could get a pizza, if there is someone in need of one that has a bad situation (no food, can't feed kids, etc.) give it to them, i'd rather see true joy/happiness then just being full myself.  I can't do much in return other than draw a picture or say something or something a 15 year old can do, i can give you a free copy of portal 1 if you want.  Thanks, and i hope this doesn't turn into a flame war or something.  EDIT: Sorry, I live in Eastern TN, where sharing Netflix is illegal &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; 
1	I know I've been helped before but I've gotten into this situation again and I'm extremely stressed out. I have no job right now and I'm sick of Ramen.  I would really appreciate it if someone could lessen my burden here by cheering me up a bit and I promise I'd be able to pay it forward!  Thank you!
0	I'm in between jobs right now and am living in a house for free, as long as I get my own food since there isn't much to go around. Long story short, I'm out of savings and stuff to sell and still haven't been able to get another job, and for the past few days haven't had anything to eat. Any pizza, even if it's a small cheese, would be amazing. I can do most freshman/sophomore college level work, especially math up to calculus, if anyone would like that in return but don't really have anything else besides eternal gratitude and a promise to pay it forward when I can. Thanks for reading!
0	EDIT:  I live in Cleveland, Ohio  So, here's my story. I've been browsing reddit for quite awhile, not posting much, but constantly upvoting cool or funny stories. TIL that there's a subreddit for people to pay forward pizza. So, here we are. For the past two paychecks, I've been dead broke, paying bills. I still have to pay 300$ to my ex, 200$ to my credit card, 100$ this month for bills, and then yesterday i got four tickets, two in my moms name, and two in my aunts, for stuff I couldn't take care of at the beginning of the month. Grass, because I had no mower, and trash because people keep running over my trash cans. So I have no idea what im going to do about those yet. I'll probably have to end up paying them. As if that wasn't bad enough, it's my turn to cook for myself, and my two friends who are living with me trying to help me keep the place clean. For the past week they've been cooking delicious meals filled with juicy chicken and scrumptious ground beef. So... I would feel kind of bad just making ramen for them. So, two pizzas would go a long way. Fortunately, on this upcoming check, I have 5 hours of overtime pay, so I would be more than happy to push back the creditcard bill for a little while to return the favor. The deed doesn't need to be done for another 4-10 hours, I just figured that I would post it now so it could get some time to be noticed. Thanks in advance.  TL;DR. Got 99 problems, but paying back a nice favor ain't one. Or Have ridiculous bills to pay, city is fucking me over with four tickets for two offenses that I corrected weeks ago, and it's my turn to provide food, but all I have left to cook is ramen, and a dollar bill. Getting 5 hours overtime on payday, and can easily return the favor.   That text was copy pasta'd from r/randomactsofpizza, seeing as how I didn't know this was the real one.  More info:  One of my roommates figured out that I posted this, and he's fine with cooking until I get paid, but I would still like to give them a break on cooking for a day, or possibly two if I happen to get 2 pizzas.  Plus, I would really like to pay it forward.  So, it's RAOP's call.  :]  Pizza would be nice, but I suppose not 100% needed.  Once again, thanks in advance.
1	recently i lost my job and my apartment and because i moved to another state i cannot collect unemployment the person i was supposed to move in with backed out after i got here and now i'm stuck in the walmart parking lot with a popped front passenger tire without any money or food i haven't eaten in several days and i have nobody who i can call for help. recently i saw this site by chance and decided that it can't hurt to try. all i need is a little help thank you and god bless
0	Hey guys,  I'm a student at a pretty good university where most students are pretty financially stable. Unfortunately, that's not the case for me. I get some scholarships that help a lot, but thanks to some discrepancies I won't see any money for a couple of days. My mother is a single mom going through some financial issues because of some hospital bills and I can't bear to ask her for some cash and burden her further. So I'm turning to this subreddit in hopes of getting some warm food for tonight.  If by some random chance of fortune someone throws some food my way I'll be sure to return the favor once my scholarship money clears through.  Thanks guys
0	I'm just a poor boy attending college and no luck finding a job at the moment.  Something other than ramen noodles would be much appreciated.
0	Hi! My friend and I are crashing at our friend's place while she is on her honeymoon. We don't get paid until Christmas Eve (can prove if nec.) and are hungry. We don't have a car to drive anywhere to pick up. Would really appreciate some pizza :) Thanks a lot in advance. 
0	Just lost my job because of school. Would really appreciate a pizza for my all nighters. Thank you.
1	My wife is in the hospital and along with the costs of her surgery (she injured her eye and jaw in a car accident), the stress this has been on my 7 year old girl and 5 year old boy is extraordinary. I haven't had time to get decent food for them and a pizza would...to be honest...a blessing. Life hasn't always been this hard on my family and I eagerly anticipate the day I can pay this forward.
0	No money at the moment, hungry, and laid out in bed.  Pizza would brighten my day.
0	I moved to Canada from the states to be with her and can't work until I get my residency approved.  She's working two jobs just so she can go back to school because she **hates** what she's doing right now.    Tomorrow is our two year anniversary and I'd love to surprise her with some good pizza(and lava cakes!)
0	just short on funds until 9/19. Going to pay it forward then!
1	Hey everyone, I feel weird for posting this, but we're desperate. So, here it goes.  My girlfriend, **MuchToTheDutch**, and I both recently got jobs after three months of being unemployed new arrivals to Austin. This is awesome,but we started our jobs the 27th of June and we got paid through the 30th. This basically meant that we had just barely enough to cover our rent and bills. We've been living off rice, beans, ramen, and pasta for the last 10 or 11 days and we have to stretch it until next Monday when we get paid.  We haven't even been eating lunch; it's down to a meal a day at this point.  If some awesome person could hook us up with a pizza tonight, it would completely make our day. We'll pay it back two fold come Monday and post a follow up thread that day too.  Thanks,  **TexanInExile**  **Edit: [This is the guy I was talking about.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNZocat6NJE)**
0	It's times like this I rethink my choice to become a writer. Why didn't I ever consider the cost of pizza?!
0	Have pizza'd one person before, and it felt good, and I've had a good week personally, but a few choice encounters with some individuals this week has left me less than joyful about being part of the human race. Along with the fact that my current financial stability is about to plummet due to some big purchases that I'm just glad I was prepared for, a pretty pie would be the best. I have little to offer in return except for making balloon animals, but I'm awesome at making them! :D If you are in the area maybe we could even hit up a pizza shop together and I'll bring all my circus fun stuff. :) 
0	I work as a fundraiser for a nonprofit, (thanks to some /gw posts made a while ago, I'd prefer not to say which), and our pay and our jobs are based on quotas. I'm on review, (meaning I have two days to get my average up, or I lose what is the best job I've ever had--I care so much about what I'm doing). Additionally, partly because it's been so cold here, my average has been down--which means, so is my pay. I have about $30 in the bank to last me the two weeks until next payday, but I don't even have access to it, as it's Sunday, and my atm card got stolen. I've been working all day for this non profit, (on my feet, outside), and I'm really hungry...I just ate my last two pieces of bread today. I'm applying for foodstamps tomorrow, but, obviously, that process takes a while. One pizza would give me two meals that I didn't have to wonder about. At this point, i'm just terrified of being overdrawn on my account again, bringin nothing to my boss's going away potluck tomorrow, and not being able to afford my $25 a week meds, (not having health insurance blows). The car I drive for my company is also breaking down, and a million other little things have gone wrong lately. I have never asked anything of reddit, and I feel awful for typing out this sob story. I promise that as soon as my tax refund comes through or I get a decent paycheck, (about two weeks?), I will either pay you back or pay it forward to another redditor, whichever you prefer. My roommates are also in a bind right now, but have done there best to help me out when they could, so I'd love to be able to offer them a few slices as a thanks, and to ensure that they both eat, too. Again, I'm sorry for bitching, I know I have it pretty good compared to most of the rest of the world, (a hint to the poverty-related nonprofit I work for), but I could really use some hot food and, even more so, a kind act. Whether you can help or not, thank you for reading.
1	I'm supposed to go home in two weeks (Europe) and I lost my credit card on Tuesday. I'm working on getting it back but it's going to take a couple of days. Haven't eaten anything but spaghetti with pepper the last two days so if anyone is feeling like buying me a pizza I promise to return the favor when I get my card back!  Edit: I got a gift card for a couple of pizzas! Reddit you're amazing!
0	It's payday. Money is in the bank. My old card was lost and I'm waiting on a replacement. Unfortunately It's kind of hard to buy pizza with a checking account. Someone mind hooking me up and I'll pass it on once the card comes in?
1	My buddy told me about this sub-reddit just a moment ago and I thought it was silly. I guess I'll post a request but if nobody replies that's great too. (I hope there aren't any rules that I'm missing if I did please let me know.)
1	I'm currently sitting at work with an empty stomach and an emptier bank account. I'm struggling to stay afloat, but a full docket of bills and college expenses have me running thin this month. I get paid next Friday, and I can give you the promise that I will pay it forward, one way or another.  EDIT: Thanks, mvs5191! You are truly awesome!
1	My brother told me about this site a while ago. After looking at other entries, I'm blown away. I hope someone can extend their Random Acts of Pizza Kindness to my family and me. I don't want to make anyone sad, but the side says to be honest. My wife was killed in a car accident a year ago last week. She was an amazing mother and wife. Readjusting has been really hard, but our kids are tough and are working through it. I have an amazing support system, but sometimes things just don't add up. My parents and her dad are incredible and do so much for us, but I hate asking them for help. They already do so much and it's really embarrassing not being able to give my kids something as small as pizza. Normally we do a "pizza" night once a month, but with school just starting, I'm coming up short. I hate asking for help, but it seems like a really open and friendly environment, so I'd like to try. I can't wait to pay it back next month. I'm thinking the kids can pick a contest and the winner. Thanking you from the bottom of my heart. Jim
0	Got bashed last night and had my wallet and phone stolen. Got no money  a broken big toe and a splitting headache. Someone please help a hungry poor man out?
1	I'm broke until the 28th and I wanted to make her birthday special this year because last year was the day she found out my dad had a new girlfriend. :\ Anyway, basically, my mom deserves a good day to relax and since we can't throw her a little party, we're hoping to get some pizza from either of her favorite places. Boston Pizza or East Side Mario's.  Edit: Pizza for my mom, brother, and I. (Edit 2: cleaned up the post.)
0	You know the feeling. Home alone besides the company of homework, three dogs, and the "nothing to eat" feeling. Will pass it on when I get the chance :)
0	We're a young couple in California struggling to get by.  The good news is we're both working again and my first paycheck comes next week!  However, I'd be understating the situation if I said our bank account was merely empty.  We're looking for a kind soul to provide a meal for us this evening.  In exchange, we're thrilled to use part of that first pay check to send a pizza to TWO hungry people next.  What a wonderful system, and we're hoping it'll work for us.  Please touch base with us and we'll give you whatever information you need.  Thanks so, so much, and we look forward to, well, paying it forward!
0	Hey all, student in southern California here, and I'm pretty short on cash for now. I've been limiting myself to a meal of macaroni/ramen a day to save some money. A 'za would be pretty bomb-diggity right now, as would be the kind person who might lend me a hand in this scenario. Much gratitude to anyone who considers -- I'm hoping one day I'll be the one in a position to give out pizzas here. Thanks for reading.
0	All I have is ramen in the house, would love some pizza.  No one wants to hear a sob story, so just save me from the monotony of ramen.
1	$0.33 in bank account, savings restricted due to online transfer limit being reached, and not getting payed for 10 days. I work and am in class constantly, but I barely make ends meet. This month is exceptionally bad for me and I haven't had constant access to food. Any help would be appreciated!
1	Hi, not something I have done ever, but here it goes.  I got done with my exams 2 weeks ago and wasn't able to work as much as I would have wanted to during this past 30 days, after paying off my rent all my bills, I have just been left enough money for the bus fare to and from work for the next week and I can't spend that, I've got some rice and bread and PB and stuff, but that's only enough to last me a few days, so I was wondering if anyone could buy me a papa johns? That would be a nice fulfilling meal for a change.  Since I get paid in 8 days, i.e next Friday, I promise to pass the pizza love to someone who need's it like I do now, I guess that's the whole point of this subreddit.  Anyway, thanks for reading.   **EDIT: Pictures.**  http://i.imgur.com/zghop http://imgur.com/sJSnC http://i.imgur.com/HWG8l http://imgur.com/J1qUI
0	My wife and I have been having a pretty stressful week, and we're very low on food right now.  We're managing, but we're pretty much out of cash until I get paid in a week.  On top of that, my wife had to go to the ER this morning, and she's a little loopy from the medication and the pain.  We would love to just chill out tonight and have a pizza, but that's not an option for us right now.  If there is a kind Redditor that can help us out with our pizza craving, we would appreciate it so much.  Thank you!  :)
0	Hey guys, hoping that someone can help me out. I just got my last check of the summer and every dime of it just went to my first month's rent, leaving me with no money and nothing but ramen until I move in next week. Frankly, I don't want ramen anymore, so I'm asking you guys if I could get some help to start my last full weekend of the summer before school starts. I will **definitely** return the favor once I move in and find a job. You can hold me to it! Oh, I live about 30 mins outside of Charlotte, NC.
0	I'm a BU student and can hardly afford groceries, let alone pizza. A real hot meal would mean so much and I appreciate anything any redditors here can do.  Peace and love,  midnightwalrus
0	Hi!  First time requesting pizza.  My husband and I are in between pay periods and a surprise (but I guess not too surprise) car insurance bill zapped us of literally all of our money.  We have only bread and butter as meal substitutes until payday (this Thursday), we just wiped out the last of the dried beans.  So a pizza would be like, the best treat for our bellies.  Thank you so much! Poutina + Poutina's Husband  Edit:  Whoops!  We are in South Jersey and EST zone.
0	I'm writing a paper about Minorities in Imperial Germany, and all I've had in my apartment is cans of tuna. I swear to God this fish will be the death of me.   In return I will answer any burning questions you might have about Poles, Danes, Sorbs, Alsace-Lorrainians, Jews, or Catholics in the years between 1871 and 1918 in the nation of Germany. 
1	Hey guys,  This is a throwaway account, I'm more than willing to go through the verification system if need be.    I could really use a helping hand right now.  I've been unemployed for 6 months now, haven't been able to find much work in Birmingham other than some manual labor.  I'm not complaining, I'll do anything I have to support myself.  I'm trying to cut out all expenses in my life, got rid of my phone, internet, sold my tv, so I'm in the library using their internet and their AC.  To add insult to injury, rubbing dirt on the wound, I had to put down my chocolate lab over the weekend.  Layla was getting old, she was a great lab, and I'm torn up inside right now.  I know it's childish, but I would love to sit down with a nice pizza, something I haven't had in as long as I can remember and just kinda zone out, at least for the night.
0	Hi, my friend has been in the hospital for over and month. She's been fed terrible hospital food. I want to treat her with pizza so she has something to look forward too. Can someone please donate $20 dollars so we can share a decent meal. Thank you
0	I think its gotten to the point where the lack of food is keeping me from sleeping soundly at night. I can't think of any other reason why I only slept 3 hours last night.  I get off work today probably around 3pm but the money just covers rent and gas and I have to drive an hour home. My alma mater is playing football at 7pm tonight and I'd just really enjoy a pizza and some breadsticks or soda from Dominos or something for dinner for once.  I actually feel terrible asking for a meal... I should have just foregone this... 
0	Hi Reddit! I never thought I'd be posting one of these. Here's my story. I came down to visit my girlfriend Thursday night. Everything was going good until this morning. We got in a huge fight and she gave me the boot. Where I live is an approx. 45 minute drive.  I pretty much feel like a bum, but I don't know what else to do. I'm at a public library using the computer with a visitor's pass. I've only got 45 min left. Surprise me Reddit, please!  Edit: I've figured out where I'm staying tonight. I'll be off and on all night checking this, hoping this works out.
0	We are so desperate for food, we have tried on 3 seperate accounts to obtain a pizza. Now look into your heart, and please make the right decision. We arent trying to be greedy. Just honestly hungry, And mean, its fucking snowing outside.. Isn't that bad enough. :(
1	I'm a biomedical engineering student at a university in New York. This is finals week, and I ran out of my meal plan last Friday. I've just been living off my friends for the past few days, and I would love to be able to share slice to repay them.  Yay for surviving math &amp; science finals!
0	Hey guys, 2 stressed out students need your help! Starting final exams tomorrow and the revision isn't going well! One of us is reading Ulysses all tonight and the other is trying to learn statutes and cases off! Very stressed out and panicked over these exams! Will be pulling an all-nighter for tomorrow so would appreciate a pizza to save us cooking time! We will return the favour once exams end and we can earn money again!  Thanks :)
0	We're not going to make up a sob story. We are both are employed full time and going to college full time, and thought it would be fun to give this a try. We would be more than happy to pay-it-forward should this work!
0	Hey guys, so I started my summer courses and i've been trying to find a job but have had no luck so far. My money situation is looking kinda bad and I would really appreciate it if I could get a pizza to hold me off for the rest of the week. This is my first time so once I find a source of income I promise I'll fulfill someones request. Thank you so much!
0	I don't have a big long sob story, but I do owe a friend a bit of money for helping me with food a little bit back, and since I found this, what better a way to do it?
0	Listening to 45:33, hence the title. Anyone feeling particularly generous? I can draw you a picture, or tell you a story, or anything really. I've won a few contests, but never received a pizza. My roommate and I would be super grateful, as we'll be up all night working on our script for a Blaxploitation Zombie Comedy film (sure zombies are played out, but who cares).   Much love to you all and the community.
0	My SO and I are moving to the new apartment tomorrow which has put us in the poor house (paid first and last months rent upfront) so we currently have a combined total of $0.65  We've been frugal with food, meaning lots of rice and KD, but our dishes / food are packed up and my midnight prego cravings have hit hard.   And Pizza Pizza closes in an hour. D:  Anyone care to donate a pepperoni pizza? Pretty please!
0	We will compose and record ( not professionally but in a decent manner) an original song that you can pick the title, topic, and even give us other songs you want us to use as inspiration! This will include Lyrics, Vocals, Drums ( electronic) Guitar, and Bass The song will be sent within a week of pizza!
1	I finished the last of what I have. I'm a student without anything to eat today and a pizza would really help right now =\
0	It is 9:16 on a Friday night. I'm a senior in college and I am trying to get out, which is why I am working rather than partying.  edit: working and redditing
1	I spend my days making magic for little kids at DisneyQuest. Between car payments and housing, I'm at about 48cents in my back account right now. I'm hungry and just got home from a nice 10-hour shift and I was hoping someone out there would be willing to feed me. I'll return the favor or pay it forward anyway I possibly can. Any redditor in the Orlando area wanna get into Disney for free? I'll hook you up. :]  [My Disney name tag](http://hphotos-sjc1.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/264710_1626693143620_1125270824_31873134_8125879_n.jpg)  [I get to wear a cool costume too](http://a4.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/227890_1573589896072_1125270824_31806294_2054237_n.jpg)
0	Minimum wage, overnight part time convenience store/gas station clerk because the economy in WA state is really terrible.  Even for myself, as a thirty year old with a degree (well, a two year but its not nothing).     My favorite is what my friend has dubbed "girly pizza" (I assume because theres no meat) but I would stuff anything in my fat face gladly &lt;3
0	Anyone generous enough? :)
0	Today's my 28th birthday. And it's 10/11/12. Much to celebrate, in my opinion. I'm hungry and need something to help me celebrate. :)
0	I just joined this site after hearing about it on the radio, and I love random acts of kindness (especially when food is involved) and was hoping to get into the circle. When I'm back home, I'm very happy to give a pizza to someone, but right now I'm not in the situation to do that.  We drove all the way from Washington, DC to Portland, OR and are heading to Seattle, WA soon. We're living off of chips and water. A warm pizza would be...awesome. Very awesome. If someone could help, I'd be super happy to have some real food after a week of nothing. Neither of us have any money to really buy more food.
1	Oahu, HI. EBT maxed, broke. tired of PB&amp;Js. Will return the favor in 4 days if needed.
1	The roads were exceptionally frozen this morning after a horrible rain last night. My car slid into someone elses, and caused a lot of damage. I have no collision insurance, thus I will have to pay out of pocket and alas, do not have the means to do so.  My car is now at a shop getting an estimate done, and I am at home with no food and no means to go out and get something hot to eat. Anyone willing to help me out with a pizza? I can surely either pay it back or pay it forward once I am more aware of my financial situation. 
0	I am a complete wimp when it comes to the dentist, to the point where I get IV sedation for something as simple as a routine checkup, even though it really doesn't seem to help. Today will be my first ever root canal so needless to say I am extremely nervous because of all of the "horror stories" I have heard from others who have had root canals.  A pizza obviously wouldn't make me any less nervous about the dentist but it would help make my day a bit better and would be very much appreciated. I promise to pay it forward when I start working in a few weeks.
1	I'm a 22 year old student out of Topeka, KS, majoring in accounting and finance. I am currently on the hunt for a 2nd job that'll pay for tuition, books, and the other expenses life presents me. As my current job barely covers rent and utilities, food has kinda taken a back seat for me. I know I'm new on here, but I have been a long time member on other web sites like Slickdeals.net, which showed me how to save money on groceries thru Amazon.  I am hitting up a temp agency today to see if I can find an immediate solution to my money quandaries. If I am successful in supplementing my income, I will gladly return to do my part in keeping the wheel of Pizza graciousness spinning. My birthday is coming up on the 14th of July, and I have always felt more comfortable with giving than receiving on my special day. Like a hobbit.  It would be such a blessing to not have to worry about where my next couple meals are coming from.
0	Not in any circumstances where i need food just a college student in NE Iowa with a craving for some pizza because of my cafeterias weak attempts to make it.
1	We are moving from TX to WA the day after tomorrow. All of our belongings were packed and shipped yesterday so we have nothing to cook with and all of our money has been spent on the movers and plane tickets. If anybody would be willing to get us a pizza it would be greatly, GREATLY appreciated!  Can provide proof If needed. Thanks so much :)
0	Hey RAoP,  My situation is that I just finished a term in AmeriCorps (http://www.reddit.com/r/americorps) now I'm looking for work and picked up a class to teach at a college, but it doesn't even cover my rent so I'm still looking for a full-time job.  I ran out of food this month because I was sharing my food stamps with another AmeriCorps to tide him over (he's a wiry guy that ate like a horse, and I'm just a wee 120 lb gal that doesn't need that much, so it made sense at the time).  I'm down to 5 packets of ramen, but new funds come in on the 5th so I really just would like to get through this weekend and also feel a bit less depressed while job hunting and lesson planning.  If you could please send me a pizza, it would make my night!  Thank you.  Hopefully someday soon I'll be the one sending out the pizza.
0	I got the money but I'm stuck at work. Would anyone brave the mean streets of Dearborn, MI to bring me a Little Caesars Hot and Ready? I can pay pal you the cash in front of you, or charge my register the amount.  To be clear, you only need to purchase the pizza upfront and I will be happily pay you the 5.30 for it.
1	Here's my pitch:  I'm a sophomore at Yale University, and I've got a long week ahead of me - I've got a fundraiser to run in New York City, I'm going to be without my laptop for a week while it is being serviced, and classes are actually making us do work now.  I could go on and on about my firstworldproblems, but I think you get the picture.   What I'm asking for tonight is what I think will be a fair exchange.    1) YOU ... provide the food. New Haven is arguably the pizza capitol of the world (I can hear the hisses already), and so there's plenty of pizza places out there we can set this up for, however... There is also a really awesome website called OneButtonWenzel.com that allows you to a press a single button and order the ultimate buffalo chicken sandwich.  It's cheap, its easy, it supports a business - a great deal for you.  2) I... Will do my best to give you a fair shake. I'm not going to make some sort of pitch that you're helping a dying college student over here - we do have a meal plan and everything, so I want to give you something of substance.  I will photograph the consumption of your order, while confirming as many Ivy League/Yale stereotypes as possible.   AS A BONUS If you order two (2) WENZELS, my whole SUITE will get in on the action! That's right, you'll have a pictures of a room full of WASPY New England folks enjoying the delicious late night meal you have provided.  Offers like this don't come around every day - now is the time for food.  I hope you'll join me in this venture.   EDIT: Zombica has been kind enough to provide us with food, and so we'll do our part to provide the pictures while we are waiting for it to arrive. Delivery here is totally random, so it could be until 2:00am before they deliver - if that's the case, it is a risk we are willing to take.  EDIT 2: The Wenzels arrived, and they were awesome. Check out the pics below, and give Zombica as much karma as possible - she is the best, and totally made our week.
1	I take a pill form of Chemotherapy for my Leukemia (cml) and I have absolutely no food that is gonna sit in my stomach and be enough besides an expired mini bag of pretzels. I would really appreciate a pizza. From anywhere. I know places close soon so this is really my last option for food tonight. 
1	OP WILL deliver with pics vÃ­a PM. 
1	I had my hours cut at work from 40 to 24 a week. For this reason I am very broke right now, and going to move back in with my father in two weeks. I only have $4, and being Gluten Free I don't have many options with that much money (No options really). If someone could send a gluten free pizza my way, I would be very thankful, and purchase one for somebody on Friday when I get paid. If you are wondering how to get a gluten free pizza, Dominos does a great job with it. Not sure if Pizza Hut or anyone else does gluten free, but I trust Dominos. Please let me know if you are able to help me out today, I could really use some food! Thanks in advance!
0	Please help me get back at them and also get something to eat.
0	I've recently been put on a rather large project from my employer. Combine that with trying to learn some light web development and trying to improve my understanding of XHTML and CSS 3.0, and I am put in a position where it seems like I have no free time. Money has been tight, so while I have a budget that keeps me fed, it's mostly just rice and other odd little things that don't cost a whole lot. I think if someone were awesome enough to gift me a pizza right now, it would help me stay sane right now. :)  Would certainly pizza it forward after this large project is done near the middle of the month (right before Christmas it seems).  Would also be willing to assist someone in simple or perhaps slightly complicated HTML/CSS work if requested. I'm sure I can find a little bit of time to answer questions or give advice. That's pretty much my forte. Just don't ask me about jQuery. That seems to be my kryptonite!
0	Hey, me llamo David, and I attend Full Sail University Online and live in Florida.  My living expense check is sent out on Thursday, but my roommate doesn't get paid until Friday, so I was wondering if someone could gift us a pizza?  I can return the favor in a week or two, or I'll pay it forward to someone else.    There are some pretty good deals for large pizzas here at our local pizza hut.  I'm easy to appease.  Don't even need any toppings if it's cheaper.   Thanks ahead of time.  Raaaaawr.  I'm fluent in velociraptor, and that was "thank you".  Or "you smell of feet", those two phrases are pretty tricky.    Also, my bank account, for your viewing pleasure. Mock the poor boy.    http://oi43.tinypic.com/ny68zk.jpg  EDIT: So it kinda sounds like I want a bunch of pizza.  Just one.  We don't eat much, so it should last until tomorrow.  
0	So, I am a web developer who was laid off a bit ago. I am working again, but I am broke and won't see any money til the end of the month. So here is my proposition. Hook me up with some pizza and I will write some code do do something simple.
0	I cannot stand the idea of turning on the oven and heating the house more, and I'm low on groceries anyway.   If anyone could help out, my boyfriend, son, and I would greatly appreciate it!
0	I would really appreciate any help that someone can offer. I am with two friends studying for our last nursing final, tomorrow morning. Graduation is so close and yet money seems to continue being a month to month struggle. Again, anything will be greatly appreciated!  P.S. I told my friends about reddit and they had never heard of it. I showed them how it works and how entertaining it is. They love it, but they don't believe that random acts of pizza actually occur. I even showed them pictures, but they won't believe me. Anyone want to help me out with proving how awesome reddit really is too?   
0	Me and my lady are broke and hungry. We're between paydays, and I just shelled out the last of my cash to get back into classes. If some wonderful redditor would lend a hand I'll pay it forward as soon as I can.
0	Broke art student looking for a meal. Hook a kid up please &lt;3
0	Hello RaoP,   I don't usually beg for stuff, but I don't have anything to eat today. I've spent all of my dining hall meals this week since I was busy studying and ate an easy three meals a day. It payed off though because I got an A in two classes. Gah, I'm rambling. The only thing edible I have in my room is coffee. I like coffee. Anyway, why not give this a shot.   Ducks
0	I am a single mother of three who is attending school full time and working part time.  I just applied for food stamps and it will be about three weeks before it comes in.  I do not have a car so I have no way to get to the food pantry that my kids school suggested. I don't get paid until next friday and am really really craving pizza.  (I don't have all the ingredients to make my own) 
1	I'm happy to sing for my supper, here's my story so far in handy bullet points:  * moved to another city to stay with a friend who assured me I could stay until I found a job  * friend changed their mind after two weeks and kicked me out  * managed to find a room in the house of a friend of my parents   * paying $150 a week, no income, is supposed to include food but no food in the house  * to top it all off I'm still unemployed!  So yeah, after paying for food there is nothing to eat. There's no Internet here (my smartphone is my saviour) and my email inbox is full of rejections from jobs I've applied to. Even the local supermarkets aren't hiring!  I would definitely appreciate some cheering up in the form of a pizza if any redditor felt like helping me out :)  [Bonus pic of empty fridge](http://i.imgur.com/3J2oj.jpg) (bowl is dog food)
0	I'm a student doing summer classes in Farmville Virginia, I left for the weekend and forgot to shut my fridge all the way and everything went bad. A pizza would last me the rest of the week! :) 
0	Had a roommate randomly leave after loosing his job last week, leaving me to fend for myself. I'm doing ok, but have run short on money because of this!  Hoping RAOP can help us out for tonight!  I'll send a lovely pic of me and her for the pizza!
0	I work for a section of my university that cleans windows. They have been trying to shut us down for a while since we don't bring in money just cost it. We had a meeting with our boss and she Informed us that we will not have jobs after this week.   We where told the reason why was no room in the budget. Well I don't have room in my budget to not get a pay check anymore. Thank you for helping and thank you for listening. 
0	I'll try to keep this short and to the point. I just recently moved, I'm broke, my car is giving me issues, and a mess of other stuff. I'm in a great mood right now though! A pizza would just send me over the top. If you really just want to make a dumb kid (I'm in my 20's) happy, I'm your guy. Thanks a lot. If you want any more info you can message me.
0	My girlfriend decided it would be a good idea to get off at Perth bus station when she was coming to visit me and has since had to spend all her money on a taxi to get to me here in Dundee. Any chance some kind soul would get us some pizza since we don't have any cash anymore?
0	Me and one of my college friends have been living on little to nothing this past weekend till I can get my next paycheck (I work at a writing help center).  Would anyone like to make tonight's Game of Thrones episode watching 10X better?  The nearest joint is a Pizza Hut in Fulton, MS.
1	Just what the title says. Could really use a RAoP. My birthday is a week from today, we could consider it an early birthday gift. I did post once on Sunday night, and didn't get a response. I'm in a new place, and bills are stacked up high. Thanks in advance for anyone who sees this.
1	I got hit with some unexpected bills this paycheck, and don't have the funds for food right now. A pizza would last me two or three days, so I'm swallowing my pride and posting here. I can return the favor in a few weeks!  edit: pizza received, thanks to afriendlysortofchap
0	I would love a pizza to keep me thru the day, I just discovered this subreddit and I would definitely love to repay the favor!
0	Just want pizza for watching amines with tomorrow. Example:  [Man painting picture of dragon riding airplane using pizza as palate.](http://imgur.com/GDcKUKP)

0	I'm a student at the University of Arkansas.  There's a gaming lab here on campus called the Student Technology Center.  The staff there does more than just run the gaming lab, though.  They're responsible for tech support all over campus.  These guys work part time, nights and weekends, for minimum wage, and get tons of shit every day from a really thankless and entitled student body.  I wanted to order them some pizza to thank them for what they do, but I'm broke.  Was hoping maybe RAOP could help out.
0	Today is my boyfriend's 18th birthday. I'm not able to see him today (sadly) and I want to send him something to let him know I'm thinking about him. Flowers and chocolates are typically for girls. Haha. He loves pizza. This is perfect. Does Reddit wanna help? 
1	hey there- I have a special request. Sunday afternoon I am driving from NH to Baltimore to see a lupus/antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) specialist at John's Hopkins as APS is pretty rare and I have been pretty sick recently and getting worse, not better.   A friend I actually met through a couch surfer I hosted has become like a surrogate dad to me and is flying here from California to drive me down- he is an incredible person and I owe him my life. He does so much for me and has agreed to drop everything to make sure I get the care I need to get well.   Anyhow, he is paying for everything for this trip- including the visit if I can't get any financial aid help (have submitted an application) as I don't have insurance. I can't tell you how blessed I am to have this man in my life.   Other than gratitude I have nothing to offer him as I am very broke due to my illness keeping me from working despite trying desperately to get well enough to resume my career.   Can anyone arrange to have a pizza delivered to where we are staying either Sunday night when we are due to arrive or Monday for after my appointment? I think he would appreciate it and I know I would more than words could say!  I am still not sure where we are staying yet or exactly when we are arriving but I can let the giver know the exact details as soon as I know. I am hoping to stay Sunday with a friend from high school in nearby Elkhorn but if not it will be a hotel close to JHMC. Subsequent days will definitely be in a hotel (I will be outpatient, not in patient).   Many thanks for even reading and considering this!
1	Hi,  I live in Glasgow, UK and I have no money to buy food until Monday. I am hungry. Could a kind Redditor please order me a pizza today from http://www.dominos.co.uk   The pizza costs Â£11.49. I have about Â£3.25 in my paypal account I can send you.   The pizza I would die to eat right now is:  Meatilicious Pepperoni, ham, chicken breast strips, smoked bacon rashers, cumberland sausage  Looks like this: http://imgur.com/fFxxt  Small (6 slices), Â£11.49  Can anyone help?
0	I'm a big fan of The Walking Dead and today was the last episode before the season finale. I hope I get the TV fixed  before Doctor Who! If someone would send a pizza, I'd be very greatfull. Also, payday is next week, so I can pay for someones pizza then.
0	Lost my job a month ago, 50 cents left in my account. Girlfriend had a tax return coming that she waited this long for and it turns out her student loan offset it so that sucks. I owe $160 in bills and have no idea how I'm going to pay my $600 rent. No luck on the job front after a month. And on top of that, I can't get unemployment because the company that let me go for *some* reason still says I'm employed there so I can't get unemployment benefits. So I'm wrestling with that, waiting for someone to return my call after I sent them all the termination paperwork I was given. Literally no food left in the house, it's gonna hurt like hell but I'm thinking of pawning my guitar tomorow to keep us afloat for a week or so. OH, and her car broke down. Today of all days. My girlfriend told me to try posting here, I'd asked once before but it didn't work out and this years been *roooough*. But it seems like everyone's on hard times so I understand if my story isn't sad enough. You don't even have to buy me a pizza, just tell me it'll all be okay.  EDIT: Should also mention, Girlfriend's employed in a cafe at a local college, but it's closed this month so she's temporarily out of work as well. She's overdrawn about 40 or so so she's in even worse shape than I am. What a day.
1	So, RAoP, I've been unemployed now for 4 months, barely getting by on my unemployment. Surviving, but the jobs aren't looking up. Anyone that can help or be kind, I'd love it. You'd make my week. 
0	My wifes and mine bank account were frozen due to someone hacking them and trying to steal money but now we don't have any money or food for a couple days can someone square us away with a pizza.
0	I got a little over ambitious with my Christmas gift spending this year for my family and girlfriend and now I'm out of money until I get my paycheck tomorrow at my internship. I'm at work now and I would have to be here for 10 more hours without food unless I get help. I was hoping someone could help me out since I work right next to a Pizza Hut and could run over there to grab some lunch and dinner. Thanks for any help!
0	I'm hungry in Virginia! My stomach is makin' the rumblies that only a cheese pizza can satisfy. Hit me up! Plus I want to show my friends that if you tell the driver to draw a wizard on the box in the special instructions, he'll totally do it. I've got 0 dollars. &lt;3 http://imgur.com/KlUSB
0	Hello all. We would love a pizza if anyone is able to assist. I'm broke for the next week and the pantry is very low. Normally we don't have any problems but unforeseen events happened. I wouldn't worry to much except I have a two year old. Any help would be great, thanks for taking the time to read this.  
1	im a rugby player, and im due to start my last season for my college team in a month. sprained my ankle in july playing soccer, just got an MRI due to the persistant pain, and found out i shredded a ligament. its possibly surgical, and when i told my new boss, he said hed have to let me go because im on crutches and im 'a risky investment.' i had just paid my rent with the last of my savings yesterday before my doctors appointment, and i have $10 till tuesday [also my birthday]. just a little bummed and hungry--id really appreciate a meal, and id be happy to provide any sort of verification needed. thanks for reading. 
0	I'm in Ohio. This would be a surprise for my niece since she's craving it. She's in 6th grade and busy playing PC games to escape the craziness.  Editing for info:  Google tells me its "Paradise, NV". This would have to be a delivery (personal or by pizza delivery service).  Mom moved out there to marry a millionaire. He passed away. The money's all gone. She can't physically work. She's been through a lot more than this, but this whole situation makes her feel lost. She's a trooper, though.  Sis moved out there because she needed help taking care of her daughter.  I'm in Ohio living with my boyfriend and his family as we both attempt to get (new) jobs and get into college. I moved out here when I was 22, I'm 24 now.  Mom can't pay the bills, and I'm trying to get her involved in community things. My sister applied for state assistance and is waiting for it. They have a bit of elbow pasta, ketchup and some bread. She wanted me to call my dad, so I went to reddit lol. My niece needs the ROAP, and my sister &amp; mom need to eat.
0	I was working at a job where I was getting 25-40 hours a week when they suddenly knocked my hours down to 5-18. It took me five months to find this job and work is hard to come by around my area. Also, my girlfriend just got diagnosed cervical cancer so she cannot work. What little food I have left in my house is until my food stamps come in the first week of October. I have some paycheck stubs as proof, but I do not feel comfortable showing them around because of my personal information thats on there. Please help us not eat canned stew tonight again. 
0	Ok I am a college student and I live in a dorm but I don't have any money and I have been starving for 2 days already. The only way I'm not on the floor dying of hunger is because I have been drinking a LOT of water. I do have a job but most of that money goes towards paying for the school and the rest for food but I get payed next friday. I would really appreciate it if someone would buy me a pizza and when I do get payed then I will gladly return the favor. 
1	I appreciate all of you.
0	No great sob story here, just some students getting ready to go back to uni in a few weeks looking for pizza to brighten up a very rainy Sunday evening.
0	Before I give details, I want to apologize for my previous request. I'm desparate for pizza, and bored out of my mind, so I may have possibly made a bogus request looking for pity. Then a friend told me I was an idiot and I should be honest, so I deleted that and made this instead. (Bad first impression is bad. :/ )   So I'm off tomorrow, and the 'rents don't get paid for another week, so we have gatorade, brocolli, and ramen for food, and I'm in a desparate mood for a pizza right now. I'll eat anything, really, so don't worry about giving me the wrong type or size; I'll eat it. I've got $1.90 to my name, so I can't afford water, much less a pizza. xD  In Missouri, USA. PM if you're willing to help a Reddit/Internet-addicted brother out.  And again, sorry 'bout the bogus request a bit back. When I crave, my stomach thinks for me.  Edit; I managed to get a friend to hook me up with something, but thanks anyways guys (not to whoever downvoted me. Thanks fo nothing, &gt;.&gt;).
0	I'm a host that works a food service job that doesn't offer a discount or allow you to eat in their restaurant. I'm part of the only dept. in the restaurant that doesn't get tips. I just worked OT on my Friday (which I won't see a penny of until payday next week) and I have two packets of ramen to subsist on, currently, with about $1.29 in the bank. I'm hungry. :(  I can provide some modicum of proof if needed, and I will eagerly return the favor someday  if anyone would be willing to help out. Thank you, and my grumbling tummy thanks you.   
0	We are currently looking for work and later today, we could really use a pizza. We understand that it would need to be paid forward at a later date and we're cool with that. We've considered foraging in the forest or going to a food bank, but a random act of pizza would get us through the next two days or so. 
0	I really hate to ask to ask because I'm such an independent person, but I got "laid off" (Problems with my boss, I won't get into it..) a few weeks ago and I've just been coasting on savings trying to find a new job. I'd be happy to entertain any requests or anything that could bring some happiness to someone's life as compensation for doing the same for me. 
0	I work in Freemont, because of rent I am already broke even after I get paid on Friday.  Pizza would be amazing, you can only eat so much ramen you know.
0	Fucked up on my last post so apologies for that. But I have [this] (http://i.imgur.com/7MuMBND.jpg) Texas Chainsaw Massacre poster I did awhile back but I'm starving right now so thought I'd offer a trade! This 20x30 in. poster for some pizza? :D   Currently in California  Edit (for the mods): Sorry for the mixup! wont happen again.
0	So as I stated above its rent time and there is no food in the house. I just need to hold off for a few days til payday but a pizza would help the week go quicker. I am from Southern California. Never done this before but I will definitely pay it back once I have a bit more leeway in my budget.
0	This is my first post ever, I'm not totally sure how this site works. Anyways, I found this subreddit and thought you guys might be able to help us. My fiance and I... well, we're poor. We live in my mom's (finished) basement. He hasn't had work in 3 weeks and had to give his truck away. We also have a sweet 8 month old baby boy, who makes me smile every day. I am breastfeeding, though, and I worry I'm not getting enough calories.   We are in Michigan.
1	Posting here in hopes of pizza. Bit of a story!  Husband works CONSTANTLY to support us. right now I'm 23 weeks pregnant (see r/babybumps) and after moving back into our apartment due to MIL troubles we're broke til next payday. It's my fault that we're broke which is why I'm secretly posting here while husband is at work and cannot see it. Insurance refuses to cover my prenatal now for some reason so our spare food/gas money has gone to those.   I am out of work sadly (was collecting SSI for my disability but they cut it off as soon as I got pregnant and no one wants to hire a pregnant woman even for a temp :(  )  So just hoping for a meal for when husband comes home from work :(
1	So, I'm apartment sitting for a friend of mine, in College Park MD, and since it's summer, the college-apartments are pretty much empty. And I'm broke, with no car, so I can't buy food and even if I could I'd have no way to get there. r/raop, can you help?
0	I have food in my house, just not much, or a decent variety. I've been having English muffins/buttered toast, and pasta with Alfredo sauce for the last few days, and there isn't much else to eat. I'd really just like to have a pizza for dinner. :) If you can think of any kind of (free) digital gift I could give you (something bitchin' on Photoshop, for example, or maybe some photos of my puppies), let me know, it'd be the least I could do.  Thanks in advance!
0	I am making this request because my wife and I just relocated from California to here. Do not get our first checks for another week and are negative in our bank accounts, I would love to surprise her with a hot meal tonight. 
0	The boyf &amp; I have about $15 until Thursday, which has to be put towards gas for getting to work. I am having a crap time lately and especially today I could really use some kindness and food. My dream would be pizza from my favorite local place, two because the boyf is not a veggie person, but let's be honest...I'd take anything. 
1	 I'm kind of struggling today so If anyone could help me out that would be the best!
0	Two families living together 10 people 4 adults 6 kids ages 11, 11 , 9, 7, 6 , 4 would love some pizza tonight we're broke and being evicted soon (can show proof) we get foodstamps but we're out of food and won't get foodstamps till the 10th . any help would be greatly appreciated , thank you ! i won't be able to check my messages again until about 3pm so i might not respond withing minutes , thanks
0	I heard ya'll give out pizzas. Can I have one please? I really don't have a story. The honest truth is that it's 85 degrees here and I just don't feel like making the house any hotter by cooking. I've got all my fans going and it's still pretty warm in here. Can you help me out with some dinner please?
0	We decided to marathon this game a la middle school binge playing before he gets deployed to the Navy in 2 days. Help us out and feed us while we play through this (so far magnificent) game! :)
0	So me and my bro are wanting to live up the last day in town before we separate for college. Unfortunately, because of this we are all broke. All of our refrigerators have been cleaned out and we are desperate for food. It would be REALLY awesome if our last meal together was payed by the Interwebs and we will forever grateful. Thank You.
0	Hey guys, long story short, myself, husband and son ran out of food stamps last week and all we've had in the house is rice, bread, peanut butter, a bit of ground beef, cheese, and some condiments. We will receive more stamps in the morning (5/17). Us adults are definitely feeling the appetite fatigue.  Myself, I'm starting a diet/fitness program tomorrow, so tonight is my last night to cheat, and I have a craving for Papa Johns spinach chicken Alfredo pizza  Anyone want to treat us to a pie or two?
0	So, my roommate and I both have a whole pile of work to conquer tonight...I myself have about 100 pages of reading as well as a 6 page essay to write, all due before noon tomorrow. My roommate, who is an Occupational Therapy Major and I don't envy in the slightest, has a whole barrel of memorization and classification notes to work with. We're both going to be up all night and neither of our pay checks come in until tomorrow.  If a good Samaritan provided us with a delicious pie, we'd be forever grateful! Our location is in Ithaca, NY.  
0	found this site through a friends post on fb, got hungry and fascinated *being totaly broke* decided to eat microwaved taquito's untill i burst.  having failed that, was encouraged to post this request in IRC. &lt;3 to all!
1	Me and my brother have been sick, and my mother took the week off of work to take care of us, and my father has been working more to compensate.   Everyone's pretty grumpy, so I figured a pizza would be nice!  EDIT: THANKS TO BRIGUY9876 FOR THE PIZZA!
0	 If there is anyone out there that can sympathize with that. I am a college student. Broke as a joke. Let me know. I am in Michigan
1	Hello amazing do-gooders of Reddit!  I'm 26, and graduating with my B.S. in 31 days. I busted my ass off to get a special grant from the state this year so that I could afford to finish my final year of my undergraduate degree. Each semester this is $2500, and really it just helps me pay rent and utilities. (My mom passed away a year ago, and my father is currently squatting in house in the Appalachians somewhere. I literally have nowhere to go if I can't afford a place to live.)  Well, I am still waiting on the grant money for this semester. My case worker contacted me 10 days ago saying she had just caught something she missed, and I should expect the school to receive payment in "a few weeks"... And I'm still waiting.  Thankfully I just got a part time job working 12-10 sat &amp; sun. But my first paycheck is largely going to pay my recently increased Comcast bill and my cellphone, which I haven't had on since March 22. My birthday was on March 27, and I didn't get a single present or phone call because I can't pay my phone bill. I am behind on my rent. I've been surviving off of 1-2 packets of ramen a day for the past 3 weeks.   I could really just use a hug... or an internet hug in the form of a pizza...  And fully plan on pizza-ing someone the second I can afford to. 
0	Hello there. I'm not thrilled about asking, but myself, my roommate, and my girlfriend are quite hungry. The three of us have a class through dinner on Tuesdays/Thursdays, and this week, there's just nothing left in our fridge to cook, and none of us gets paid until tomorrow.  If any redditors are around and would like to donate a pizza to our cause, we'd be very thankful! 
1	At this point austerity measures have been enacted weeks ago. I've been learning to cook cheap plentiful stables, like rice, rice, and also rice. Loan disbursement was supposed to kick off yesterday but after consulting with my massively inept financial aid office it seems that my loan has been lost in the aether. I'm a little dizzy and a lot pissed off and a hot delicious pizza would do wonders for my mood.  Would anyone kindly help me out?
0	Hi I am in louisville ky and I am asking for help with a pizza and cheesesticks until tomorrow when I get paid..We are down to nothing in our house right now and we are hungry..Could anyone please help us out please..
0	Pretty much she left me home to go to a houseparty! Ive just started breaking bad so would love to eat pizza along with this... thankyou!  ( Also in the UK if that helps? )
0	So, last summer I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease.  It's an autoimmune disorder where the body freaks out over gluten, a protein in wheat, barley and rye (And most processed foods, due to cross-contamination in factories).  Since then, I haven't been able to eat most breads, nor gluten-free foods processed in facilities where they might have gotten contaminated by something that contains gluten.  Obviously, this means pizza's out.  When I first was diagnosed, I tried to eat gluten-free pizzas - they were all absolutely terrible, and I just gave up.  I'm appealing to you guys, now.  **Pizza used to be my favorite food, and now I can't eat it.**  I live in Brooklyn, NY.  If anyone knows of a place in the borough that does decent, gluten-free pizza **that is also prepared in a celiac-friendly kitchen** (this is very important, just being made with gluten-free ingredients isn't enough), please let me know.  You don't even need to buy me any, just tell me that it exists and I'll go there myself first thing tomorrow.  Thanks for your time, redditors.  Have a slice and think of me!
0	I am here asking for a Pizza dinner for my family,My son has been asking for Pizza which has now made everyone want Pizza but its not something we can afford at this time.After bills there isn't a lot of money left for food,We receive  food stamps but you can't buy real pizza on food stamps. We haven't had real pizza for a place like papa johns,dominos, ect for I am not sure how long because I can't remember the last time normally we have to stick with frozen pizza from the grocery store.I am not sure if this request will get granted but I wanted to let everyone know how wonderful this site is I was told about this site by my mother who was told by one of our neighbors.   There are five of us living here: Myself,My boyfriend,My mother,&amp; my two teenagers,Normally three pizzas is enough for everyone to get 2/3 slices each,Extras aren't even necessary just pizza would make us more than happy. I was provided a  verification code &amp; can give that to anyone who is needing it. I can also provide a photo of my mother holding up a sign  with todays date [I just got home from a long days work &amp; look horrible so I am too embarrassed to take a photo] at this  time my boyfriend is still at work &amp; my kids will be home in about an hour - two hours. Thank you for taking the time to  read this it isn't a life threatening need we would just really like to have some fresh just baked mouth watering pizza &amp; can provide pictures of the Pizza afterward.
0	Would very much appreciate a Pizza for Dexter night tonight! My friends and I usually have munchies, this time we are watching it at my house. Because I am trying to lose weight (20 pounds down!) I spent all of my food-money on healthy shit nobody will want. I would be more than happy to return the favour tomorrow or Tuesday.  Thanks for reading! On a side note: who's excited for Dexter?!
0	Girlfriend is HUNGRY.  Won't be paid for a while so have been eating fucking poppyseed crackers to stave off hunger today.  I know this is America centric so it's a long shot.  EDIT: Worth noting that when i do acquire funds this week I will pay it forward to another UK resident
0	Going to the University of Oregon in Eugene and would appreciate some meaty, cheesy, gooey goodness to help me hit the books. Please PM me for the verification code. Thank you.
0	No sob story just hungry and bored.
0	Bank account at -36. Still looking for a job. Haven't eaten since Saturday morning and no gas to get to foodbank. We get a little bit of money on Wednesday for gas and milk for one-year old son.  Pizza or job in Dallas area would be very appreciated.
0	I have been low on cash for the past month, and with that i've also been hungry having to pay rent insurance electricity and all of my bills I have no room for enjoying a hot meal, so if any one with a kind heart can help me out, I can do the same as soon as i'm back on my feet 
0	I snowboarded all day, and made dinner at like 5 cuz i was starving. No more pasta left and don't want to drive to grocery store since i'm drinking. And now i'm really hungry again... If it is in my fate to get a pizza tonight, I will be very happy and grateful, and pizza it forward :] 
1	Today is my birthday, and I'm hungry. I'm a non-trad college student and a single mom. My daughter is at her dad's at the moment.  I'm flat broke. I spent the very last of my money on food, but ramen and fish sticks aren't sounding very appetizing at the moment. I have a code for 20% off at Papa Johns, btw. [Birthday proof](http://imgur.com/RZr9T.jpg)
0	Today, has been a shitty day, starting out with me falling asleep during an exam and not even answering 25-30 of the 96 questions after studying for most of the night, becoming ill shortly afterwards and missing my crew practice today due to the fact I missed the shuttle between campuses at 12:00 and missed the carpool for my crew team. On said shuttle I took at 1:00, I left my iPod. Here I sit hoping someone will contact me saying they have it. So ROAP'ers can y'all please brighten my day with a pizza?
0	Was wondering if someone could spread some randomness around?   I'm quite hungry and i haven't got a thing to fix to eat and was wondering if i could see about getting a pizza  *edit spellings 
0	As we all well know, borderlands 2 just came out, and the sneaky little bastard ate my money. I'd really appreciate a random act of pizza! I'd happily return the favor in October!
1	Hi, folks. My friend and I are starving because our cafeteria isn't open this late and we have no money to buy food off campus. Tell me if I'm doing this incorrectly. :D
0	I have only had Pizza Hut and other cookie cutter style.   Tim
0	So sure to a screw up by my company HR department I came home from vacation and realized my vacation pay had been mis applied and I will not be getting it on this check but the next. That was 13 days ago and me and my roommateare broke and hungry. I live in central Texas. 
1	I've been unemployed for a while now, and while I've been job-searching, my roommates have been awesome. They've yet to charge me rent, and have given me food, beer, and most importantly, support.  I really love these guys and I'd like to do something nice for them. I usually keep the house pretty clean, doing dishes, taking out the trash, and anything else my broke ass can do to show appreciation.  I know it's a long shot, but I thought I'd try RAoP. It would be really awesome if they could come home from work to a couple of pizzas. I don't know if it's in bad taste to ask for more than one, but we're three guys and one would just not be enough.  Thanks,  Robotbeard
0	I recently moved from California to Lynchburg, Virginia... A very big change of pace. And didn't realize that city life is so much easier. I have a bad knee from a previous injury and didn't know everything would be soooo far apart. Now I need to save for a car.. with no income. So everything I have with me, has to go to hopefully finding a cheap vehicle.  A pizza would be very nice right now. My luck has not been so great. 
0	I got laid off on Monday from my blue-collar job I've had for years. My boss said that it's hopefully a temporary cost-cutting measure,  and I'll probably be hired back in the fall when production picks up, and I believe him. Things always pick back up in the fall.   I have a little bit of money saved up, but I stress about the long term.   For the last year, it's just been me and my 2 wonderful girls, A. (6) and P.(9).  Their mom left last year due to with her drug abuse (First perscription opiates, then heroin). After 3 rounds of 28-day  treatment (one of them court-ordered), I kicked her out... I had to, I couldn't bear to have the girls see her in the state she was in 99% of the time; if not high, then dope-sick and angry. She occasionally will pop up and visit, but I know she's still using.  Long story short: My kids aren't exactly starving, but they havent had a pizza night with dad in quite a long time. I'm hoping we can sit on the floor as a family in front of the tv, put in "How to Train Your Dragon", chow down, and forget about stuff for a couple of hours.   P.S. Obvious throwaway, I didn't want to post with my regular account, as I'm a regular poster/commenter, and not a lurker.
0	Having a throwback LAN party with couter-strike, diablo, warcraft ect. Running low on chips and hoping for something with more substance to fuel us the rest of the night. Location, NY USA Thanks for the help!
0	I don't like asking for things (hence me using a side account), but my mom and I could really use some food. I haven't been able to find a job, and she works ultra hard, but w/o child support we can't even pay rent. I think the only thing we have to eat is some canned pineapples. If you want proof I'm an active redditor and not just a beggar, I'll send a screen shot of me logged into my real account or w/e. I just don't want my friends to know about my situation. Thank you for this wonderful website! (sorry I don't have any cats.) 
0	I just recently took a job opportunity, and finished out my two weeks at my previous employers. The overlap in training has left me with no money for my bills, my brother's wedding, or food. I'm kind of struggling and just seeing if anyone would like to lend a hand. I have lurked here for a while and will certainly pay the favor forward as soon as I get on my feet at the new job. Atlanta, GA,USA here
0	So we are sitting here starving and then it comes to us! Random Acts of Pizza! so we figured wed give it a try. Now we dont have much to offer cept the fact that we could pay it forward (eventually) AND we could write you (our savior who decideds to help) a custom song bro! to show all your friends haha. Why the hell not eh?
1	I'm re-posting, as my post of three days ago wasn't replied to.  Following a longgg period of underemployment, I found full-time work at this call centre; pay's great, benefits are great, but they're holding my wages a MONTH (as they do all new hires), and I'm utterly broke.  A hot meal would be so, so nice today.  I've asked and received here once before, 1 - 2 months ago. Hoping to be in the spot to pay this forward soon. Thanks a lot, RAoP! 
1	Sup RAOPists,   So I'm in Bellingham hanging out with MY GIRLFRIEND and was curious if this RAOP thing worked. We just finished a 6 mile hike and don't have much money to spare. We decided if we could convince any kind soul to donate a pizza to us, that would be flippin sweet, and we'll pay it forward later in the future when we have more $$$. Anyone?  EDIT: pizza order has been placed by a person who prefers to remain anonymous. Thank you muchlies, good sir or madam!  EDIT 2: And now with a picture! http://i.imgur.com/G9Rog.jpg We got a large pizza with half Hawaiian and half cheese, cuz Heather is a lame vegetarian who also dislikes pineapple.  Peace love and hugs, -Scott and Heather
0	The title says it all I am about to turn 18. When I do that means cutting a lot of expensive things for a while. So all I request from this beautiful subreddit is to let me have a swell time eating pizza :) [7].
0	I have a buddy in Idaho that's fallen on hard times and is basically doing low level MMA fights to make ends meet. That being said, I'd like to hook him up with some pizza, but Domino's/Pizza Hut and Papa John's doesn't accept Canadian Credit Cards, anyone willing to help him out?   Full disclosure, he's a DotA buddy, so I don't know him personally but I do know that his life is kinda shit.
1	I have never really been one to ask for help, but my kids over rule my pride any day. I am the proud mother of four beautiful children: Aiden: 2 Cameron: 3 Olivia: 5 Joshua; 8 Recently we've had some bad times, my husband of 10 years kicked me and my children out after meeting a girl online, I have no family here and I don't really know anyone but the people I go to church with. My father is helping me out all he can he's paying for my room. I haven't had a job in 8 year but now I'm looking but there are very few jobs and I have to work around the churches day-care program I am food stamps Wednesday and the motel offers a free breakfast, but my children really deserve a pizza I mean their lives are completely changed and while their friends are going to see Harry Potter(mostly Josh) I can't afford anything like that's and I am Hoping maybe I can get some pizza to boost morale.  
0	Hey guys, I'm just looking for any one to help me make it to next week. I don't get paid until Wednesday, but due to a parking ticket ($50! unbelievable) i've been wiped clean of cash. I haven't eaten since Thursday, and while I have no problem with just sucking it up until Wednesday, I have a test Monday and a random act of pizza would really help to get my brain going.   Thanks for even looking at this!
0	Money will be coming in Saturday from an old pair of speakers I'm selling, until then its pasta for me. Would really appreciate a pizza to help me through this week as I've got so much work and I'm exhausted from my public services fitness training. I finally got my financial support from college verified but that only means free lunch at college which I couldn't get until tomorrow. I'm finally getting an interview on Friday for a job which is really good as I've been unemployed so long and maybe this is the crutch I need to get through these financial issues I've been having for so long. Who knows, maybe one day I'll be gifting the pizza! But until then, I'm stuck. Would try and repay the favour if I could in some way.
0	I'm staying up all night to get a headway on an assignment about soil (duller than dull) which will be one of the last papers I write before I graduate this May with (hopefully) a sparkly lovely degree. Naturally my body has decided I need to suffer and has bestowed me with the finest  mind-numbing-no-breathing-allowed-just-give-up-already head cold it could muster. I refuse to give in! Pizza will be my salvation. 
1	I've been wanting a pizza for a while but all my money has been going into gas to get to and from school. I only have 6 dollars in my wallet and would greatly appreciate a pizza. I'm in mississippi if it matters.
1	Hey guys, I'm curled up in my dorm studying for finals. It's also freezing cold because my roommate can't fall asleep unless it's freezing. He finished his exams though and gets to sleep in, I'm sure he has a massive hangover.   As any college student, money is tight, and it's hard to actually have a heart warming meal. I usually just rely on hot dogs without buns and ramen.   Of course there are people that are more than me, and please, help them first. I'm not going to die, nor do I have 5 kids, just a college student. Thank you for taking the time to read this and enjoy your weekend!
0	We're pretty freaking hungry. We get paid Friday but until then we have nothing. I knit like a madwoman and I will gladly send a knit good of your choice in return for a delicious pizza.
0	Fiance took the car seat base, so we have no way of leaving our apartment today. Since we're stuck, it'd be nice to get a decent lunch delivered. Thanks for considering us!
0	This week has been hectic and very trying. I realize I'm new but I've actually been here a while. Anyway My sister and her children will be here to stay with us in about 2 hours. She is coming from a long way and is leaving a domestic violence situation. She wasn't supposed to be here until the weekend but is coming in today. If she had come saturday like she was supposed to I would have had more time but now I have nothing to feed them and they have been driving 25 hours. I can pay it forward but not til monday or tuesday. I already fed mine so were good but help to feed them would be very much appreciated. If you can help please let me know and ask what you need. Thank you
0	I've has been going through a bit of a rough patch financially and my cupboards looking pretty empty. Used all of of my savings to pay for my school for next semester. Thankfully, I'm going to be starting a new job tomorrow, but it'll be a while until my first check comes around. I think a pizza would really make things look a little brighter around here and be an awesome change from my oatmeal diet! I'll definitely try to return the favor come paycheck time.
1	I'll pay it forward when I have money
0	I promise to repay the favor in the near future.  
0	Alright, I returned home yesterday -- after spending the previous few days with my boyfriend -- to discover my apartment had been... burglarized (not robbed but burglarized -- police helpfully explained distinction) of the following junk:  - PS3 - PS2 - assortment of games for both - coffee table - my crappy CRT TV  *Thankfully* I'd taken my laptop over to boyfriend's for some LAN partying.  I've never posted to RAoP before, and my account's (very) new, so I apologize for my lack of street cred -- though I've been lurking for months and months. =D  Anyway, reddit, a pizza for me would be like the Holy Grail at this point. I don't... exactly know how this works, but if anyone's willing to help and/or wants any further info, I'll happily happily oblige. Thank you! &lt;3
0	My husband and I each work 2 jobs so we do not have to live off of the state.  We have an infant (born April 21st) and we are happy parents, but money is tighter than ever. We haven't been able to afford to go on a "date" since before the baby was born.  Will someone help us have a nice date night in? We are in the New London, CT area
0	My alarm did not go off before work this afternoon, so I did not have any time to grab a bite to eat before work, and I'm here until midnight. I don't get paid again until Thursday, though, and I just had all my bills due. Pizza would be awesome, will pass it on come Thursday.
0	We all know that period between student loans when you're stretching every penny you have. Unfortunately for me my housemates decided to shaft me by all buying stuff just before bills, meaning i was the only one with the money to pay them this month. This has left me with just enough to cover rent until the loan comes in later this month, but until then, and until I can get the money back from housemates, I'm a little on the food-light side of life.  Any pizza would be much appreciated &lt;3
0	Hey fellow pizza-lovers.   It is coming to the end of the semester and I am about at my breaking point. Me and my roommate are bio majors (senior year) and we are currently taking microbiology. FUCKING. HELL. I don't want to go on too much of a rant here, but essentially, our professor is not a very nice person. When hurricane Sandy came rolling through, given that we had missed at least a week and a half of school, most professors took this into consideration and removed certain assignments that were due considering time constraints. NOT THIS BITCH. In fact, she added onto the syllabus. In the end, we had a little more than 400 pts due in the last week of class in an 800pt course. I have never been so stressed in my entire college career and I think my roommate is about to lose it.   Our freezer is empty. We run to the caf when we can (considering its not closed because our school sucks sometimes), but it has been the same food since the beginning of the semester, and quite frankly, makes me piss out of my asshole. With our final in the class coming up this Tuesday, it would really be an unbelievably generous treat to have some pizza to help us study for this test.  tl;dr Poor, frustrated bio majors looking for some brain food.
0	Today, I'm with my 10 year old sister. I spent the day with her yesterday, and I'm going to spend today with her again. I plan on going to the beach with her later. Now, I *do* have money, but sadly, all I have is a $20 from my mom which I think I might need to spend on gas because the tank is almost empty, and my own money, which came from my last paycheck a few weeks ago, and I have been saving. A little help would be appreciated. Now, I would like to give something in return to the sender of the pizza, because I like giving back. So in return, I will draw you whatever you want (mind you, I'm not that talented). Thanks so much!
0	I don't have diablo 3 yet but when it finally gets delivered i will give you the guest code, if for some reason it doesn't have a guest code i will give you something else.
0	That's right folks, I'll do mostly anything silly for a taste of the greasy goodness. Parents are out of town and I'm flat broke, so I thought I'd try and give laughs in return for pizza.   Fairbanks, Alaska area. Papa Johns, Dominos, or Pizza Hut would be most appreciated.
0	We're not picky, as long as there's not fish on it.  I can eat like a tank, BUT I can curb my appetite - I don't want to make you go broke on a request :D.
1	My suit's pressed, I've spent the last two days researching and memorizing everything I can about the place, I even googled tips for acing an interview. I'm really pumped and I think I'm ready to nail this... the only problem is that I haven't eaten in three days, and I haven't had a good meal for longer than that. My arms are shaking, I can hardly walk without my heart beating furiously, and I just noticed that my voice shakes as well. If I show up to an interview like this I' afraid they'll think I'm a crackhead (I'm pretty skinny). The last substantial thing I ate was a sample of a sandwich from Jimmy Johns, (I asked for three and gave the other two to the homeless people I'd passed a block before) that was on Wednesday.  I just need some sustenance, whether it be a pizza, sammich... shoo I'd be excited about a bag of breadsticks.  If anyone is gracious enough to help me out, I promise to return the favor and help people out on RAOP as soon as financially possible.  Thanks for your time!
0	I am a longtime lurker and have made people into redditors I plan on keeping this account as the name is exactly how I've feelt the past 4 years  I have just finished an exam(A level's) and have spent all my money on a travelcard for the week (more exams on tuesday and thursday). I live alone and do not get any money until friday(part time bar work). All i have left to eat is 2 cans of tuna, I would be willing to sell my soul(I dont have anything else to sell) for food. I would be willing to send proof (contract for soul,internet bank statement,two cans of tuna) Somebody please help me. I know its random acts of pizza but i wouldn't mind even if it was 4 grocery items (cheaper than a pizza in total)(2 more cans of tuna and sweetcorn and mayo)  [edit] made redditors -&gt;made people into redditors  [edit2] would not care if food is not pizza
0	My wife dog and I are stuck in a hotel in Pensacola, FL. We have been here all weekend and just are tired and hungry.   We've done a lot of driving and just hoping that someone would be nice enough to send a pizza our way. I'll pay it forward Friday. My wife has sent several pizzas here before per her username. 
0	No sad story, i'm just a really hungry (and broke) student working on an essay that's due tomorrow. Wrote 1500 words yesterday thinking I could write another 2000 easily...I was wrong aha.   It's shitty cause if i'm this broke now, I'm going to be even more broke next year with tuition hikes. 
0	Broke college student studying for finals and I have no money to get something to eat. If there is anyone out there that would like to help a poor kid out, it would be much appreciated =D
0	My first time posting here. I'm craving a pizza but can't afford to spend because I have to do shopping for the family tomorrow. If you'd be generous I'd be soooo grateful !!
0	So we're having a house show. And pizza boxes make our lineup. So what better to have pizza at our pizza party house show. This one is 12 bands. Help feed hungry musicians and a house full of people with a pizza!
1	Hi guys, if you've clicked in this post and you're reading this, then thank you for at least considering my plight.  I'm just looking for a morsel to eat is all. I didn't eat all day today (United Kingdom, Tuesday), and I won't eat all day tomorrow (Wednesday) until I get my housing benefit on Thursday, which is meant to pay my rent but doesn't even cover that and I will now have to do food shopping with.  I have 7 pence in my bank account currently I believe. I would really, *really* appreciate it if some one could make it so I didn't have to go two days plain hungry.  Thanks for your reading, and thanks for your time and consideration. I only ever wanted to get by. Let me know if you're interested in helping.   Thanks.
0	My unemployment benefits have been exhausted and my interview for food stamps isn't until Tuesday. The only food I have at home is bread and peanut butter that I've been eating all week..I would love a pizza.. I will provide anyone willing with verification of who I am and even screenshots and pictures. I would greatly appreciate any help and thank you in advance! 
0	But I was pleasantly surprised to click on it, only to find such a cool subreddit! I looked through the posts- there are a lot of sad stories, and a lot of pizzas mending some rough situations. While I don't have any such problems in my life, I do love both pizza and kindness, and I would be *elated* to be on the receiving side of such a great combo!  Combo makes me think of pizza. Mmmmmm.  I live in Chicago, IL, right next to Clark and Division, visiting my girlfriend (my home is in the Bay Area of California). I don't do evil things, try my best to smile every day, love black olives, and want to give a warm thank you to everyone who reads this!
0	Pizza is soft enough I can eat it without it hurting too much.  So I went to the dentist, she said  "we're only going to work on one side so you can still chew on the other."  I said "Great, what side?" She said "The top."  à² _à² 
0	Hi stranger, my friends and I are working late in the office tonight. If you send us some pizza you'll make some interns really happy tonight :)  Also, we live in Singapore. :)
0	we are decorating the Christmas tree and I would like to have a few pizzas for the kids this is not a must have but I know it would be something they would enjoy. we have papa johns pizza inn and dominoes that deliver to our home anyone that may help we will be so very thankful!
1	Woke up with a massive headache and sore throat, so ended up missing work. Tried to play some games to relax, but had constant losses(why do I play competitive games to relax? lol). Pretty much out of food and don't get paid until tomorrow, so food would be appreciated. :D  Now, don't take me as desperate. Worst case scenario I'm hungry for one night and have plenty of food tomorrow. Still, I'd appreciate a pizza!  Edit: Near Boston, Massachusetts.  
0	Her husband is in the Navy and didn't get paid before he had to leave for a 1 month trip and she has no food in her apartment, what-so-ever.  I'd do it myself but I don't get paid until next week.  I'm hoping some kind soul could help her out.
0	And I'd really like a pizza -- something of real sustenance to put into my belly before my first day of work on Monday would be nice.   Planning a wedding? I worked in a copy center for several years and would love to give advice for printing and pricing.  Like music? I DJ and would love to create a mix of your favorite EDM genre in your honor :3!!!!!!  Thanks in advance my pizza heroes =^-^=!
0	I sprained my ankle (I have repeated problems with this ankle from a previous injury) and then I had to work at a cafe all day because it was my first day and I've been unemployed for a month so I can't afford to lose this new job that I finally found (I've been cleaning houses sporadically since I moved back to the city, and just scraping by). On top of that I passed my first kidney stone recently and I'm having landlord issues. I'm trying to stay optimistic but I just feel like I can't get a break lately.
0	First time posting here.  My husband and I work a very tough schedule so that we can keep our kids out of daycare (cant afford it anyhow.).  We do not even own a car, so we often get about 30 minutes TOPS to see each other between shifts.  It'd be nice to fill th e void with a pizza.  I do have an account with PapaJohns, and they are the closest to me.  Here we have a "local deal" (Cowboys Special) where for $14 and change (with delivery charge) I can get a large pizza and a 2 liter for us.  
0	I've never done this before, but between today, registering for classes for my return to school for the first time in 3 years...it's been an extremely long day. I'd love to swing by Pizza Hut on the way home.  Thanks, guys.  **Edit:** Oops. North Carolina, USA here!  **Edit 2:** Well it's quitting time, so I'll revoke my pizza request until another time.
0	We are a disabled couple with 1 daughter. No money until Sept 3, broke and no food.
0	I just graduated and moved into a new place in southern Ontario (think London, St. Mary's and surrounding area).  I'm functionally broke for 4 weeks, and would love a pizza, since they keep well in the fridge and can stretch over a couple days.    I have some games on Steam that I'm able to gift: Half Life 2 Half Life 2: Episode One Kings Bounty: The Legend Puzzle Agent  I've also got some TF2 items (nothing great, I don't really play it) http://i.imgur.com/amW9K.png  If none of that interests you, I can also some man hours if you need a C++, C#, or Java developer for a tiny project.  I hope there's someone out there who would be interested! 
1	Hi. My girlfriend told me about Reddit and random acts of pizza. I still can't believe there is people this generous out there. I need a hand with the food for my daughter's birthday party. I am a single mom of 3 kids, ages 6 months, 3 years, and 7 years. I am throwing a small party this Saturday, Oct 29th and my daughter requested pizza for supper and I'm not sure I can afford pizza for all her guests (10 girls) I would appreciate any help offered! Verification can be provided.
0	Hey guys. Just got a new job recently and I'm waiting for my first full pay. My partial pay last week went to rent and I'm a week till I have my first no-strings attached pay. I plan on paying it forward at that point - any chance someone can help me out with a bit of food before then?
1	We are visiting our uncle at the hospital (ORANGE COAST MEMORIAL MEDICAL CENTER in Fountain Valley, California). My cousins are 7 and 12 and I am a 21 year old broke college student. We are starving and have been waiting for hours. Would love some pizza. 
0	I just finalized my enlistment in the US Air Force, and I'd love to celebrate with my fiancee/soon-to-be-wife. Alas, my bank account is running on fumes. Would anyone care to help us out tonight?  I'm in eastern Los Angeles County; I have Pizza Hut, Dominos, and Papa Johns near me. I have a verification code, too!
1	Hey all. Redditor [erenion](http://www.reddit.com/user/erenion), [wedgepiett](http://www.reddit.com/user/wedgepiett), and I are developing a follow up to our [Android app](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.boycottsopa.android) that allows users scan item bar codes and see if they're made by a company that supports SOPA. Our follow up app will allow users to join campaigns and will inform them when they scan an item if it offends any of their campaigns (eg child labor, SOPA, etc). We're in the planning stages now, and are just starting implementation now...and well...we're hungry. We're looking at a few long nights of coding, and pizza helps a ton.

0	My boyfriend's hours got cut So we can't afford to do anything for my birthday
0	I don't ask for any pizza I only ask for your vote in a local pizza poll.  My girlfriend is an Italian immigrant and thus her dad is also Italian. Her dad is the owner and founder of Ciro's New York Pizza in Centerville Virginia. I find the man honorable and look up to him and want to do something for him as a small thank you for his daughter being in my life.  Please if you have a minute of spare time, vote for Ciro's pizza [here](http://www.northernvirginiamag.com/pizza/). Help an immigrant build the American dream.  (if this post is too much a violation of the rules, I understand)
0	Just dropped $400 on textbooks, $202 on a parking pass, $350 for my half of the rent, and have a $95 electric bill to pay next week, and now my ex who just dumped me a month ago is bugging me about trying to get back together. Nothing would brighten up my day than a slice of pepperoni.
0	Hi, I'm an art teacher in central Arkansas that would love some food!  Unfortunately a recent move has put me a little down on my cash this month but am happy to return the favor as soon as my next check comes in! :)  Thanks!
0	Work wouldn't give me the day off so my band could play a show so I called out day of and was fired. Not the smartest decision but a pizza would make me feel much better about it

1	So here's the breakdown, my friend and I attend this university in OH, we've been long time lurkers of RAoP and have talked about doing it once we have some money. As it stands now I have about $2.66 in my account and my roommate has $0.00 due to Jimmy Johns screwing him over with a pending transaction that he cancelled but it still displays as pending. As we do attend a small university there are only two places that deliver here, Donatos and Golden Crust (A local place). If someone does fulfill this request I can guarantee both of us will repay RAoP in the near future (We get our Fin Aid refund checks on Tuesday).  If anyone wants any more info just shoot me a message!  Thanks,  Lakerz4life

0	We have been playing for 3 days and cannot make it to our cafeteria for fear of being turned into Zombies. We are desperately hungry!  Humas Vs. Zombies is a game that takes part around an entire college campus. Where humans are given weapons (we have socks) and are able to "stun" zombies by hitting them with our socks. Our goal is to live for as long as possible. The zombies can only use their hands to "turn" humans into zombies. The 3 Redditors are the last of 15 Humans.   (Edit) Added some extra info about HvZ
1	So it's that time of the term again when everyone's student loan has run out...except...unlike most students, I can't go home either because I have an 8000 word dissertation to write :â(. Please pitty me and feed me, pleeeaassee? 
0	This is the first time I've requested pizza on RaoP and I have seen that you guys don't love sob stories all the time so I'm going to keep it brief.  Girlfriend has given me chickenpox, I'm a student so have no money and I live in North Wales. And no I didn't have a problem with the flooding but I can't go home if I wanted to because the main route to home is still flooded.  I would love some pizza, and it would really brighten up my day.
0	Out of work pretty recently and cannot seem to find a new job. Putting up my resume to a couple more locations right after this post. Live in NC. Can anyone help a broke struggling redditor out?

1	My boyfriend and I were living in Chicago while I was attending school, I have just graduated and will be moving to a more affordable residence on Thursday but until then all of our money is currently tied up in application fees, deposits and rent. Anything would make this rather bleak night infinitely better and will be payed forward as soon as we are able.

0	My girlfriend and I moved out to Longmont, Colorado just under a month ago primarily for school and while my work transfered me (Starbucks), the lack of hours while moving in combination with other factors has left us with nothing but cornbread until Monday. My girlfriend has gone to the coffee shop to apply for scholarships in peace and I would love to be able to fill her tummy with surprise pizza upon her return. I promise to pay it forward.
0	I don't know much about random acts of pizza, so I'm not sure if it is okay to request pizza on behalf of a random redditor I don't know.  I'm really sorry if I'm doing it wrong, but I saw his comic and remembered you: http://i.imgur.com/DZb4a.png  (Let me know if I shouldn't have this up here, and I'll delete it.) Edit: Oops.  That should be r/atheism in the title. I'm posting before 6 AM and not my sharpest.
1	Today is the first day of summer for my kids. Im recently unemployed so I dont have any extra cash for a fun meal right now. I would love to surprise them with some pizza for lunch or dinner. They are expecting Pb&amp;j and would be thrilled to have pizza instead. Thanks for reading!
1	Hi, I am requesting some help. I will not starve or anything, but I am getting by on cereal and enough bread for maybe two more sandwiches until unemployment comes through (hopefully) early in the week. I will pay it forward as soon as I get my unemployment.  Thank you so much. Even if you do not choose me thank you just for caring. -Jack
0	Just a college student looking for a little cheesy goodness to survive the hell that is Finals Week. 
0	My very first post on Reddit was to give a pizza! Now I'm in an apartment with friends with nearly two feet of snow outside, and we'd love to share a big pepperoni. Unfortunately we don't have any big chains nearby, just local pizzerias, but I'm happy to verify, share silly photos, whatever you'd like.
0	I am currently at work, surrounded by people who make more than I do for doing less work.  My job stresses me out so much and 95% of my money goes towards bills/paying for daycare for my baby girl.  To top it off, my work just switched to bi-weekly pay and I literally have $12.32 in my checking account to last me until Friday.  Due to lack of finances, my boyfriend and I have not been out to eat/gotten take out in almost a year and would love a meal that I don't have to cook.  I'll pay it forward as soon as I have a little extra cash... promise!
0	Unemployed, poor, etc.  More importantly, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY!! Help me celebrate with a birthday pie?
0	Been out of work for two weeks, but my new job in NYC starts on Monday.  It'll be another two weeks before my first paycheck and it's getting scary putting everything on the credit card.  Pizza sounds awesome on a Saturday... while I sit at home and catch up on some new episodes of adventure time...  Edit: despite our best efforts on an international pizza order, pizza did not come through.  But I want to thank /u/powdered_water for trying so hard, anyway! I'm gonna cook some rice and veggies, tonight, but if somebody wants to buy me a pizza for tomorrow, I'll happily accept! :D
0	Pregnant and craving pizza!! Will pay it forward on payday! :)

Had a great friend drop me off at home, but have and empty fridge, and can't really travel anywhere due to drugs still affecting me.  Randomly remembered this subreddit in a post surgery haze, and thought I'd plead to the reddit Gods.   Will answer any, and all questions if there is any doubt.   Sorry if this is the wrong format for this subreddit as well. I'm doing my best here!   Thanks everyone.

0	Tried getting help but to no avail. Trying to figure things out for the long haul but until that happens we are still hungry tonight. Any help would be much appreciated. If you would like a drawing, or picture or something, please ask. I'm not much of an artist but I want to give back somehow.
0	GOOD MORNING! I'm bloody starving and don't have anything to eat. A delicious pizza would kick my day off to the best start! In return I will spread your legend far and wide. 
0	I'll write it about whatever you like. I'm a songwriter so you're getting a real, quality song. For the sake of time, I'll write it on an acoustic guitar and record a video. If you want better quality after that; I can record it for you.  I woke up dying for a pizza but it's one of those "broke 'til payday" weeks. It'll be much appreciated!
1	I am super hungry and a pizza of any kind would feed me for days. When I get paid Friday I would love to return the favor. Please help a sister out!
0	I posted yesterday but had no luck, sorry for the repost.   I recently moved closer to work, and lost my job, so now I have to try and pay bills instead of buying furniture, so I live in an empty apartment and could just really use a pizza. I know my account is new, i was directed here by a friend. I live in Oak Ridge TN. Thank you.
0	So, I am having surgery Monday to hopefully end years of a painful rare kidney disease. I am sitting at home today realizing that today is really the last day I could really enjoy a great meal but I am broke....   I keep thinking about a week or more worth of hospital food, ok the jello will rock, and I am jonesing now for a pizza!   I will be more than willing to pay it forward once recovered!
0	I turn 20 tommorrow and I don't think I'll work this week because I have to code documents (think identifying docs using a program). Well we don't have enough documents to do (DAMN YOU DIGITAL MEDIA!) so our boss tells my and my coworkers to go home and come back when we get a call. Last time that happened, they called us a week later, so we didn't work a whole week.   Anyways, I love Pizza. It's my favorite food. And I live in Houston.   Thanks!   Edit: I'll give back when I have the money to spend on pizza. 
1	I'm on my own and have no family to speak of, I'm alone in Florida and have $5.48 left to my name for gas to get to and from work. I lost my job due to downsizing but thankfully got a new one soon after - the only problem is they pay you bi weekly. I started on the 9th of this month and don't get my paycheck until this Thursday - the 26th. I only have enough bread left to have one sandwich a day until then. I want nothing more right now than a Domino's Philly Cheese Steak pizza and a 20oz bottle of cherry coke and I swear to celebrate my first paycheck by giving someone else a pizza as soon as I can. Please help me before I start to cry strawberry jelly.
1	I live in Iowa. I have never posted on RAOP but the very idea behind it helps to instill my faith in humanity.
1	I'm a 22 year old guy living in the outskirts of Seattle. I lost my job a couple months ago because of anxiety issues and have been barely making it by. I'm practically down to my last packet of ramen. =(  I have an exciting job opportunity now, and if everything goes well, I should be starting next week! I'll dedicate my first pay-check to you guys and offer someone else in need a free pizza! Please help me out, reddit! =)
0	I can give you drawings, upvote your stuff, write you a poem, idk, whatever. I have precious little laptop energy left before it dies. 
0	Yesterday I was pickpocketed while taking the subway to my job. I don't have any idea how this happened as I tend to watch out for stuff like this, but I am now without any cash and I don't use a banking service. I don't get paid for another week and a half, and I decided to use the $10 I had on my dresser at home to feed my cat for a week hoping I would find a way to get some food money soon.

0	Anyone would be so kind to send me pizza? My lawnchair fell over and it was devastating to me and my family. My mother couldnt cook today because of this. We just sat together today recounting the tragedy that occured upon our lawnchairs. A day like today makes us grateful to be alive.
0	Just moved to Denver, CO about 2 months ago with just the stuff on our backs and now my brother has a decent job but after we paid up our rental situation we are without food or money until tuesday.    A pizza tonight would be amazing, my brother is coming off working a 12 hour shift and would freak out if there was an option of pizza.  Thanks for reading.  EDIT: Update!  We still have no money or food.  Pizza would be amazing still!
0	Last week I deposited my paycheck but for some reason Regions decided to not make the funds available for 3 days, so after using my debit card a few times, I'm now officially -$412 in the hole.  I get paid again tomorrow, and I do have 1 package of ramen left, but I'm 25 weeks pregnant and it's just not going to cut it for the whole day.  So, if anyone is feeling generous I would greatly appreciate a little help! Edit - I realize since I'm using a throwaway this may seem suspicious, but I can provide proof to anyone who wants it.  Empty fridge, ultrasound pic, etc.
0	My apartment building has recently changed from rent based to condo. Sadly, I cant afford to keep the same place I've lived in for years. Which left me to squat for a while until I was kick out yesterday. Bummer :/
0	Im just riding it out until next Friday and I'm tired of eating grapes and popcorn. 
0	Been a particularly long day, been up since 4:30 AM and I am just beat. Really can't afford to spend any extra money right now, but a pizza would be really awesome. I will pay it forward on here when I am able to. Just really can't spend any money right now. In terms of places, I haven't lived in this city to long but I know there is a papa johns.
1	Is anyone willing to help me out while I make an expensive move to a new place? I would pay it forward.  UPDATE: Aaaahhh random pizza tastes great! I got a random sandwich and Coke thrown in. Thanks so much to jonnyamsterdam for the RAOP! I'm saving the leftovers for dinner!
1	Me and my friend are both students located in brighton uk, the bills for the house came through earlier than expected so it was either we found some food for ourselves with what little cash we had, or make sure our cat was still fed please help.  9 week old kitty sleeping after a full meal  http://i.imgur.com/yr95o.jpg
0	It's a slow Sunday afternoon and I'm both bored and hungry so I thought I'd have a go at fixing both of these at once. Think up a challenge which you'd deem worthy of a pizza and I'll give it a go and post pics. If you think I did well enough you can congratulate me with some delicious pizza.
0	I've been working on a Web Publishing final all day, and am finally nearing completion. Though in the process, I forgot to get to the cafe in time to get myself a decent meal. All I've got here is cheese and bread, and while a staple, just isn't enough.  Would anyone care to give a RAOP PapaJohn's e-giftcard? They're the only place around here.  Edit - I suppose I should go ahead and mention I'm in Ohio. :)
0	Title pretty much sums it up. You people here are ridiculously awesome for coming up with such an absurd concept. Bark bark.
0	Id love to give her some relief, but I can't afford it. Message me if you can help. You guys rock..
1	It's my birthday and I'm unemployed, out of cash, pretty hungry. One of my online friends sent me a link to this reddit page and said I should give it a try. I'm not expecting anything, but I'd be grateful if someone would help.
0	I can't draw.. at all but I'd really love a pizza for me and my roommate tonight and I thought I'd try and cheer him up with some since he is pretty down today. I can try and draw you something in MS paint? I don't have kittens or cute cat pictures I can show so sorry to dissapoint :(
0	I moved to the UK from Virginia (DC Suburb) about 2 years ago and I worked at a Franchised owned Subway Restaurant and I was hospitalized while I was there. When I got out of the hospital, I found out that I no longer worked there. that was about 2 months ago. I have been struggling to find a job in the last 2 months and I just paid my rent and now I am now down to my last Â£7:  [Account Info](http://i.imgur.com/wJU3K.png)  Any help to eat something other then cheap tinned food would be greatly appreciated. Thank You.  Also, when I do get a job, I will give out 2 pizzas.
1	Isla Vista, CA. Down to my last few dollars on my last week of school, with nothing but Top Ramen left. I almost think all the sodium is starting to make me tweak. Or maybe it's just all the instant coffee.  EDIT: EvilCactus sent me a gift card early this morning. Thank you to all who offered to help! Reddit's kindness never ceases to amaze me.
1	So here is my family's story: girl meets boy, they fall in love, get married, have teh cutest baby in the world! Somewhere along that path girl starts working for scumbag corporation. When it comes time for maternity leave as the lil' redditor is close to being born, scumbag corporation says 'don't worry, all of your benefits will continue, you'll get paid leave, have fun with teh baby cuddles.'   Well, we really wish it had worked out like that :( I took a full 12 week leave, as available to me thanks to FMLA. 7 Weeks were paid thanks to short term disability, but my company made me wait 3 weeks to get that money, which sucked. My insurance and all of my benefits got cancelled while I was on leave, even though I was assured they'd continue. When I got back to work two weeks ago I fought tooth and nail to get them back, but my benefits department is making me pay out of pocket for the premiums from the time I was on leave and the benefits got cancelled. That adds up to $200 a week... multiplied by 12! They are automatically deducting the payments from my paychecks for the next 4 weeks, after already doing so for my last two checks. They are leaving me with so little in my checks that we've had to dig deeply into our savings just to start paying our bills, and unfortunately we've had to give up grocery shopping until my premiums are caught up and scumbag corporation takes them back over.   Luckily our adorable son gets all he needs from me, so my husband and I are just living off of what's in our pantry, and that has been box after box of pasta. We'd kill for something with flavor at this point, and a pizza sounds like heaven. As soon as we get caught up financially, which according to my strict budget won't be until late November, I plan on doing the same for another redditor in need!   tl,dr; My company is basically making me pay for my maternity leave after the fact, to the sum of $2400. We can't afford groceries because of this right now and would just love one night where we can have the luxury of a pizza. Thanks!
1	I'll keep my sob story short.  I'm not poor, though my current circumstances might lead one to believe that to be the case. I'm in a rut financially, trying to dig myself out with a newly acquired job. This would be the happy ending to my story, if I could see my pay checks. Instead, for the time being, I'll be feeding my checks directly to my landlord.   So I ask Reddit, with a humble heart and an empty stomach to help me out with a delicious pizza pie.
0	Roommates and I had to pay rent on Friday, and I am now broke until I get paid on Wednesday. Totally willing to pay it forward on Wednesday.   Looking for something to add a change to my rice and ramen I've got.
0	So I told my brothers that you can get free pizza through the internet. They dont believe me. On top of this, they said that if I come up with this free pizza they will hook me up with one of their friends. I REALLY need this. 
0	I was going to request a pizza for tonight, I've been in money trouble and waiting on two jobs to call back, but unemployed till then. But I'm a college student and I can still eat reliably so if you looked at this post and considered sending me a pizza, **send it to one of those folks who has people to support!**  **Edit: Okay you guys convinced me, thank you NYGalz! :)**
0	LOCATION: Seattle  (Shoreline)  ((There's a pizza hut very close by))  I started going to school to get my life back on track, but unfortunately my alarm didn't go off a couple times and I lost my job.  Used up my food stamp card and it doesn't refill until the 5th of August.  Only got a couple packets of ramen left.  Normally ramen is fine, but whenever I eat them only I only seem to have a bare minimum of energy, and I have a test tomorrow... I really can't fail this class.  I've ordered pizzas for people and bought people games on Steam before, but no one's ever given me hand.  Got a job interview soon, and every time I get an interview I get the job, so money flow will happen soon and I will pay you back. 
1	I've had a very rough couple of months. Finally got me a another job and my job even loaned me cash to buy another car right after starting after the transmission went out in my other. With getting caught up on bills, paying back the loan as quick as I can, I have been doing pretty good money wise. After almost 1/2 my check goes to child support, my daughters mother called saying they didn't have food. She doesn't work or do anything to get money except live off my child support(shes perfectly fucking healthy by the way...). She is to prideful to get any assistance either. I kept $30 for gas in my bike and car(I don't work far and both get decent mileage) and went to the grocery so my daughter and her brother(8 years old, not mine) have food to eat. I can pay it forward when I get paid and will be glad to!
1	[This is the game - a year old version anyway](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=108111747) Note: I'm in Hungary, pizza place accepts credit/debit cards.
1	i am a single disabled woman who does not have much spending money. i would love a pizza for my 46th birthday! i like supreme or deluxe pizza, but any kind would be a welcome surprise! thank you :)
0	I just moved to a new city in Indiana (Evansville) with my boyfriend. Finally got a job but unfortunately I don't have any extra spending money until after Christmas (I am saving up for a nice present for my boyfriend.) We have milk and some random condiments in our fridge, as well as a lone strawberry poptart in the cupboard. I get payed tomorrow so I can buy a few essentials but tonight we have nothing but a milky poptart. Help?
0	payday is not till next week and ramen noodles only stretch so far with the big littles. nothing fancy cheese if more than enough to please. thank you
0	I don't have a sob story. I have things I could eat. I don't have much extra cash for pizza, and pizza sounds pretty good right now.   If nobody sends me pizza, I'll be just fine.   I'll trade you a cute picture of my cats. And I'll pay it forward when I get paid at the end of the month.  Have a good weekend!
0	So. Was randomly 'asked to resign' or 'get terminated' from my job that I loved as an EMT. I think I'm about to get another job, but, it's been hard because I help provide for my elderly adoptive mother (she's 82). We're getting low on food, and today she just walked by me and said " I wish we had a pizza". I feel terrible because I can't afford such a luxury right now and she doesn't eat enough as it is, but it made me think of you guys over here! I'll provide whatever proof I can if you want it; Thanks guys &lt;3 
0	She doesn't know about reddit, but this girl has gone through a lot this year with her recent ex's new relationship being based around making her upset. She's studying for the same exams I am but won't come out of her room for study breaks and she's starting to become an insomniac. Every time we meet up she looks a little bit more depressed and lonely...  I'm sure some good hearted redditors will be able to scrape together a few dollars for this wonderful girl to show her that there are wonderful people out there (as she doesn't believe me or her friends).
1	Also, as a "victim of the drug war" I may serve time soon. Thanks and best to you and yours. 
1	Biochemistry is a hell of a major. 
1	lately life just seems like there's no hope in sight...at a weird point in life. i left the girl of my dreams because my mom got sick with cancer and had to return to my hometown from living with her in japan. i get home, shit's fucked up, i can't do anything, she breaks up with me. i ended up going back to school to try and get a worthwhile degree (engineering, go figure) and thus spend all my time studying. I also have to work because i come from a fairly poor family and need to pay for an apartment close to campus (not to mention there's no room for me at any of my relative's houses). all my money goes to rent and other monthlys. i don't really have a supportive family, and the friends i thought i had in my city have left because "i'm too much of a downer." really supportive of them huh? now i just have really superficial relationships with the ones that were closest to me and i hate it...yeah, making stupid jokes is fun, but real friends should be there for each other, through anything.   tonight i'm studying for finals and i would really enjoy some decent food. i've never asked for anything like this but maybe the universe will smile upon me today? i promise to pay it forward, i know that energy flows in a circle. i am really grateful for everything i do have and i know that i'm a million times better off than 98% of the world...but still...suffering is relative to the individual, isn't it? if you can help i will be eternally grateful to you and will do anything i can for you or for another person later on.  thanks for looking
0	Let me get this straight, I HATE asking for handouts. I hate it. But Im really really sick today, and I don't have anything to eat. If I ended up getting a pizza out of this I swear to god I'd be so happy.  This is also my first time doing this, I don't exactly feel comfortable putting my address in this, but my general area is as follows:  Ottawa, Canada  Orleans,  Chapel Hill  If you're familiar with that suburb, and are feeling generous, message me :)
1	Im at home with my siblings while my moms working midnights. My dads overseas and they miss him a lot. I just wanna surprise them with pizza and a game to at least get their minds off him tonight and put a little smile on their faces. but I don't have money for the pizza. :( Anything would help. 
0	Like title says my birthday is the 26th this month but I don;t have anything at all for me or my 5 year old to eat for dinner tonight. Was wondering if someone could help us out with a pizza to get us by til i get paid on my Bday friday? I'd be glad to pay it forward, thanks so much!
0	I just moved to Austin, Texas from a small town in west Texas to look for a job and try to make it in the big city. I'm sleeping on a friends floor and living out of a suitcase. I gave my friend most of the money I had to put towards utilities and bills since he's on disability and is barely scraping by himself. I've applied for food stamps and have an interview on Monday, but some pizza to help me through the weekend would be a godsend. I only have like $12 but I really need to save that for bus fair or toothpaste or something. Anyway, I guess this is a shot in the dark but I'm hungry and desperate so I'll try anything. Once I get on my feet I'll be more than happy to pass the favor on. Thanks for reading =]
0	Hello, /r/, I am a 19 year old male in sunny Miami who is in a situation that's anything but sunny. I recently lost my job (August 15th was my last day), and I've been living with my mother since the job hunt is not going well. My mom is a 55 year-old who cleans houses for a living, barely able to scrap together the $915 rent, as well as the $220 light bill, $90 cable and internet bill, and our $110 cell phone bill.   When I had a job, I'd pay for half of everything. Rent, cable, light, and cell phone. We had plenty to eat, and I'd take her out for dinner, and even pay her day's work so she'd have a day to rest.  Now, she pays for everything, and sometimes she works 2-3 jobs every day. I keep going to job interviews, but to no avail. We have no food. We go shopping once a month, but how much can $80 in food last you?  I'm hungry, /r/, I ate my first bit of food for the first time in 2 days today, and it was horrible.  I long for some good food, and I long for the kindness of strangers.  
1	I would be grateful times infinity for the generosity! ;) I am 25 and back with my parents after a year on campus (off-campus apartment) at KSU (kent state university) in Ohio. I moved home June 1, tapped out financially, lost my apartment. While living in Kent, OH I experienced a break-up of epic proportion... my partner moved out mid-way through the Spring semester and I have not been the same ever since. To be completely honest I have no idea what direction I am headed next as far as continuing my education, making a career choice, and by some miracle digging my way out of this financial grave I have dug myself into. (car is up for repo, cell phone is shut off)... yes, it's that bad. Now i'm here, back at home, not a clue what my future will hold as of right now. (I thought my 20's were supposed to be the 'best' years... lol) They were good, however, up until the point I lost my way. To make matters worse... my parents are struggling to make ends meet. My younger brother also lives here (23) and corrals shopping carts at the local Wal-Mart part-time with an associates degree in IT. My mother is laid off from the Heinz manufacturing facility she works at for the next 2 weeks so money is even tighter. It would be nice to suddenly have pizza and surprise everyone here ;)... where it is ordered from doesn't bother me, I have never been picky.   Thought I would try this out and ask. It would sure brighten my day and the other 3 members of the household as well.  (Can send photos on receipt! :D and of course a [Thanks] post).
0	I lost my job and need to be stingy with my finances for a while.  Pizza is now a "want not need" to quote my wife.  Just found out about this today thought I'd give it a try. Can provide verification. Thanks in advance!  Edit:  I live in SLC, UT
0	Me and my brother are without food tonight. We were counting on some assistance from a friend, but it fell through.We'd appreciate any help to tie us over until tomorrow, will pass this forward ASAP. Thanks in advance
0	Just thought I'd give this a shot and see how it works. I live out near Boston, MA. I am a little sick of sustaining myself on ramen and pasta though so some pizza would be an amazing treat.
0	I am starting to see a trend of some of these new accounts try and play the 'I am a cute female on the internet' card. I sit here contemplating sending someone a pizza, but notice more and more potential manipulation and then change my mind.  This is random acts of pizza, and honestly the person who gets a pizza from me is not going to be someone trying to get some free stuff this way.
1	Have recently moved to california and unsuccessful in finding work. as it is I'm in my small flat that turns out is really cold when you cant afford heating and haven't been able to buy anything to eat for 2 days, have been living off local jewish comunity who ocasionally are kind enough to give us some food, would love a pizza. 
0	First time pizza poster- [NYC AREA] So I spent a good hour cutting  fresh chicken breasts, brushing egg yolk on them, some flour, a lot of bread crumbs and deep frying them to deliciousness. Tried to eat them with my girlfriend while studying for biology in our tiny apartment and boom- plate falls on the floor. Oh, and I also lost my Playstation 3 to a bunch of Frat boys who threw a party with my roomate who by accident spilled an entire cup of alcohol into the top vent. shitty, shitty 48 hours its been. =/ needless to say- low on cash and virtually no food in the fridge. Heres a picture of one of the plates   http://imgur.com/wLsKh   Oh and also, I want to state that my girlfriend does not believe at all this sub reddit exists and that random people actually send pizza to strangers -randomly.   TL;DR- Shitty 48 hours, home made chicken fingers fell on the floor. starving. Tummy feels sad.
1	I'm supporting myself okay, and got a part-time job recently, but I haven't been getting enough hours so my food budget has been grim (think basic chicken + rice, pasta, sandwiches). I won't get my financial aid until next month, and most of this summer I've spent working/trying to make rent.   Could definitely use a pick me-up pizza tonight if someone is willing to help.   Edit: this is my first post on this subreddit, so please correct me if I need to add any info/etc.
0	Hi! I'm new to RAOP but this subreddit looks wonderful. I'm not exactly sure how this all works, but my name is Johnny and I am hungry. Normally I would get myself some food, but I have no money tonight.  I wouldn't normally ask for someone to buy me pizza but the alternative to RAOP would be to not eat tonight, so might as well give it a shot. I live in Venice, CA.  If anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated, and regardless when I have money I'll be back to here to help someone else out.
0	Hey ROOP, I recently was "let go" from my job, after asking for a month and a half to be scheduled more than 6 hours every two weeks. I've been searching for a job for the duration of this slow, twisted screw-over, but have had no luck. I will receive *some* unemployment, but it will not come in for another two weeks, provided my last employer doesn't somehow convince the state to also screw me over. It's been an unusually rough patch in my life, and I'll spare you the details of everything else, but I'm 3,000 miles from my family and they're too broke with medical bills to help.   Would anyone be so kind as to order me a pizza and feed me for a few days?  Much love, Preston
0	I would appreciate this so much! I have no idea when an interview will work out and I definitely will pizza someone else in the future! 
0	Hey reddit,  My husband and I have been kicked off of food stamps for a few days because of paperwork not going through. We're getting that fixed, but money is super tight, and my parents showed up today to help finish the tiling in my grandma's bathroom. The house (especally upstairs) has little to no air condition, and it's really hot. I was hoping to offer a pizza for them for dinner when the work is done?  They really should get to eat, and we don't have the money, or food in the house, to feed them. So if anyone wants to buy us a pizza or 2 to share, that would be fantastic.   If you want proof of my parent's work, I can provide that.   Thanks in advance.  Edit: Ok, grandma messed up and mom and dad left. Hubby and I wouldn't mind a pizza if someone wants to give one though. Just thought it'd be fair to update.
0	Just woke up from a nap and am really craving a pepperoni pizza from Pizza Hut. Anyone feel like blessing my belly with cheesy goodness?    **Edit:** I'm in Salinas, Ca (and spelling). 
0	I did a summer abroad trip to Europe this year. Cool, right? I had to take out several private loans to cover expenses at home, like rent, while I was away. To make a long story short, my financial aid advisor boned me and only gave me above 66% of my private loan -- saying I had sufficient funds. I convinced my generous grandparents to loan me some money for my flight home. The cheapest I could find was a couple cities away. After eating nothing but bread and fruit the last several weeks and being couped up in this hostel all day I am finally going home tomorrow!!!!   All I want is to go home and if I can get a nice American pie then thatd be great, too! It has been too long since Ive had a pizza! I live in Buffalo if that helps. 
0	I say "anything" but personal information is a no go. But I have some dark secrets and some really cool things in my life. This was the most random way I could think of getting pizza'd.
0	Couldn't make it to the doctor or bank because of yet another panic attack. Just need something to get through the day and make another try tomorrow, y'know?
1	While I do love ramen, its all I have eaten for almost 2 weeks and it will be another 2 weeks till I actually have money that doesn't go directly into gas to get to school (100 a week on gas just to get to school) I don't feel like I can stomach another bowl right now, regardless of how much hot sauce I use. Please help me! I have a Dominos and Papa Johns in walking distance of my house. In return thanks and pictures. When I can I will pay it forward. 
0	Jobless, just paid rent (woohoo!), and need to pay few grand in taxes. It's been really tough to make ends meet these days. Which also means I've been eating rice and beans twice a day, every single day.  Last night I dreamed about eating pizza, with its warm sauce and melty cheese. Today I get to eat...you guessed it...more rice! Yay!   I try to stay upbeat about what's been going on, but sometimes it's just hard to keep smiling. Some real-life pizza would make this gloomy NYC afternoon much brighter. It really would make all the difference to me.  And of course, I'd love to pay it forward when my situation improves.
0	Tonight I am visiting my nana in Concord, NH from Lebanon, NH . ne one care to help us get dinner?  Both of us hardly have money to have a good meal or pizza.  As a return we'll buy a loaf of bread and feed it to ducks, birds and take a pic of em (:  and Shana Tova! happy jewish new year! 
0	Basically the title. I was in Baltimore looking at some potential apartments for my junior year in school. I think the pick-pocket got me while waiting in line at KFC because I didn't have it on me when I got up to the cashier to make the order :/ New card (and ID) is being sent but won't get here for a couple of days. I would really appreciate the help, you guys.  Thanks in advance to anyone :)
0	As I said, turned 16 today, am stuck in a boarding school with no money, knee deep in work, was hoping for a celebratory pizza :)
1	Don't get direct deposit from my job till past the delivery man's bedtime... just ate me a chicken pot pie and oatmeal because that's all I got left... very end of the month sure is fun, ain't it? I work my butt off and thus, come home and raid the hell out of my fridge... but at the end of this month I'm pretty much foodless till tomorrow. I would love me a pizza right now, so if you please, buy me a pizza, pepperoni will be fine, and I'll buy you two tomorrow when I actually have money. The only thing I love more than charity is rewarding charity. Thank you.
1	I'm not going to bore you with a long-winded explanation. It's simple. I'm broke, hungry, a week from payday and have now been informed I'm working a graveyard shift.  I'm also a self-published author who is in the midst of finishing up his second fantasy novel, which will be published in print and ebook, and I'm willing to give someone a free copy of the book, AND include you as a character in the fifteenth chapter of the sequel. You will be forever immortalized as a character in fantasy fiction.  [The book](http://www.ejspurrell.com/engines-of-creation-series/children-of-the-halo/) 
0	Normally, I would cook, but it's a bit difficult to stand up right now and there's only eggs left.   I'm in the Northern NJ area.   [Obligatory picture of cat](http://i.imgur.com/aowimKb.png)  Thanks!
0	Just got everything paid off for the month, which rocks; unfortunately we're screwed till Friday for food.  Everett, Washington, some pizza would be kick ass thanks in advance!
0	Been in kind of a slump lately, really missing home (Maryland). Florida is particularly chilly tonight, and is really driving the homesickness further. Pizza would be great. I didn't just finish my finals, or break up with my girlfriend. I have some food in the fridge.. Pizza would just be really nice right now. But of course, there are plenty of hungry Redditors out there. Take care of those guys, and let me know if there's any pizza love left.  Thanks for being Reddit 
0	I've been a reddit lurker for years and finally made an account so I could request some sweet sweet pizza! Thanks guys! :)
0	hello everyone! i am currently between jobs and have run out of money ): because of this i only have eggs and soup (i just ran out of bread this morning) and would LOVE and appreciate to taste something not so bland! please help me!! thank youu (: so sad "mehhh" --&gt; http://imgur.com/QphZ3
0	It's just me and my brother in the house tonight and there is nothing exciting to eat. Not to mention neither of us can be bothered to cook anything tonight and it would be great to just chill with a pizza.
0	I recently lost my job, and I have been living off chef boyardee and ramen noodles for the past couple weeks and a pizza would really brighten my mood and help me alot, can anyone help!?
1	I'm just feeling really down right now, and a pizza would help loads. Long story short: I'm a graduate student making not so much a year. Last month, I picked up an abandoned dog in the middle of a parking lot. Wasn't financially prepared to get a dog, she just kind of wandered into my life. Ended up bringing her home, getting her spayed and up to date on shots. Turns out she's heartworm positive, but the love of my life right now. Between vet bills and paying my pet deposit ($400...ugh), I realized today I have $404 in my account to last me until the end of the month, and bills haven't been paid yet. I was sitting there thinking about what I have in my pantry and what kind of meals I can make without grocery shopping for the rest of the month so I can still provide for my dog as well.   As I was coming home and turning into my neighborhood, a truck ran a stop sign and hit my car. I had to wait 45 minutes out in the sun waiting for the cops to get there/report to get written up. Come home, and to top everything off, my dog had peed on the carpet.  It's my birthday next week, but I'm stressed about finances, school, getting my dog up and healthy, and now on top of it, getting my damned car fixed.   I've bought pizza before, and never thought I'd be on the asking end, but I can't think of anything right now that would make me feel just a little bit better. I will definitely be re-paying it back in the future. Just for now I'm in a bit of a bind.   Willing to offer you any proof...I just need a reason to smile right now.   EDIT: Got a pizza from thenewblueblood. Thank you!! http://imgur.com/DYEkJ
0	Up in the northern California, USA! Would really appreciate if a fellow redditor would help me out as I am without money and find myself more often than not with a talking stomach. Don't want to sound like I'm begging, but a pizza dinner would help me out a lot.
0	Like the title says...my wife left me and I am unemployed. Life has not been kind to me lately. I was hoping reddit could help give me hope for humanity . Thanks guys...you're the best!
0	yes my username is really new to reddit (but I'm not) and I don't have a sob story. (at least not one I want 2 post) I am however really in need of a pizza and would appreciate it if a wonderful RAOP redditor would buy me one and I will pay it forward next tuesday when I get paid. Just a nice guy looking for a break and a full tummy till I get paid. yes I can verify and I will PM u and U can PM me. Thanks for listening and looking at my post.
0	Hi. I just started school and am currently super broke because of it and I don't get paid until Tuesday morning... Anything is better than nothing. Any help would be much appreciated.  Florida.
1	Thanks in advance RAOP. As the title says, I'll be graduating on the 4th with my bachelor's! Hooray! In the meantime though, I'm broke as all hell due to moving expenses. Could you buy me a papa johns pizza here in tempe?  Thanks again RAOP! When I get my job, I promise my first check will be spent buying pizza for people here on the board :D
0	I just found this community and am quite a fan of "paying it forward" surprise kind of things. So I figured I'd give it a try seeing I'm in a rather downtrodden mood as of late considering there has been nothing but bad luck for this girl lately. I wont get into a huge story about it of course. But crappy times usually promote me to seek comfort in some way.  Thanks for reading. And keep me in mind for a giver to anyone near my area.  Good Karma to you all. ^-^
0	I have a friend on FaceBook that has gone above and beyond his duties at work.   http://seeeeu.imgur.com/above_and_beyond Proof in the pudding (O/P sooo, I may have let a 2 yr old girl color on my head to keep her still while another tech hooked her up...I think she did pretty good lol)  I feel they all need Random Acts Of Pizza!

0	We're two college students working on a final project that will determine wether we graduate in a couple weeks or not. We're broke and hungry. Please help fuel our academic engines!
1	hey there gods and goddesses first I want to thank you for what you all do.   now on to my condition. I recently got in a car accident, the bills aren't too bad but they took them all out of my account at once so now my account is overdrafted and I have no food to eat till I get paid on Monday. please help me out, ill pay you back and pay it forward to someone else.
0	Had a bit of a talk with a close friend of mine last night about the environment of my group of friends post-breakup a few months ago.  Someone in the group had apparently continued to obviously flirt with my ex (who I'm now cool with) in spite of others warning him about my feelings on the matter.  I don't acknowledge his presence anymore and overall I'm over the breakup, but it still hurt to be reminded of that moment.    It would be nice to know that there aren't inconsiderate people out there.  I'm at home today, resting and trying to get my mind off of things.  Some pizza would be nice...
0	I am hungry and i have nothing to eat at home we have been eating the same food everyday and i woul dlike something new. but my parents wont buy me a pizza and i would have to pay for it but i dont have any money. Please send me a pizza
0	So, me and the fam will be having sandwiches for dinner tonight- no big but I'd like to surprise them with something a little more pizza'ie.  Problem is- I don't get paid till Friday. Yikes, right? So, what do you think we trade pizza favors? One for today, for one for you this coming weekend or when ever (hold it over my head like a mob boss, good conversation point).
0	I just started a new job but I don't get my first check until Monday (I know...monday?) and it wouls be great to give the kids some pizza for dinner tonight. We are in Indiana, USA, we aren't picky on brand. Thanks. 
0	Any pizza's good pizza ;)
0	I would like to celebrate my quarter century of life with some delicious cheesy pizza. [See how cute we are? (fyi, my British family visited, took us out for Mexican.)](http://i.imgur.com/gtysP.jpg)
0	That's it.  Been sick all week... called out during the week but had to work today - 12 hours.  Husband has been laid off.  House guest is staying with us for a couple days before he goes to an ashram for several months.  I'm tired and really don't want to have to cook dinner tonight after my commute home... but also don't have the cash available for take out.  Will spread your kindness! In Berkeley, CA.
0	Greetings!  My parents are in the process of moving into their new home after being homeless for about a month. There have been a lot of really frustrating and stressful developments over the past nine months leading to my parents moving into this new home. I've taken most of this week off of work to come and help with this transition.  Unfortunately, after I arrived I learned that they have delayed the actual move-in days because the previous owner was a "crazy cat lady" and the house still reeks of urine. (There are visible signs of spraying in some of the rooms.)  I have learned that over the weekend my mother spent most of her time shampooing, and re-shampooing all of the rooms. Today my father and I spent most of the day addressing  and then moving in the heavy furniture and furnishings. Hopefully if all went well with the previous cleanings, we'll be able to start moving the majority of items into the home. (Unless it is decided that the carpeting will need to be replaced first.)  Anyway, long story short, it would be fantastic if we could have pizza for dinner tomorrow (Tuesday) night. I'm not financially able to supply any food while I'm staying here, and I was hoping that maybe someone would be willing to help us out.  Thanks!
0	Hey redditors,   I saw the article on CNN.com about this place, and figured I'd give it a go. I know that as a new redditor I probably won't get anywhere right off, but I figured I'd give it a try as I'm tired (and nearly out of) of ramen.  Management at my work has cut all of the cashiers' hours down to 25hrs a week. As it is, I barely could afford to pay rent and utilities and get decent food before the cuts... and now, I'm living off of however much ramen I can buy with my paycheck and still keep my bank accounts open, which is not good since my car is still (hopefully) waiting for me to pay off its repair bills.  And to top it all off... I'm currently sleeping on an air mattress, as my regular one is infested with Bedbugs, courtesy of my apartment complex.  This year is not being kind to me so far &gt;.&lt;  For proof... an image of my pantry: http://img35.imageshack.us/img35/6219/photo0074e.jpg  To anyone who helps, a big thank you from the bottom of my heart.  --Christopher  *Christopher sets off to discover what Reddit is all about*
0	I'm not gonna lie, money is tight for just about everyone. My mother lost her second job a month or so ago. We've been fine but the fridge is usually close to empty. Except lately its filled with eggs. Literally three fucking cartons. I've been looking for a job for a while and finally got one. But I don't start work for about a month so I can't as of yet contribute to the household. So I beg of you Reddit, please send me pizza because as good as eggs are, I fear I may soon suffer a heart attack or turn into an egg myself.
0	Feeling kinda depressed, had four interviews since then and I got nothing. My daughter and I would enjoy a pizza tonight for dinner.
0	I'm just being random and asking for a random person to send me a pizza. My life is okay, school is going decent, and I'm not dirt poor. I would really like a pizza because I'll be home alone tonight as my roomates are going out with their girlfriends and I'd prefer not to be a third wheel. My dog would appreciate the crust. Thanks.   Will provide picture of said dog with crust if my request is fulfilled. 
0	With my roommate and we're both broke until Monday but would appreciate pizza! Including verification in comments...anything would be appreciated - hoping to have enough for tonight and tomorrow &lt;3 :)  Edit: Forgot to put in location! We're in Phoenix/Tempe area.
0	would really like a stuffed crust meat lovers pizza from pizza hut with 2 ranch cups, reason -pregnant and craving one:)
0	Hardworking canvassers for Clean Water Action are in need of morale boosting pizza to help make the world a cleaner, safer place.  You can probably understand how hard it is to be a non-profit in our current economy. Any help to improve the effectiveness of our canvassers is appreciated.  Thanks from the canvassers and the Earth
1	Life is rough as is but especially when your job shorts your check 8 hours.  I get paid again Wednesday though and that check will have the hours I was missing from last pay day added on.  I'm in Dallas, the Cowboys scored over 20 points last night and Papa John's has a promo for 50% off.  With half off, I figure I can be fed until Wednesday.  Help?  I will definitely pay it forward.  :EDIT:  Request fulfilled.
0	Been sick, nothing too bad just flu like cold. Only have been eating soup, thus haven't stocked up on food for a while. I will pay it forward for the holidays!
0	To whom it may concern,  Hi there, my name's Melissa. I'm a 22 y/o mom/student at Ohio State. Things have been going well in school, but with summer classes the bills have been building up. I haven't had a chance to go to the store and my son has been asking for pizza all week. I hate to deny him but pizza is so cost-ineffective for me it's hard to say yes and not feel a bit guilty afterwards. If anyone would be willing to help out a good cause I'd appreciate it.
0	Hey, I'm a broke college student, would really appreciate a pizza.  I'll pay it forward when I can
0	A pizza would be lovely
1	A friend of mine told me about this subreddit.  Maybe you guys could help me out.  I get by paycheck to paycheck, but I do alright for myself.  I, however, don't get paid until Thursday and I am not too proud to say I could use a pizza to munch on for the next couple of days until I can get to the store.  I have about $10 in my account, so I can get some food, but I also need gas and it's hard realizing that the gas is actually more important than food right now.  I'm in Alabama, if that helps at all.  Edit: Wow... thank you bakersdozen13.  I honestly didn't know what I was expecting, but this immediately fixed my problem for the next couple of days.  I'll be back in here after payday to pay it forward! ^_^  Edit 2:  Just picked everything up... Holy friggin god!  Above and beyond, good ma'am!  I will be back come payday to pay it forward!
1	Hey,  Just a simple request for a girl going through some tough times. My elderly dog is being put to sleep tomorrow and there is nothing in the fridge tonight, and I'm already broke as it is.  I'm in MN, and I'm willing to provide any other information via PM, including verification if that is necessary. Pizza Hut or Papa Johns would be amazing for tonight, definitely would love something to go right for once, even something simple like this.   You guys are already so wonderful, I will return the favor to another redditor once my bank account isn't hurting so bad.
1	just a guy out of money after Christmas shopping for may family. no money left in my bank and credit card is maxed. i got paid last tues and had to go Christmas shopping be for me and my sister (we share an apartment) have to drive to Maine to see our parents for Christmas. i would really be thankful and be in dept to RAOP. me and an IRL friend have always wanted to help someone out on here and i never got the chance but next month is going to be great (huge work bonus) and i plan to give at least two pizza's if not more. but if you could help my sister and I, it would be awesome!  anyway thanks for reading reddit!  chunk 
0	Drexel University is almost done with finals week and I think a great reward for all the students pulling  all nights and what not would be free pizza  so if theres anyone in west philly that is willing to donate pizza to hardworking students for a midnite pizza party it would be much appreciated  I would be more than happy to help with delivery/getting into the library, or the new learning terrace
0	basically i have $16 to last me the next week. i don't have enough gas to get home. i get paid on the 2nd and will return the favor!
0	My pay cheque is being held until tomorrow because I deposited it in an atm last Friday and didn't realize there would be a hold. Stupid move on my part. Anyway would love to eat tonight and now will have 800 coming into my account tomorrow. I got on direct deposit so there won't be a hold. Will try to put an offer up tomorrow regardless of if anyone chooses this or not because I know how much joy a simple act like this would bring.  Thanks RAoP, keep on doing what you're doing, you're making the world a better place.  -woffy
0	I just recently moved to a new town (first time on my own). I have tried very hard to get a job doing anything. I am a very hard worker but, no one seems to care about that anymore. I will probably have to move back home because my parents won't help me with anything. Im 19 and going to school for film and photography. I have heard Reddit was a very friendly community. I have posted stuff before but am still kinda new to this. Any help will be greatly appreciated and I will somehow try to pay it forward. Thank you all.  EDIT:Round Rock, TX
1	I'm in the middle of a divorce. I'm picking my kids up tonight after work for their week with me. I only get paid once a month and pizza is off the menu because of that. I've got ramen and frozen hotdogs and such for the rest of the week, but I'd love for my boys to have something exciting on their first night with me.  Thanks RAOP!

0	     My girlfriend and I are both in college, and we're having issues coming up with rent this month, which in turn means we have no food in our pantry.  I have a Mid-Term I'm currently studying for tonight, and she has been having issues finding a job in our small town for two months now.  We're located in Flagstaff AZ       We'll do just about anything for savory, delicious pizza, so be creative and have fun with us... we're yours for a price!
0	Hey all i live in a very small town in iowa we have like 3 places to eat  in this town, pizza hut , subway , hardees i unfortunately dont get paid until friday and our food is running low, anyway, me and my wife have decided to on here to try and get a pizza and if we dont succeed we will try to create flour noodles !? and those dont sound appetizing to be honest .
0	No g/f (surprise?), no kids, no otherwise horrible story, just a fluke from my superiors.  My payroll dept slipped and my direct deposit didn't go through. I've already spent all my money and was desperately depending on this check. I'm a little f'd here for another few days.  I'll gladly commit a RAoP in the next few days when the suits upstairs fix this error.
0	Hello redditors,  I'm an unemployed college grad who moved up to Berkeley to pursue my startup dreams.  I've tried to find part-time work, but it seems like not many folks are currently hiring.  I've tapped my savings, and the fridge is empty.  Please, help a brother out!
0	My roomate and i woke up to the pleasant surprise of an eviction notice today saying we have five days to leave and we are still broke but we are hungry and haven't eaten all day. someone save us
1	so, i just moved to austin, texas to get out of freezing chicago. Got here a week ago with a little money to last me until I got a job. But........ I was riding my bicycle around to try to get to know the city when I crashed it.  As I lay there with a concussion and a dislocated shoulder, this asshole jammed his hand in my pockets to steal my cell phone and wallet. Then, to top it off, I watched this mother fucker ride away on my bike.  Was real shitty. Went to the hospital and got a sling. Hard to find a job with one of those. Just gave my last dollar away a couple nights ago. I'm really hitting rock bottom now. If anyone could get a pizza out to me, it would temporarily help me out. I am staying on a friends couch right now so I have an address.  I could also send a pic of the hospital report just so you know I am not bullshitting you.
0	I just moved back to Indianapolis today.  I went through a bad breakup, quickly packed, traveled 900 miles, and ended up in my old home - alone.  Currently I'm penniless, foodless, but I do have some soda.  I would love some pizza for first meal today.
1	My wonderful buddy LainIwakura came to my rescue, so I'll be eating tonight :3 Thanks to all you anyway!  This'll be as short as possible since typing is a bit painful (I am also a programmer, the irony), I'm 19, former CS student, but the past year my arthritis (rheumatoid, and osteo in the right knee) has gotten bad enough I had to drop out of uni, leave my job, and recently got the power cut in my apartment- currently I'm house-sitting at my parent's who are on vacation, but they've sort of kept an empty fridge since they've left for 3 weeks and I've come to the conclusion rum is not a proper substitute for food.  I'm in Ontario (Windsor to be exact), so this might be a bit of a pain, and I'm not sure I how I can pay you back, save paying it forward when I'm not at rock bottom. Honestly I'm not even sure where to get pizza around here :3  Thanks regardless to you lovely people for this sub even existing!
0	So this is what happened (long story short)! My girlfriend rang me yesterday and said we needed to sort things out, went to meet her and she blurted out how she hasn't been happy for a while and that i'm not the same guy I used to be - dunno how i'm gonna get through this one, I loved her to bits.  To top it all off I don't get paid till friday and even then It will be a tiny amount, I don't do many shifts because I suffer from depression, all money goes on living and its never enough - some pizza would really perk me up right now in this dark times.  George
0	A combination of switching jobs and subsequent pay period lag, medical, and other unexpected bills have left finances tight until Tuesday. Pizza for the wife &amp; 2 kids would be an awesome stress relief pick-me-up. If someone would be so kind as to pizza us today, I'll pay it forward x2 when my check clears to two other requests in need of some hot cheesy goodness!
0	Pretty much what it says above, and I'm not picky about pizza in the least. Let me know if you're feeling generous :) Little bit more info, I'm curled up on a couch with my cat, watching Breaking bad, I'm on Series 4 EP 8. Not to mention an overdrawn bank account, get paid Friday. I promise to pay it forward either equal or greater Friday to a worthy redditer that posts on here, or pay it back at a later date.
0	Hey Reddit,  A really good friend of mine is currently running out of money waiting for the end of the semester at her college in Wilmington, DE. She's running low on food and money, and is feeling down since a lot of her friends have moved out for the semester. A pizza for her would be really, really awesome. Thanks
0	I got a new smoker a few weeks ago, and decided I wanted to make beercan chicken for the first time.  I had never used a smoker before, but I had smoked food in normal grills.  Anyway, Walmart only had mesquite and hickory wood chips, which turns out are both terrible.  I couldn't get the smoker to the proper temp, and the smoke "flavor" is one of the worst things I have ever tasted.  Needless to say I wont ever be doing that again.  If you could help out by sending a pizza so I don't have to go to bed on an empty stomach, I would really appreciate it!
1	me and my two roommates all work minimum wage jobs and pretty much live paycheck to paycheck, on Mondays our local Domino's (which is right next to our house) in St. John's, NL has 5$ pizzas and usually one of us have the money to get a couple of pies...we've all had a really hard week including a death in the family and flooding basements and we've all gotten the same flu so our checks have been short due to loss of hours; my roommate and I who are Reddit fanatics decided to come to you fine people with this simple request for a couple of 5$ monday medium pepperonis; and we promise to pay it forward to another redditor next week! thanks for listening
1	my name is andrew kim im a undergrad student at ucsd (structural engineering major) and ive been out of funds for the past week. i live on camino raposa and earlier this week i was on my way to vons to buy some groceries when a random guy came up to me in his infiniti and asked desperately that he needed gas to go to irvine. first thing i thought was to help him out cause it reminded me of the saying "today you, tommorow me". So i decided to lend him money for gas because the person seemed to be dressed properly, had a decent car, and didnt seem to be a scammer to me. he took me to the nearest atm and i thought he would just ask for 40 dollars for a full tank when he said that he would appreciate around 160 dollars which he could pay back this upcoming saturday. i had 100 dollars in my debit card...so i gave him 80. 20 for myself to buy some needed groceries. He then left repeatedly thanking me for my generosity and said that if i called him this saturday he would repay me the amount as well as a gift certificate at a restaurant that he works at. Now it is sunday, i called him around 10 times on saturday and has not picked up. At this point i am guessing that he isnt going to be paying me back and now i have no money for any kind of food and am very hungry atm. i cooked rice and ate it by itself because i didnt have anything to cook but i am still starving. i would appreciate any kind of kindness reddit
0	THIS GUY!! I was gonna do a weird punchline involving some kind of cuddly animal, but then I realized most animals don't have thumbs...or do they...? Anyways I'm going to be honest here, I really am hungry; totally famished, and I've been listening to my stomach growl since I've woken up. Basically I'm waiting for school to start so I can receive my financial aid in order to purchase books and more importantly FOOD. Unfortunately that isn't for another 2 weeks....which has kind of left me in a desperate situation. Hence the RAOP request. For those wary gifters out there I know...this is a new account and thus this request will probably be treated as a scam but I assure you that I am indeed a real live hungry college student. Starving, some might say, stupid as well for hoping $150 could buy me a months worth of food, but alas, a man can dream. Anyways, a pizza or a gift card would really go a long way; a gift card more so because I would stave off hunger as long as possible, but any food right now would be fantastic and I would really appreciate the help. Well, thanks for reading.
1	I just graduated and realized I have no job and and $35000 in student loans. I haven't even been able to celebrate my graduation much at all because I don't have money.  A free pizza would really make me feel better about my situation in general, at least for a little while.  I know there are a lot of people in more need than me and I want to leave this subreddit better off than I found it. So, I definitely plan on buying pizza for random redditors in need once I have a job.  Forgot to mention: It's my last 48 hours in NYC before I move upstate.  **Edit:**   The good news: A very kind person who wished to remain anonymous sent me a $20 e-gift card to Pizza Hut!  The bad news: Even though I live in New York freakin' City, there is no pizza hut close enough that delivers to me! And I don't have a car. So, as of right now, I am unable to use it.  The second good news: I am moving soon. So, I will either use this in the near future or I will just pass it on to some other individual in need!  So, thank you RAOP! I am pretty happy right now, even though I am not eating pizza at the moment!
0	This is a throwaway/new account, but please don't let that scare you away. I am just your average 30 something unemployed, unpublished, unshaven (the 3 U's) author wannabe with a dream of getting published. I don't believe that things in life are free and I won't start believing that now. I'm offering to write a small but entertaining fantasy story for you. And yes, it has to be SFW and such as I will post the contents of this story for all to read.  If you'd like to read about a murder/mystery with break dancers or prefer your gnomes to carry gnome-made machine weaponry while riding raptors, I'm your man. You can toss some ideas my way if you're looking for something extra strange.   Please note, I am hungry but I feel much more comfortable working for my food. Thank you for reading my post and remember a day above ground is always better than the alternative. Make each day count! 
1	I love my girlfriend very much but unfortunately I have no money what so ever to buy her anything for her birthday today! She has been saying that she craved pizza for the last couple of days, as much as she might like my gift of music, it isn't a pizza...  I was hoping one of you kind redditors might be able to fulfill the pizza wish! I know that if fulfilled it would make my GF the happiest and I will post pictures of us eating it together :D
1	Who wants a pizza on Monday after a hard day at work? Help a guy out :)
1	I have asked once and I deleted it due to comments that where made. A nice person wrote me and told me this is called trolling and to post again. I need help feeding a family of six tonight. Could anyone possibly help me with a couple of large pizzas and maybe something cold to drink. As god as my witness when i am able to I will return the favor. Either way God Bless and please pray for our family prays move mountains
0	I'm just getting out of a three day gaming comma with the Uncharted Series. The game was so good I couldn't put it down. Now that it's over, I'll be making any repairs that need be done in my life and continuing it. Sad to say, this binge wasn't premeditated and I am low-on-funds. I haven't had a real meal in three days. I not sure how to say this better so: Please buy me some pizza! I'm so damn hungry!
0	I've never done this before, but, it doesn't hurt to describe myself. 18, living away from home, barely enough to cover rent in the bank and starving. Pretty, pretty pleaseeee. I'd kill for some Domino's, right now.
0	An Xmas party tradition is being rekindled by some of my friends tonight and it would be great if there were some pizza there to soak up whatever it is we'll be drinking. We're mainly students and/or poor loveable folk, we would really appreciate something pizza based tonight :).    Will of course pizza it forward in the new year when my student loan comes through
0	Hi Reddit,  I've been a long time lurker of your FUU memes through my friend's links. I'm reaching out to you since I  moved to nyc this summer to start grad school and can barely afford living here, let alone cover my expenses. I've been living off Ramen noodles and PB&amp;J sandwiches for the past 2 months and could really use a pick me up.  
1	**Warning:** *This may be cheesy.*     I would sure love a pizza   the problem is, I'm broke   I would use 420 as a reason   but I cant, cause I don't toke    my mouth is a' watering   just typing this freakin poem   sauce and cheese and cheese and sauce   and Mountain Dew a flowin'    oh how I could only hope   to burn my lips tonight   on a steaming melty greasy peice   of a glorious pizza pie    Im not here to look for pity   but on this poem I must amend   I felt like a baller on last friday   but Im counting change this weekend    The food in the fridge is old and moldy   even though once it was hoarded wealth   I would clean it out but I cant   'cause it would be hazardous to my health    basically what Im saying is   I love pizza more than life   and I would LOVE to take you guys up   if someone's a' offerin' a slice    *Seriously though, you guys are awesome. I love Reddit.* 
0	Really really hungry and broke.
0	My name is Alaina. I'm 6 months pregnant, and we need help. Our family is large and we're running out of food. We won't receive our food stamps for another week, and no one has any money to even attempt to buy food. We're hot, hungry, and would be extremely grateful if we could receive anything.  **EDIT:** I'm willing to prove my situation via photos with date stamps in a PM.
0	Things are looking down for me. No job and no money mean i will have to move out of my place. Trying to keep my head up as much as possible. I could really go for some pizza to keep me going.
1	I'm in North Carolina.
0	It's her 21st birthday and I wanna surprise her with a pizza for her inevitable drunk munchies. That's pretty much the jist of it, but let me know if you want more details.
0	In between paychecks and no food left in the apt. I have been trying to ration the food I had left to last until next week. Turns out I miss calculated. I have been out of a job for about 2 months now and just got another one a couple weeks ago, my next paycheck should be enough to cover everything, but until then I'm flat broke and can't even afford the gas to put in my bike to get to work. A nice hot meal other than the ramen Ive been eating would be nice right now. Any help?
0	Hello i am in college and i have not had pizza since the roommates left for summer, i live two houses from a pie jiont and have been smelling the good stuff all day, do not have the funds and it would make my day to nom on some za'  Thanks
1	I work at an electronics store over here and I need something for lunch today and tomorrow. I have some change but I really don't feel like just eating cheez-its today haha. I plan on taking my lunch break at around 4 or 5pm. Then I would save the rest from today for lunch tomorrow and maybe Thursday. I promise to return the favor when I get paid this weekend to you or anyone else on here that needs some pizza in their lives :)
0	I packed up my entire apartment today and only have enough money to make it to maryland(I hope) I have less then $100 to my name
0	There are four of us here, and we're starving. We could use a nice pick-me-up before next week's finals. We'd really appreciate a pizza or gift card. We are in Los Angeles, CA.
1	Just what it says. If you want me to do a random act for pizza, let me know what it is and how to prove it. Sorry, I don't have a cat. My apartment doesn't allow it. I'm doing this as an experiment and as a treat for my girlfriend. (I will eat the pizza with her.) I live in a major city, if that helps for ideas.  Edit: Okay! Here is http://youtu.be/2wy4UyWBtgY It is still uploading cause I'm an idiot. Enjoy when it is done! Edit2: Sorry reddit, it'll be about 1AM PST before it's done "processing." I guess I used a dense format. Edit3: Hooray, it's done!
0	Simple as that. Just chilling. Pizza would be cool.
1	Hey,   So I'm currently on winter break, and  I've been waiting for a check from my parents since I've been unable to go home for the holidays. Unfortunately it didn't come today and now I'm broke, with literally no food. Literally none. I hope it comes in the mail tomorrow if so I promise to get someone a pie. I can take a picture of my fridge if need be.   If someone is able to do this I can also pay it forward tomorrow :). 
0	I'm a little broke, but not super broke.  I have stuff to cook.  So, I'm not really begging for pizza as there are other people who probably need it more.  I was just wondering if anyone has come across any good coupon codes recently... I know I've seen them posted here before, so I figured I'd ask.
0	I ran out of money yesterday and I don't get paid for another week, but I would still love pizza. PM me for details. (IE address) 
1	Pretty simple here. Just hungry and wont get paid for a little bit so looking to see if a fellow redditor would be willing to help me out for the night. The major 3 are all within distance of me and will be able to pay that person back once paid. 
0	My girlfriend and I live together and usually rely on her pell grant money to get us through the semester. Unfortunately, this year, we were both denied financial aid. Luckily a member of her family took out a loan so she could go to school. I cannot. So here we are, knowing our paychecks are going to pay our late rent instead of food, which we have run out of. Tomorrow i plan to go sell some things to the pawn shop to get us through for a while. But we haven't eaten today. I know this is asking for a lot. But I don't see us being able to eat for at least another two days. Could someone help us out? Thank you for reading this.
1	I can offer you my sob story, but I don't think that would be too appreciated, haha... So in short, my mom and I are both students, and completely broke. I work but get very few hours (overnights, and hours have been getting cut like crazy recently), and my mom is currently unemployed and has been trying really hard to find a steady job (her school schedule doesn't make it as easy as it had been before she went back). More than willing to repay when I get my taxes in! Thanks :)
1	So I had a phenomenal day on Friday, I have to tell you all about it.   I went into work and was called into the office of the Manager who runs the whole establishment, mind you I've never even spoken to the man. He begins grilling me about some sensitive information I had leaked and wants to know how I found out. I have two choices, give him a name, or be fired.  What was the information? Well I asked the sous chef's mother how her daughter was doing after not getting the job. Apparently no one knew she hadn't gotten it yet somehow I did.  How did I find this information out? A random conversation with a co-worker about who the new chef is going to be.  Nothing fishy in the whole thing. I was going through my day-to-day work life without a care in the world and bam, I'm in my boss's, boss's, boss's office under the microscope being pushed for a name and I couldn't for the life of me remember who told me what seemed to be such trivial information. So just like that I got the hammer.  I somehow took the news alright. I mean, I was definitely plotting my revenge on "the man" and making plans to build my own corporation that would ravage their puny establishment until it begged to be put out of it's misery, but my head was up and my spirits were high.  I drove out of the parking lot and hit the job hunt immediately. Which lasted all of about 30 minutes when it ended abruptly and I found myself underneath a 2006 Dodge Charger.   The driver, not wanting to waste the precious moments of their ever important life, decided to skip the traffic at a stop light by driving up the shoulder and wound up directly on top of me, totaling my bike.  So now we're at the present moment. I'm on my 5th day of leg elevated bed lock down, the bills are still coming in, and the hunger is rumbling. I heard about this subreddit and thought I'd give it a shot. Even if I there's no pizza to be had it was nice to tell the story. I hope you enjoyed it and thanks in advance for filling a crippled mans tummy! hahaha
0	Just go home from work (started at 4am) and have to do it again tomorrow.  Too exhausted to cook and if I did it would take too long to make and clean up as I need to go to bed soon to get up again for my shift tomorrow.  Help feed me for the week.  Please.  I'll be so grateful and pay it forward when I can.&lt;3
0	Lost my job at an insurance company this past month due to lawsuits straining payroll but I was able to pay back my school (owed money for FAFSA overpayment) in order to enroll in the upcoming fall semester!   Bad part is, I'm kinda tapped out while waiting for unemployment to kick in while I search for a job. 
0	I'm a full time photography student, and I really don't have money to spare. My brother pre-ordered Skyrim for me and I'd love some pizza for when I play on Friday evening. I know I'm not as down on my luck as some other posters, but I have a pretty good knowledge of photoshop and I'll do my best to fulfill any requests for pizza! 
1	Southeast Michigander here. We're a couple living together in a small home on have been on a single income for nearly four months now. My S/O just got a new job but there wont be a paycheck for a couple of weeks. I've been floating us by but we're both college students too so it's not like we had any sort of saving to speak of :p.   Anyway, we were hoping for a ROAP with an absolute promise to pay it forward times two this upcoming Friday. We've nothing but soup and green beans in the pantry! (Although green beans are damned delish aren't they? Just not very filling. :D)  Thanks for hearing me out &lt;3 
0	My wife and kids, and mother in law left this morning to Washington state to visit her family she hasn't seen in about 20 years.. We saved up for airfare and money to spend while they were there.. I just got a new job about 2 moths ago. We were drowning in debt but with this job, are afloat again. well, we bought me groceries for my stay at home this week (ramen, easy mac, hambuger helper) so she could have as much money that was left for them ($300) to spend while they were there. All i would like is a half meat lovers half pepperoni and jalapeno on thin crust from pizza hut. i have no $ to spend until i get paid next week on the 20th. If you can help out, thank you. If not, help someone more needy. Ya'll have a good one.
0	Hey my buddy and I are in between pay days and we would love some pizza, a medium should be fine for the two of us. Thanks in advance and god bless.
0	I am a Nova Scotia Canadian Resident league hockey player. This is just for fun, but this year our team has had a very disappointing season. With not a single win...This is no Beggar for pizza, but A challenge We play a are 4th last game tonight at 11:30pm Atlantic time.(10:30 Eastern). If we win our first game tomorrow night someone buys us Dominoes pizza. We have a fairly small team of only about 12 guys. So anybody feeling an underdog victory? The scores will be posted online hopefully not to long after them game.  TL;DR - My hockey team has gone they entire season with no in thus far. We play tonight if we win someone grateful soul gives us a Dominoes gift card...I'm willing to do verification, and I can prove the score when the game is posted on my university website. 
0	My roomie and I are starving, a pizza would help boost morals around finals time!
0	My roommate and I just had a bad week with rent and utility bills being due. Not wanting to get evicted and not wanting to have our power turned off we had to pay both of them off which has taken all of my money until friday. This unfortunately dipped into both of our grocery funds quite deeply.  If anyone would be so kind to help us out with a pizza, i'm 100% able to return the favor this friday when i get paid.  *edit* i'm in Ohio. 
1	Girl has 2 kids, and over $800 was stolen off a debit card. no bueno.   She's a vegitarian!
1	Having a long day at work, and this week has been hell. My truck stopped working and raising money to get it fixed, rent is due on the 1st, so I'm at a bind. Pizza would be the greatest uplift right now.  Edit/Update: Exact(*ish*) Location: Carbondale, IL 62901.
0	I have a friend who was laid of has no food or resources. I myself have been recently laid off and have no money to send a pizza or anything else.  She is in Omaha, NE., I am in Denver, CO.  Anyone able to help, it would be greatly appreciated!!
0	Basically what the title says. I had a 3 day drill this past weekend and although I ate on base for free, I still had to put in $15 a day to get there and back. Very inconvenient, and the pay for that won't hit my account for 7-11 days. So now I have enough to make it to my day job, but not enough to eat. Any help would be hugely appreciated.  
0	We just had a car accident and are now without a car. Reduced pay checks just dont seem to be cutting it either. Pizza would be a nice change for dinner one night.          Fort Worth, Texas 
0	Hello reddit  A friend of mine showed me this website the other day and today he told me that one of you might be able to help me with my dilemma.  Apparently I accumulated enough points in Papa John's to get a free pizza, but I sadly don't have the cash to pay for the delivery free, tip and taxes that are involved with the order.  Can one of you guys help me out with this?  Thanks and keep rocking people with pizza!
0	This year has been a rollercoaster but I'd like to cap off tonight with a pie. One year to the day since I left home for the first time, and now I'm going back to fix what I feel like I broke. Any help in this endevor would be greatly appreciated and payed forward 2x! :)
0	Everyone has their sob story, so here's mine.   My boyfriend recently quit his job. He worked retail, and generally hated everything about it. He's wanted to be a programer for ages now and since he quit he's looking to actually do it. So, he's home all day and I'm the one working to support us. We recently applied to get SNAP assistance but haven't heard back yet.. So the fridge is getting empty to the point of silliness.  That being said, to add a little motivation i guess, If I manage to get a pie I'll build you a shrine  in my SMP Minecraft world. :D Will provide pictures as well to prove it all.  (Papa Johns is the only chain store that is in my area, but there's a ton of little mom and pop stores that offer like $5 pies)
0	Crazy, but true. I'm stuck in the Houston, Texas area, waiting for money to hit my account again. In the meantime, this old friend, who I now can only pity, played the friendship card to feed his habit, then ran. I would so LOVE a pizza right now. Pizza can make the world right again.   thank you!!!
0	Not really a sob story, just that I am pregnant and could really use a pizza, maybe a soda, too. Will pay it forward next week. Please!
1	If someone comes through, I will give you an awesome shout out in a YouTube video tonight! (3,000+ Subscribers)
1	Hi guys! Thank you to all the people who have helped someone in need, you truly are amazing people. Long story short, I'm out of money and quite low on food for the next week or so, mainly due to the fact that I was forced to go to the ER last Friday because of a serious burn on my foot and, of course, I don't have any insurance. This wiped out my whole bank account, which then got overdrawn due to car insurance and a couple of checks that I had written a few days before. I'm starving tonight and I've basically only eaten fried eggs and toast this whole week. I understand if no one can help, but if anyone can help me out with some food for the night I would never forget it. As soon as I can get my bank account back in the positive I will definitely hop on here and help someone in need. I don't really know how this works (do you order it over the internet usually? Do I have to cover the tip?) so bear with me if it takes a couple of PM's. I'll be on Reddit all night, as usual, so I should respond quite quickly to any offers. Once again, thank all of you! Peace and love.  **EDIT:** I thought it might help to point out that I live very close to downtown, so there are a pretty healthy amount of pizza places that would deliver. Thanks!
1	Having a rough night dealing with a good amount of things. Can't really manage cooking for myself, and don't have much of an appetite but need to force myself to eat something. Anyone help a girl out?  I could manage more details, but I'd rather not go into much. Mostly stress from dealing with legal stuff with my abusive ex and my son and trying non-stop to find myself a job with no avail.  Broke, obviously, but will pay it forward as soon as I can. Only have dominos in my area...thanks.
0	This is a throwaway account, but I'll provide my regular account to anyone who asks for it over PM. It's just that I have a friend who's a redditor and I'd rather she not know of my predicament :)  Basically I've been eating ramen and macaroni and cheese for the past week because I have 3 cents in the bank. The reason for *that* is that I forgot that my student loan payment hadn't already been taken out of my account and spent the money on some pillowcases, pillows, and sheets instead of on groceries like I should have.  Anyway, I'm not going to starve by any means, but I've run out of macaroni and cheese (and milk) so all I have til Thursday when I get paid is ramen. Location is eastern NY state.
1	Honestly, I dont know what to put here. Im not preggos, I have no shitty roommate. I live with my girlfriend and my 2 cats. Ive been unemployed for 3 years and Im not on any kind of "benefits". Usually, I dont like asking for help like this, but unfortunately I have nothing for us to eat tonight except for a quarter box of Cinnamon Toast Crunch. While normally, this would be totally awesome, we have done nothing but eat CTC for the last 2 days. Im at the point where Im down to trade for a pizza or two. I attend Comic-Con every year and I do have some spare memorabilia Ive gotten in years past. I would totally be willing to trade somebody some comic-con swag for some food. Thanks for reading.  Oh, i live in Orange County California, fyi. Thanks Again.  :edit:Awesome! Got a pizza tonight from "truongbv" Saved the day!
0	I'm broke this week and just had enough money to get bills paid and I am extremely tight on food. Most of what I have was a gift from my mother. A pizza would be extremely appreciated, and will be paid back in an offer-to-be. Thanks for helping a girl out! (:  Edit: Grammarz.
0	I'm not going to lie. We do have food. We have rice, beans and eggs. That's all we've had for about two weeks now. It is all we will have until the first of the month. Even then, majority of our money (about 1200 between the two to last all of September) will go to rent, bills, gas and the cheapest food we can find. So, while I'm not in complete desperate need of food, my roommate and I are just sick of rice and beans. I would kill to eat something that actually tastes awesome. Thanks.
0	Nobody is home, I can't drive and I have no monies. I live around the apple valley area. I believe there is a domino's in the apple valley area as well. I would deeply appreciate anyone's generosity. :)   Thanks!
0	I just found out im pregnant and I was wondering if anyone would be willing to buy me a pizza for me and my future son (or daughter :P) in celebration. The dad is gone and wont be coming back (just a bastard, hes not dead) so I need the money I have to plan for my new family.  Thank you!
0	If calling me an idiot and judgmental wasn't enough, this douchebag runs over my cat and doesn't tell me about it. He brought the poor thing to the vet but now he's sticking me with the bill. I NEED SOME PIZZA TO MOURN MY BABY'S MURDER. :CCCCC Plus, I'm hungry. &lt;3   RIP; Sparky &lt;3333
1	I'll save you all from a pity party, but right now I'm really unable to do most normal things thanks to medical issues.  I can even tell you about them if you PM me.  I don't need a pizza, but I do want one.  I have food in the house and I'm not going hungry, but pizza sounds great and because of medical issues I haven't been able to work recently (going back soon though!) and sometimes pizza is the greatest comfort of all.  I live in the midwest, if you PM I'll give you the exact location but as of right now it's not even noon so this is more of an asking in advance.  And like I said, this is a want and not a need so if someone here is way more needy then me, feel free to skip me.  Whatever happens to me, I will happily pay it forward when I can.    Thank you.
1	We've been pretty responsible people, my Girlfriend and I.  We've worked hard, spent within our means, and have always been on time with all of our bills and rent.  It seems that last part may have gotten us in a bit of deep water.  After doing the right thing and scraping by, it has come.  My Girlfriend's student loans have kicked in.  This has been a bit of a culture shock to us, and in all honesty, we weren't prepared.    Our total amount of bills almost doubled because of this new one.  My girlfriend has been a bit stressed of late, as have I, because it's increasingly looking like one of us(if not both) is going to have to take on a second job, or the eviction fairy shall be making it's rounds.  We have enough food for maybe one meal, and the nearest payday is next week.  It would be a great stress reliever, and an overall solid evening if me and my girlfriend could share a Pizza tonight.    It would be double the awesome, because her absolute favorite food is pizza, and seems skeptical of this entire community(Reddit all together, not just RAOP). If one of you fine Redditors could show us the way to pizza goodness, not only will you have the good karma, and satisfaction of helping a hard working college grad out, I'll also get my girlfriend to draw you a rad picture!  Win, Win in my book.    I'm located in NW Ohio, and at the moment we only have a Pizza Hut within the miles we have gas to make it too. Thank you in advance, and know, that I am in love with the RAOP community.  This is a true beacon of humanity.  Kudos!   EDIT: Thanks so much to Frankto for hookin' it up!
0	We're down at our pal's family-owned home, and we're willing to pay it forward. Our friend is leaving for college and a 2 year service mission soon, and we would love a pizza to enjoy in our last big hoorah together. If you would like an drawn picture of any SFW thing you request, we will draw it for you with questionable quality. We can also offer some motivational words for you, if that's what you'd like. The only pizza place around is Domino's. Thank you!
0	I normally hate begging but I just turned 18 and my whole family is in another country. It was my birthday yesterday and ended up starving the whole day. I can show proof it was my birthday yesterday if needed. Thanks!
0	Tomorrow I have a pretty stressful day ahead of me. I've got to do tons of calling and mailing and application filling out to do in order to drop one school and enroll in another. I'm pretty terrible at handling stress too so a pizza would be a perfect way to unwind after it all. Any from the big 3 would be fine, but Pizza Hut is my favorite!
1	Hey reddit, ive just been diagnosed as HIV positive thanks to my prostitute of a GF, and i mean actual prostitute. I was stupid enough to stay with her once i found out, she gave me a list of promises which i bought into and im paying the price. I have had to drop out of my medicine degree at uni thanks to the diagnosis and my friends are already treating me differently like an invalid - my best friends are all out tonight and havent invited me and think i dont know. I have no career, a huge student debt and a bottle of vodka to keep me company tonight. Would really appreciate a nice pizza before i have to face what happend with my life. If anyone can help please do.  thanks reddit and sorry about my whinging
1	My roommate and I are both recently unemployed, and could use some pizza for subsistence as well as a pick-me-up. We're in south Alabama.  Thank you!
0	So me and my wife are broke again until the end of the weekend. We live paycheck to paycheck and even though we are not starving to death or anything, the food budget wasn't very big after bills were paid. A pizza would really hit the spot about now.
0	I'm a broke post-college student. There's nothing to eat here and I'm been hoping for a pizza pie all day long. Stomach is really starting to grumble! It's my birthday soon, and I'll pay it forward by giving someone a pizza at the end of next week with money from that!  There is a great place just down the road from me that makes awesome pizza, PLEASE help me out!  
0	Hi all, Im a 20yr university student struggling thorugh a Bsc in maths. Money is tight for all students but im constantly finding my self stuck in an endless loop of C's. Pizza would be amazing and would lift my spirts but as I live in Auckland, New Zealand I highly doubt there is anyone who can actually buy pizza for me over here... Thanks for reading anyway.
0	I'm short on funds until my next paycheck, which doesn't come until next week. I don't get enough hours at my job, I live in such a small town that there aren't many options for a different job. I don't drive, so I can't get myself to the grocery store very often. I've been living on ramen for most of this month. I can't say how much I would appreciate a pizza. I didn't even know this existed, and I feel bad for asking. This isn't what I do. This will be the only time I ever request, that is a guarantee. I hope someone will help me.
1	I have a coupon for papa johns which gives 50% off for pizza. That's two large pepperoni for less than 15 bucks. Sadly a bit beyond my financial means at the moment. It would go a long way toward dinner for a few days.  
0	Seriously, you'd think a movie about male strippers would tickle this girl's fancy, but no dice.  I should have gone to see "Ted"...  Also I get paid tomorrow and can pay a pizza forward. =)
1	Austin, Texas  My two roommates and I are hungry as hell. We were all sort of counting on the deposit from our last apartment to help us out, but they claimed there was damages, so we did not receive anything. So, we're sort of struggling. Is anyone able to help us out for dinner tonight? We'd really appreciate it!  EDIT: Received a Dominos gift card from jetboyterp! THANK YOU!
0	This is my first time requesting for a pizza. Pizzas always cheer me up no matter what the situation is. I hope I am doing this right.  EDIT: forgot my location, Rochester NY
1	Hi RAoP!  I live in Miami and have been short on money. Chicken's pretty much the only thing our family's had since we moved down in August. (Father says it's the cheaper meat and can be spread out over days). Heh and I've been craving pizza recently (well, any other type of meat really) and was wondering if anyone could get me out of this chicken routine heh.  I don't really know what to provide you guys, but I here's a picture of my cow cat putting his paw on my hand :)  http://imgur.com/SEZH7
0	I'm 38 weeks pregnant and unexpectedly broke after a dr bill I wasn't expecting came up.  I've been living off peanut butter sandwiches the last couple of days and pizza sounds unbelievably good right now. I can provide proof in a pm to anyone who wants it. 
1	Just realized that in the hussle this morning I totally forgot my lunch on the counter. Anyone able to help out? I'll make sure to pay it forward on wednesday after my check clears the bank. 
0	Hi my name is Asia. I'm that kind of starving artist college student but I want to give you something in return for you helping me out.  I do makeup design, costume design and drawing! I'd like to draw you whatever you want in whatever style so here are some samples.  P.S I specialize in fan art and Adventure Time cartoon styles. But I also do realism and ink work.  [ART](http://imgur.com/a/hyujm) 
0	Student, had a test today and couldn't get to the plasma donation center in time so I could eat today.  A pizza would really hit the spot and tide me over until I can get some cash in the next few days and pay it forward.  Thanks for any considerations or help.
0	that is all. HALP!@#$%^%
0	My friend has no job and get one at the moment. A pizza would cheer er up.
0	Poor college kids who want to eat:(
0	having the very worst of luck lately... i could go into detail, but you've probably seen plenty of sob stories already... the long story short version: ABSOLUTELY NOTHING positive has happened to me over the month of november... and i'm moving thursday when i get paid (hopefully enough to cover the move)  i tried this once before but to no avail so here goes again... and once i'm settled and maybe have a tiny bit of good luck at all paying it forward will be on the top of my to do list... 
0	I often buy pizza and ramen and things like that for IRC friends, but they are usually too broke to help me out when things get tough on my end. I have $10 in the bank until Friday.  Order me something from Dominos?  (redid topic after reading formatting rules :p)
0	I just finished my last final. I can't leave till tomorrow because that is when our dorm checkout is. I have no money for pizza otherwise I would have bought my own. I would love some cheesy pizza pie to hold me over till I leave.
0	Community college in the summer and full time in the Fall at UH! I'm pretty hungry and to be honest, I'm kinda scared that the remainder of the money in my account won't be enough to get me to work till next paycheck...Pizza would be awesome right now!
0	The title explains it. I live in Indiana would love just a cheese pizza. no way to pick up the pizza so delivery would be appreciated. Thank you. 
1	My partner and I are currently both out of work, sleeping on a mates floor, and for the past few months have never had more than 50 pounds to our name each week.   I was  severely unwell on a day I had an appointment at the job centre last week,  and would have been paid our meagre amount to live on  yesterday, but due to my illness we will not have any money for at least four more days until the job centre process their paperwork.   We have 1 pound in coppers, and half a bag of rice to survive on, but could really do with a wholesome meal to keep us going for the next few days, especially as I have a job interview tomorrow for which I do not want to be a weak mess.  Any kind of offer will be greatly appreciated and thanks for reading.
1	Finally got a job but the way the first pay works I am without for another week. If someone could help me out that would be amazing.
0	My parents alienated me last night and a good friend of mine and his family offered to put me up for a while. They've been eating nothing but rice and beans for days now and even offered to cook some for me last night when I arrived. It'd be amazing if a redditor could make our day with a random act of pizza for the kindness they've shown me. Thank you for reading!
0	Hey. I'm an acting student in North Vancouver. I've been waiting for my student loans to come in all semester, but alas, they still have not. I've had to borrow money from friends and my girlfriend to make it by so far, but I'm feeling really shitty about having to do it all the time. I've basically run out of food again, and I'm loathing having to ask borrow more money right now. If someone is willing to hook a student up with a pizza, when my loans come in I would love to pay it back and gift someone else a pizza. In the meantime, I could provide a monologue of your choosing!
1	Hi, my husband is a US Marine stationed in Camp Pendleton, CA. He left yesterday for a month long training op in preparation for his upcoming deployment to Afghanistan. I am 11 weeks pregnant and only have a package of Easy Mac and a can of soup to last until our pay check comes Friday. Anyone willing to help out would be greatly appreciated!!
0	I've been anorexic for a couple years, and am in the process of recovery. My friend thinks eating pizza will bring me back to love food, but I don't have money at the moment. Whoever could send a pizza, I will repay you in 2 weeks, when I get paid. Thanks :D
0	My friend has been so kind to me and i want to Buy him a pizza but i'm a little short on cash and was wondering if anyone would be so kind to buy him a pizza. This is my first time on RAOP So please tell me if i'm doing any thing wrong.  Come on! Some one has to send him a pizza!!!!
0	Hello Reddit. I am very afraid of you. o Ao  I am a 23 year old from Marietta, GA. I lost my job on my birthday back in May and haven't been able to find anything since. I've been doing art commissions since then to try and boost my morale and keep my chin up, but they've slowed a bit and I just paid a student loan payment. With next to nothing in my fridge, $34 in my bank account and a phone bill coming up, I'm broke and hungry.  I'm also really scared of rejection! o Ao   Also, if you're interested in anime-style art commissions or anything of the like, please let me know and I'll get you a link to my deviantART page. After all, that will help me out just as much as a pizza!  Thank you for looking!
0	My mother just found out that because of my minimum wage job that I work on the weekends we will no longer be receiving food stamps. Although they gave us $300 a month for food I am only making a little over $100 for my own personal teenage expenses. (Clothes, school things, going out, savings, etc.) We are all really craving some Dominoes and it'd be awesome if someone wanted to help out! (:
1	Thought I'd ask for a pizza to make me feel better. I've been closing up at work for going on two weeks now, getting paid minimum wage and putting almost every cent toward rent next month. Coming home to a bowl of ramen and sleeping until time to do it all again is starting to wear on me. Anyone out there the kind of person who wants to give a random internet stranger[me] a pizza for troubles that, I'm sure, sound less troubling on a screen?
0	Living on my own for the first time, Bills are a bitch, pizza would really cheer me up and put a smile on my face. 
0	So after 40 weeks, it's finally here!  Baby Boy should be making an appearance some time in the next week!  (This is our first) I am showing pretty much no pre-labor signs, except for being a little crampy and irritable, last night I had about 5 braxton hicks contractions.  My fiance is working all day and we unfortunately are living paycheck to paycheck (which is a bit easier when I am actually able to work) and have every penny pinched for the baby.  I am crazy craving some pizza,  I have a bad gluten intolerance (almost had to be hospitalized the last time I ate normal pizza, it was the last glutenous thing I purposefully ate before I made the switch to gluten free everything), so I know that makes it a bit more difficult (and expensive :( ), but I do live in Portland, OR so there are a couple of gluten free places (like hot lips or Bellagios) that do deliver.  I would love you forever and ever and ever and I could craft you something if you'd like.  I haven't had many cravings this entire pregnancy (except meat, I was vegetarian before I got pregnant, now I am a carnivore) and now it is pizza overload.  Someone help a pregnant girl (who is not royal by any means) out?
0	Well, Hello RAOP!   Not one to normally request things from others but I am desperately craving a pizza :/ All I have at my disposal is a shrimp alfredo lean cuisine (ack?). Bank is actually at a negative balance thanks to the fees that are imposed monthly.. sigh... lol... A pizzahut Pizza would really be appreciated!   Thanks Reddit!  will pm verification to offer-er if they want it!  EDIT: Success! Finally managed to hunt down a hidden stash of cash, thanks **benkeiofthehillpeopl** for the offer!
0	Sup brahs and brahettes, I'm just a regular canadian man looking for some pizza. If you get me some, maybe I'll be your friend :) So yeah no sob stories from me, cause who really wants to read about that and be depressed all day? 
0	Thanks in advance!
0	Anyone wanna buy a guy some pizza from down under i am close to Sydney need your help hungry now!!!!!
0	This is a throwaway, I'm not ready for my friends who know me on reddit to know what happened. If someone wants to know my real username before buying, I'd gladly tell them.   So I'm honestly just having an incredibly shitty day, and a kind gesture from a stranger would really help me feel better. I'd really appreciate it.  Thank you!
0	How's everyone doing tonight?
0	I've never done this before, but I am at the end of my education for nursing school and have had a bunch of fees for my NCLEX and license that I have had to scrounge for. I just worked night shift last night on a very busy floor (as a nursing assistant), have class in the morning and have had a serious pizza craving for the past 24 hours but no way to pay for it. I feel a little guilty asking, but I hope I can return the favor someday.
0	Hey fellow RAoP'ers Just paid rent and am low on cash. I would highly appreciate a pizza and it would definitely help this weekend! Thank you for your time and consideration.
0	I need help I am a single mother on the verge of eviction with 2 children and we haven't eaten today. A pizza would really help. I dont know how this works but PM me if you need more information.
0	I'm short on personal cash, and want to do something nice for my husband.  He has been infinitely awesome to me in the last year and a half, dealing with me being in grad school, student teaching, and miscellaneous other issues.  I still can't grok how much he's done for me out of the kindness of his heart.  Can the pizza spirits bestow a worthy gift to this kick ass husband of mine? He takes his lunch at his desk around noonish. He is a redditor, and probably post-stalks me periodically.  In the interests of keeping his work location secret, I'll post details in PM only.  Thanks in advance!
0	We're really hungry. Both of us are in college, and had a few bills to pay that are preventing us from eating anything other than cheezits and goldfish. I like both of those things, but I don't really feel like making a meal out of them. It makes me cringe thinking about it actually.   Anyway, we're trying to watch the new Game of Thrones tonight and we both agree a pizza is in order.   Hope you can help us out!  EDIT: I don't know if any of you have seen this video, but it pretty much sums up our desires. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wusGIl3v044   
0	My wife and I really miscalculated and I didn't realize payday for me is not until the 15th which is a tuesday. We'd really appreciate something to get us through the weekend. 
0	I've been unemployed for awhile. Not due to a lack of effort. I feel like I've hit rock bottom. I'm going on my second week eating dollar store oatmeal. My hormonal rage is making me crave something more. If anyone is in a giving mood, message me. I'd even be happy with a cheesy bread and little desserty thing.
1	I live near Wichita and the wife and I (and three kids) are on a super tight budget right now.  She would be ecstatic to be surprised with a pizza!
0	Hi /Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, I design doom maps in my spare time[reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)  and I thought it'd be fun (and yummy!) to make a map or two for pizza. So just leave some details on a map you'd like me to make, I usually map in boom format so pretty much any source port should run it. If you have a midi in mind for me to use post it! (No mp3s please. I think boom might run ogg but I'm not sure). Also I'm a bit of a slaughter mapper, so I might go a biiiiit heavy on the mob count. I don't intend on spending more than a week on the map, so nothing too big.   And just to plug my projects a bit:  [newgothic](http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/?id=16238)  [shai'tan's luck](http://www.doomworld.com/idgames/?id=15945)  I've also done a map for Plutonia Revisited and 2 in the 1994 redux project.  [expect something like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BNYCR3rSMY)   [not like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgmG9dMJNbQ)
0	So my girlfriend just left me. This left me and my best friend out of a roommate but still with rent due. So we voted for a house rather then food. We have been eating a spam/green bean/potato casserole for a few days and I would love a chance of pace.
0	So lately Reddit, i've been lurking a lot. I've given pizza to Constructor who is a close personal friend whom I talk to often. I've always been a giver... Never one to ask for much of anything.  Lately its just been a series of downfalls for me. First to start, my girlfriend left me around october. Right after I got a new job, that was fun. Getting put into the mental ward at the hospital cuz I got so damn depressed that I was gonna kill myself.  The second to come was the reapearance of the scabies i've been trying to get rid of that my ex girlfriend had given to me. She caught them SOMEWHERE and i'm STILL not sure how she got them. The Medicine costs a fortune and i was lucky to get the first tube for pretty much free, but then I lost my insurance.  I've been trying and trying, day after day to make myself feel better - gifting people things like games on steam, pizza to close friends and helping other people like my coworker Ryan whom has a kid and a wife and always eats raman for his break because he's dirt broke all the time.  I don't know what it is, and I sit here, hungry myself, cold cuz I don't have heating in my house because I heat it with propane and I don't even have enough money for that.  On top of it all, today i'm sitting here in pain because on my way to work (which i'm missing today due to this) I got hit by a car. I ride a bike so... You can kinda imagine what thats like. My back rim is mangled, luckily the person who hit me bought me a new rim and got me a ride home, but fuck. I'm just like... STOP THIS NONSENSE!  So all i'm asking for is some pizza guys. Anyone, it don't matter, small pie, it's whatever.  I live in the New Jersey area in Mantua. Pats pizza is my favorite, but i'll go for pizza hut cuz I like most of their stuff too.   Thanks in advance for just reading. :)
0	Let me tell you about the coolest fuckin' rat ever. He got his name because the first night I got him he jumped straight onto a double cheese pizza from papa johns, like in the damn middle and me and my friends were gassed, so this was hilarious, and hence the name Cheesy Basil. He was a righteous little dude, I'm bummed the fuck out and just miss my boy. He had a tumor on his neck and the vet told me last week there was nothing we could do, I live in central VA and it's a struggle to find help for them. I gotta give a picture of him to you guys,   http://imgur.com/cpz1Lks  He always fell asleep in my lap, like, I won't ever have another little guy quite like him. Still, I had him for 6 years, and he and I had some of the best times ever. He loved to sit on my shoulder while I smoked, and I won't have my best little friEnt with me for 4/20?  It's just going to be a sad night. Sorry for my story, I just want a pizza to remember my lil cheesy bastard.   
1	Currently living on my own &amp; taking summer classes, haven't found a job yet in this town, and ran out of food :(  A pizza with leftovers to last for the weekend would be AMAZING :) please and thank you, folks! :)  also i have .5 bitcoin for you in exchange if youre interested!!
0	im all out of money, i had an A/C Compressor in the car blow up and and since its one of those stupid engines that cant have it disengaged it almost destroyed my entire engine. at least that's what the mechanic said. so if anyone in the GTA area, Canada that can offer up some help ill pay it forward once i get paid in 72 hours.
0	1. I might get evicted because my place of employment cut back on my hours.   2. I found out that there is a good chance that I'm not going to celebrate Christmas with my family this year (after not celebrating Thanksgiving with them as well)  3. I'm super broke  4. I made a fool out of myself trying to impress a girl I really like.  Pizza sure does sound nice for lunch.....please help a guy out....:(
0	I am a  broke student at the University of Oregon sitting in my inferno of a house. It's 91 degrees today, which might not seem drastic to many, but it's the hottest day since I have been at school and there is no way we have air conditioning, let alone more than one small fan. Pizza would be greatly appreciated, prevent myself from venturing into the humid warzone that is the outdoors.  
0	It would take me like 2 days to transfer to a bank account, and I have no money right now. I'd really appreciate it. Thanks(:
0	hey guys i'm a freelance graphic designer that hasn't been getting enough work lately so money for anything besides bills lately is really scarce ,really would love some pizza for now and would love to pay it forward when a few new jobs come my way
0	Hi there,  I've never used this system before, but the wife and I could sure use a pizza tonight.  We have piles of boxes of our stuff to unpack, no food in the fridge, and we're both too pooped from moving to go shopping.  I just started a new job and we've spent nearly all our money on the deposit, rent in two places, and the move itself.  A pizza would be a welcome treat.  Our zipcode is 91501.  Thank you in advance.
0	pretty broke, n hungry.  Thanks if you can help!
0	Well, i assume you want to hear why i went negative.... I put gas in my car this morning (I had 10 or so dollars) but in reality, when i used my card at a gas station 2 days before, it was run through as credit and didnt come out until this afternoon, leaving me with negative funds.  I do not get paid until tomorrow and probably wont eat until around 1-2 PM when my check goes through (direct deposit) Any help is appreciated, and i'll be sure to repay the favor.  God bless.  Edit, for proof : http://imgur.com/HTY95
0	After a few very nerve-racking days, my uterus finally kicked into gear today, and despite the bleeding, gut-wrenching cramps, and splitting headache I feel the triumphant relief of knowing that my birth control pill functioned as it was supposed to, that I am not pregnant, and that my boyfriend and I do not have a crisis on our hands.  We're at home today, me downing tylenol for the pain and him trying his adorable best to keep the mood swings at bay. We'd totally appreciate pizza as we celebrate the cycle of womanhood, the invention of birth control pills, and the fact that our few sexytimes-sans-condom this past month did not end in procreation.  Thanks for your time and consideration, and I hope that this post isn't too NSFW in content/attitude for this board - I had to inject some humor into the situation to alleviate some of the prior stress of it. :) 
0	Moved back in with my parents while in college. We don't get along well at all and so I'm trying to move back out. Finals are this week and I've been looking for a job the past few weeks. I had a few real close calls but still nothing. I'd love to work in an office as an admin assitant, but I love cooking pizza almost as much as I love eating it, and I'll take something over nothing. Also my parents and I don't talk much so I'd rather eat spanish rice all day then ask them for food. 
0	[the desired pizza &lt;3](http://imgur.com/MFm5B)
0	I would gladly repay or pay it forward depending on which you prefer, maybe even both. But like it says my gf was put on bed rest and im trying to take care of her and working 12 hour days so it makes it kinda hard...
1	I lost my job few weeks ago, waiting on my UI check. Kids are home from school and food is getting low. There are 5 of us and it would make our day.  Thanks in advance.
0	So, it's been pretty hard lately. My mom was laid off from her job as a teachers aid. There's canned stuff but we ate all the feasible stuff and now only have stuff like pureed carrots. The pizza wouldn't actually be for me, I'll survive, but I would really like something to brighten up my sisters day. My mother told her she didn't have to go to school today because she knew she may not be able to concentrate that much but my sister , who is 9 was like eff that and had cream corn for breakfast and went anyway. She is trying so hard not to be sad because she doesn't want to make my mom feel bad. She even offered to sell(pawn) her Nintendo DS to pay the water bill that came today. But my mom promised we wouldnt do that anymore...thanks to anyone who wants to help!  Edit: In GA 
0	I would love some cheesy goodness tonight. Game of Thrones and all. Also being a broke college student means either this or stale cereal.
0	Haven't had Papa John's in like two years after moving from Colorado to California. 
0	I am broke untill thursday and I have nothing to eat. I just finished my last can of beans and I am on the computer at the library typing this. A pizza would really help me out. Thanks, Michael
1	And I just ate the last two eggs in my APT and now only have a can of chicken noodle soup,some potato wedges,minute rice and half a loaf of bread in my kitchen. I've been working my ass off for the past month but recently had to put 900 bucks into my car two weeks before my rent was due. After paying rent on the 1st I had 35 bucks to last me 10 days until pay day. I am now down to 7 bucks and I work Tomorrow, Thursday and Friday. I have just over qtr of a tank left and my work is 12 miles from my apt, so I'm pretty much spending that 7 bucks on gas in hopes that it will get me enough to get to work. I have gotten pizzas on here before, and i've been lurking thru the threads this week trying to win a pizza but every time i'm to late. I know that RAOP gets these type of sob stories all day, and a lot of them arent rewarded so i'm not really putting to much hope into this. I just thought it would be nice to try and get a large pizza that I could munch on for a few days so I dont starve before pay day.
0	Pretty please and thank you from me and Dog.
0	This week has been the worst week of my life. I'm currently failing a class so I have a shitload of work, I feel constantly depressed, I don't even want to get out of bed and I only have 30 cents in my back account and I have strep throat :( this week isn't for me, I would love some pizza
0	Yeah. I get that there are plenty of people in need. I'm not really, got all the standard food that students live off of. I just felt like something meaty as heck, so here's my request. Equally happy to have someone local and lonesome come and join me for dinner and bad Australian television. Bring a dvd or something!
1	Pizza is my feel better food, but I'm low on cash right now. Last night I broke up with my live-in boyfriend of 2 years because I found out that he had been interacting with his ex in a way that was less than desirable. I don't really feel like going in to the details because I'm still processing everything. This is the worst I've ever felt in my life and I just want to curl up with a pizza and have a good cry.
0	Edit: Taken care of by /u/SimbaKali !!  I recently lost my job and her income is barely enough to get the bills paid.  We used up the last of our groceries on Tuesday.  I just thought it would be neat if I could feed her pizza tonight.  EDIT: US, Arkansas
1	We just moved to a completely unfamiliar area, car broke down during the move, it's just been one thing after another so I'm not even going to go into it all. We could really use a pizza if anyone would be so obliging.
0	I lost my job, maybe someone would help a couple out?
0	I'm pulling an all nighter tonight studying for my test, could really use some pizza
0	Hi there, my oven broke a while ago so naturally ordered a new one. Someone corgi registered needs to install it and with payday not being till tomorrow I have been cooking on an open fire in my garden, don't get me wrong I loved doing it....for a while. My family is away for the night and I can't bear to cook on a fire again lol. Some pizza would be awesome. Naturally I would return the favour to someone else in need of pizza tomorrow evening. Thanks fir reading guys and girls.   EDIT: also just noticed its my 2nd cakeday :) (thanks to Baconit)
0	I find the idea of a complete stranger buying another stranger a pizza intriguing.
0	I'm so sick of pizza but I love those little dominos sandwichs. Does any one have a coupon for them? I'm stuck at work and they are $9 delivered. Plus I'm broke.  Please help I don't want to buy gas station food :(
0	So it's been a while since it's happened, but yeah. Just got dumped by a girl I like... My brother has used up pretty much everything in the freezer. I would really appreciate a pizza right now...
0	We are nervously "sheltering in place," 2-3 blocks from the older suspect's apt, awaiting the controlled detonations.  (sorry if this was inappropriate... humor-meter may be off right now)... Otherwise, we'd order a large plain cheese, and a sausage/pepperoni.  ;)
0	I'm hiding behind this throwaway account because I am embarrassed to ask for help again. We've received pizza before when we were homeless a couple months back. However we moved recently in our new apartment and were already late on rent so all our money went towards bills. My father is lending us gas money tomorrow to get to the food pantry but today I'm not sure what we are going to do.   My husbands father is staying a couple weeks with us because he wasn't getting the proper care where he lives at. He has heart problems and is diabetic, and he has to eat which makes me feel terrible because we had to pay a more big of a late fee then I thought and I feel that we are letting him down by us as well not giving him the proper care he needs.     We have no children so I can understand if we aren't helped.  However, if someone does help, I can give them my real account name, and I wouldn't mind taking a picture as well, whatever works.  Thanks. 
0	Just a friend looking for a bite to eat and wear a smile for the rest of the day. I live in Canada if that's also needed!
0	Just wanted some dinner. I'm in the navy and haven't gotten set up to eat at the galley. Pay day is Friday and I'm broke.
0	My little girl is asking for two things for her birthday in two weeks. a Princess cake and PIZZA!!! ( she bounces when she asks for pizza!) I feel horrible not being able to take her to chucky cheese like she would really like. Myself and my two children live off less then 500 a month and that's is gross. Nothing taken out for bills and things first. Pizza or going out to eat in general is a true treasure and treat! If Anyone is able to help make one little girls 4th birthday a little more special we would be more thankful then you could ever know! I want to throw her a real party! Have friends and family over to our home for a change! To see her eyes light up would be the greatest gift ever! Thank you so much for your time!
0	Hey all you wonderful redditors! I'm a 21m here and my girlfriend of almost 3 years broke up with me last night.  I'm too poor to go out anywhere (55 cents in my account) and was wondering if someone could make my day (and stomach) a bit happier with some food? I'll be sure to pay back the favor when I'm in a better situation!
1	Yeah, that's pretty much it. I'd like to share a pizza with my roommates before going into work tonight at 11pm EST. I'm located in Hampton, NJ
0	I have an O-Chem midterm in about 3.5 hours (2:15 Pacific) I have $1.80 in my account [http://i.imgur.com/qo6Oo.jpg&lt;====(proof here) ] and all this studying is making me hungry.  (will share with other lucky students in the Chem tutor room)  Edit: Located in Santa Barbara, CA. Here---&gt; http://g.co/maps/xvqg4, on campus. 
0	Hello RAOP! As the title says we're two guys, just finished highschool, starting college in two weeks. We're from mid Europe, spending the end of our holidays in Canada, Montreal, staying in a 2-starred hotel.  Respecting the rules - no making up stories - I can't say we are completely cashless. But I sure can say we're running short with it, and we still need some for subway, and buses.  We'd appreciate just anything! Thank you very much guys.
1	I have $0.09 in my bank account and I don't think I can bear to eat anymore oatmeal.  I've been having it for most of my meals for the past 3 days. Thankfully I work in a dining hall and have access to one majorly square meal most days, but man, in between is brutal!  I'm totally down to pay forward the ROAP after tonight, when I get paid.  And just a notice: I'm not available from 7-10 p.m. (EST) tonight.  Hopefully a Pizza Baron comes before then, since I'm hungry now.  But if not, well, there's always more oatmeal.
0	I'm going to have to send someone else pizza without having first received any. And that's not cool.
0	I'm in Canada, I had a hard day at work today and I have one coming up tomorrow (PM me and Ill give you details) I have the basics of life but I have no extra money until Thursday. Problem is, I really want a pizza. If anyone is willing to help out I'll pay it forward on payday.
0	I haven't eaten all day (except for muh cereal, but it was the nock of publix brand chereioes. Oh I also ate publix icecream, but someone left it was a milkshake. Not to mention the fact that I dropped the container spilling i....)  wow I just realized how many food related accidents I've had today. Anyways I dropped the container and spilt melted icecream all over the kitchen floor. But at that point I didn't care because my bagel was done. It burned in the toaster. Hurt but not knocked down I scraped the black off the bagel and put some delicious salmon cream cheese on it (if you don't have salmon cream cheese get some it sounds extremely gross, but is actually pretty decent). Finally my little brother (14) tried to snatch my bagel out of my hands. He knocked it into the air luckily I bobbled it enough to regain control of my delicious snack. Unfortunately, I also bobbled cream cheese all over my arms and face. but fear not! I took revenge by sneaking up on him from behind and slapping a large amount of cream cheese on his face (the good kind).  yeah. That was my day today (not to mention all the college apps I did). This is why I deserve a mushroom pizza. Cheers.
0	Well, they say when things get worse the shit hits the fan. Well in my case the shit hit the fan, the fan blade let loose, and smashed into my damn window!  Lost my job, bank account is under, Lost all of my groceries i just bought when the power went out, and my car is acting like its gonna kick the bucket.  All that being said, being I have no food, I sure could use a tasty pizza. At least the only thing good about my day could be what lies in my stomach.
1	Hello, RAoP. I am currently sitting at my desk at work looking over my checkbook register, sighing at the fact that I have $1.85 left to last me until May 3rd. Yesterday I spent my last little bit of money on a birthday present for my daughter, who turns 4 tomorrow. It has also been raining the last week and a half. Could really go for a tasty pizza when I get off of work just to cheer me up, and will pay it forward hopefully on the 3rd when I get paid again.   Thanks for reading.
0	I'm lucky that internet comes part and parcel with my rent. I work retail grocery and summer hours are murder on the wallet. I have to hustle managers just to get a good 20-25 hours a week, when I used to push the part time hour limit.   I hate begging, but my stomach is scoffing at me and calling me a proud asshole. So here I am :). Just one is all I ask.
0	Hey RAoP, long time lurker, first time poster here. My bank account has $2.78 in it, and my car is on E. Meaning that I can't drive home this weekend to celebrate the Super Bowl with my family, and I'll be eating canned soup again tonight. I already had that for lunch and I would really love a pizza. My loans come in next Monday (they would have come in sooner but the Fin Aid office screwed something up). I'll gladly return the favor if you help me out tonight! Also, I just aced my Income Tax test that's I've been studying for all week, and last week I made a 98 on my managerial accounting test! :)
0	My mate just broke up with his long time girlfriend so we are having a lads night to help him get over it.
0	First time requesting. I don't really have a sob story. I am also not that poor, and there are probably those who need food more than I do.   But I have not been able to eat well lately as I have been needing to save money. I am driving to another state that is over 3000 miles away. Recently unemployed and hoping to find a position there. Things are just so uncertain and kind of gloomy for me lately, something like Pizza would definitely cheer me up. Thank you
0	Hi Reddit! Today's my birthday! Yey? I don't know if I should be excited about that.. My dad has just recently moved to WV for a new job, but I can't come with him since I still have classes here in LA.. This is the first time I'm living alone..  Help me out?
0	My extremely supportive boyfriend has allowed me to follow my dream, and supports the both of us with his salary. I have a vintage store on Etsy, and within the last year I've found it's truly my passion.  Without a doubt, my boyfriend is one of the most kindhearted and caring people I've ever had the honor of knowing. He gives me support and tells me that my happiness is worth us counting pennies. He allowed me to search for, and find my passion.  We live a life without credit card debt, and choose to pay with things upfront in our daily lives. We pay our bills, but do not have any spending money. We spend every penny simply on our necessities, so much so that we've only been on two real dates in our 10 months of being a couple.   I would really appreciate any kindness to repay him with a warm and toasty pizza! I can easily verify who I am, and would greatly appreciate and kindness from reddit!  Thank you and have a great weekend everyone!  Edit: My location is in Grand Rapids, Michigan 
0	I work a manual labor job, and I'm so hungry right now.  This is my first time doing this, so if someone is willing to help me out, then I guess I'm supposed to do whatever you want, like show you a screenshot of my bank account balance or take a picture of a blue Dodge Neon or something.  All of you are the people that make RAOP go, so I leave it up to you, in good faith, to make me dance on whatever level is necessary.  I also give my word that after being paid tomorrow, I'll gladly help someone else out tomorrow night.
0	My daughter came home with an awesome report card and I'd love to take her to Westshore Pizza in Tampa for dinner tonight.  Will gladly pay it forward next month when I have some extra cash.
0	My girlfriend and i got kicked out a little over a week ago from our apartment after we both lost our jobs working with the portland water bureau ...i have eaten a half of a sandwich at my friends house 2 days ago and got some free water at mcdonalds and stuff over the last few days... but in a week we have really eaten nothing and we are house sitting for a friend. He is offering to give us both $20 for a 3 day house sit,But he doesnt get paid till Saturday, and there is no food in this house, (2 pieces of stale bread that we ate) its our first night and we have no money. I was using my friends internet at his house looking for jobs and i cam upon an email from a friend who works with children with special needs, and he gave me the URL to this website. So i am hoping anyone who has a kind heart to feed an honest hard working man and girlfriend for a night or two would be willing to help us out with some pizza. Thanks in advances.
0	I have never been so scared in my life. My daughter and I were walking home from the park, when a man approached us. He asked me if I could spare some change. We were near the vending machines, so I assumed that was what he needed the change for. After handing him the change, he reaches into his back pocket and pulls out a gun. He took my purse, my watch, my wedding band, and my daughters ipod. I am shaking as I type this because I can't believe that something like this could happen in this community. I am the type of person that would give the shirt off my back to someone if they needed it. Now, I'm without cash, my cards have been cancelled and I literally have nothing.   The police said someone else was robbed a few days ago and think it may be the same person. I filed a police report and I hope the find the SOB. Pardon me, but it's the truth. If the man was in desperate need for help, I would have been willing to help him. He not only took from me, but he also took from my child and I was powerless to stop it from happening.   I hope someone can buy a pizza for my daughter and I tonight. I realize it's late, but we just don't have enough food in the house to wait until Monday when my banking situation will be resolved. I can provide a copy of the police report and any other verification information you may need. Please, I am begging for help. We are in St. Louis.
0	Hi everyone,  I pizza'd someone last week(unfortunately they never posted a thanks, but i can post some screenshots of our conversation) &amp; its a non pay week, hoping someone will send me a pizza tonight for dinner.   
0	I had to take the week off in order to move in, so I didn't bring home any tips which would normally get me through. If I could get a pizza to hold me over the next evening and lunch/dinner tomorrow, I could make it last until Saturday and have enough money to pay it forward on demand.  If anyone could help me out, I would be so incredibly grateful and if there is any way I could help you out even besides a random act of pizza, I'll do what I can to the best of my ability (provided it is completely reasonable; I'm sure I can take out an entire high rise of elite bodyguards guarding your kidnapped grandmother, but I don't really have the time for it in my schedule).
0	For those who don't know, AP classes are high school classes that allow the opportunity for college credit at the end.  Tomorrow I have AP Calculus AB, Friday I have AP US History and AP European History, and next Wednesday I have AP English Language and Composition.   I've been studying my ass off and craving some good (or crappy, I'm not really that picky) pizza, and it occurred to me that there's a subreddit just for this! 
1	Hey RAOP! It's lunch time and I'm hungry.  I have 2 bucks in my bank account but I have the feeling that is going to go to gas so I can get to my new gig on Friday.  I have some vegetable soup, and a can of tuna, and some chocolate chips(?), so its not like I'll starve to death or anything.  I'm just a guy who loves pizza.  I love smelling it, looking at it, eating it, eating it when its cold, eating after heating it up in the toaster oven again so it gets nice and crispy... mmmm...  no expectations, I'll delete this in 2 hours or so if i need to [edit: i won't delete this, apparently that is a bannable offense!].  Thanks everybody, keep up the good work!  EDIT:  Thanks to SarTim I am happy as can be! thanks for reading everybody, and keep up the good work here on RAOP!  
0	To think such a community existed is simply an amazement to me. [My reaction upon discovering this wonderous place.](http://i.imgur.com/auxwS.jpg) I'm in no special condition the deserved the need for pizza, I simply want a delicious pizza. My only means of transportation is the bicycle, so if it's delivery I can take care of the tip. Thanks for the consideration, comrades. I wish you all a good day. 
0	Could use a pepperroni and mushroom visitor.
0	So tonight my friend and I are watching some movies to celebrate his last year of college and we are broke right now. I don't get paid till next week, new job. Its my first time... so I don't know how this works xD
1	Ok, so I feel super weird doing this, but our week could really use a bright spot. I'm a single Dad of three of the greatest junior geeks you could ask for. After a week filled with bad news, we decided tonight we're all just going to huddle up together in the living room and watch Back to the Future and I would love to surprise them with pizza.   I'm willing to offer up any verification you would like, and of course verify with a thank you post and PM to the mods.  We're not going to starve without the pizza, so if you see someone nerdier, please help them first. But if you can spare, it would bring some major smiles to my home. Thanks for reading this!  Edit: Blerg...that should have said needier above, not nerdier. I'm not sure you will find nerdier people. :-)  
0	That'd be pretty cool(:
0	I'm starving, trying to get work done, and my roommate is an asshole.
0	I am almost completely out of food and have a negative balance in my account at present. I am unemployed and my unemployment insurance is expiring.  I could really use a cheering up in the form of a decent meal if anyone is feeling generous.  I would gladly repay the kindness by paying it forward when I get back to work.    If anyone wants more information about my situation or any proof I am able to provide please PM me.  I have a verification system code available as well, please ask if you need it.  Thanks in advance to anyone considering helping me out.
0	Hey RAOP, I'm a student, and out of food, I just got a new job and I'm in the new job pay limbo... It would be awesome if someone could help me out tonight. Thanks Reddit.
0	Dear Reddit, i posted earlier but i didnt put request in the title so it was removed. Here is my second attempt. So, today i finally met my first in person redditor and i have to say, it was amazing. (ive been a lurker since the whole Digg v4 fiasco, but i decided to make an account a few days ago so i can be somebody in this community for once. Anyway, she told me about this subreddit where if youre hungry, short on cash, or are willing to meet some sort of requirement, someone will order you a pizza. So heres my shot. Basically im pretty broke at the moment. I live with a roommate but i really dont want to go through her fridge and be "that guy" who eats what he wants even if it isnt his. I make minimum wage (30hrs a wekk) in my state but luckily i work about 3 miles away so i dont spend much on fuel. I have 3 children and i was divorced almost a year ago. About half my monthly income goes to child support and random bills (i was an idiot and got a title loan at a desperate time in my life and i still have to pay a pretty hefty monthly payment for a few more months. My state says i make too much to receive food stamps so i have to pay for all my food with cash and also food for when i get my children on the weekends (i want to make sure they have 3 good healthy meals a day when theyre here). so heres where i ask, Random_Acts_Of_Pizza, will you please buy me some pizza, im sure it will be left overs and help me out through out the week until im payed on friday. im willing to do whatever tasks im needed to earn this pizza. I love Reddit and all it stands for, especially subreddits like these (assistance, suicidewatch) I live in Idaho if that helps any fellow Idahoan Redditors. Thanks Reddit.
0	Dear reader,  I would really love to eat pizza on a special occasion like Halloween since I haven't eaten pizza for several months now. It might be a strange request to send a pizza to Japan but it would make me so happy.   I found an English guide for the Japanese Pizza Hut site. http://www.pizzahut.jp/common/pdf/menu/menu_eng.pdf   It would really help me a lot and I wouldn't mind sending you a Japanese postcard back. (they also have pokÃ©mon postcards here)  Thank you in advance for all the trouble to be taken.
1	My electric has been off for almost two weeks now. My boyfriend and I are struggling really hard. Just spent the last little bit I had on dog food and haven't eaten for quite some time. The depression is killing up and we would appreciate a pizza even if it's dark and 90 degrees to lift our spirits
1	The front page brought me here. I'm in a bit of a tight spot where I have to wait for my paycheck to clear...which is still two days away. I ran out of food yesterday and all I have to eat is a bag of snack size bits &amp; bites a friend gave me. I'm down to 6 packs =|  Any help is immensely appreciated.
0	One of my PT jobs that allows me to keep teaching will involve stuffing hundreds of envelopes with my boss tonight. Pizza would be awesome, would restore my faith in...nah, I have faith in humanity. Just think it would keep our spirits up to have some tasty pizza :)  Will pay it forward (will anyway, whether we get any or not...love this sub :)
1	I live in Galveston, Texas and go to Texas A&amp;M University. Last week my tuition was due and so my school took my money from my checking account, which left me with an overdrawn account and maxed out credit card, which is linked to my checking account.   I really am in a bind. I signed up for a short term loan and don't get paid until Friday. I do have some food left, but it's all canned stuff that I am trying to save for the next two weeks. I still have the electricity and phone bills to pay next week so I don't know when I will be able to buy food again. Here's my original comment and PIC in another [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/il3kf/offer_i_have_some_extra_cash_and_id_like_to_buy/c24nm4c)  /edit zelmerszoetrop was able to help! Thank You! [As seen here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/in6nx/received_thank_you_zelmerszoetrop/)
0	I have a huge hankering for pizza, but because of my poor self-control (whoops!) in following my budget in my new monthly-paying job, I'm running on change until Friday.  I have been craving pizza for a while now, but have been holding off for a long time because of my weight loss goals. Now that I've lost 50lbs (thanks /r/keto!), I'm giving myself a little leeway.  I think this subreddit is an awesome idea. Folks don't always need a good reason to want a pizza, and sometimes it's nice to indulge the cravings of others. I will most certainly throw up an offer this weekend, regardless of whether I'm gifted one here.  Cheers and good luck, fellow pizza-seekers!  PS: I will also gladly record voicemail greetings (and other similar stuff) with my velvety voice to show my gratitude. Here's one I did a couple years ago on the street for a random person: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7shkhGnPVZo  EDIT: Forgot location! Quincy, MA.
0	Hello fellow Redditors! I am a cheerleader at my university and I moved on campus a week early for practices. I brought very little food and the cafeteria is not open yet. I would really appreciate it if a Redditor would be so kind as to treat me to a pizza. 
1	A few weeks ago my head gasket unexpectedly warped and repairs wrecked my savings for the summer. I had been prepared to remain unemployed until I return to school in the Fall, but at the moment I'm operating on a shoestring budget and scrambling for jobs. I've been able to pay my rent, utilities, and internet, and buy cheap staples like eggs and PB&amp;J stuff. Ever since I repaired my car, my boyfriend and I have been applying for jobs diligently, 5 or 6 a day, but yesterday my check engine light came on after some trouble accelerating from a stop sign. I haven't driven it again and I'm at my wits' end. I wouldn't have repaired the head gasket initially, except we don't live near enough to grocery stores where our food stamps stretch the whole month to live without a car. In the meantime...we'd just love a slice. Additionally, when I get my first paycheck in the Fall - sometime in October - I will PM you, and buy you pizza. I am a man of my word. I also plan to frequent this subreddit after every payday from now on because I honestly never thought I'd be here. Thanks, Reddit. :)  Edit: I'm in Southern Oregon. Is there something else I should include?
0	Pay day isn't until Friday and I'm hard up.  I would greatly appreciate any help. 
0	Hi guys-- I'm a college student in Atlanta, Georgia. I just finished my finals and today is my boyfriend's last day at his awesome Co-Op. I'd love to be able to make today a celebration! Regrettably, like more students, I'm flat broke. Anyone willing to help my boyfriend and I celebrate? As soon as my loan money comes in in January I'd love to return the favor :)
0	Hey reddit, longtime redditor here.. lurked for a few years then signed up about a year ago. Been going through some rough times lately. My mother passed exactly a year ago this week (February 13th, 2011), due to colon cancer at the young age of 55, sadly I cannot make it to her grave today to tell her how much I miss her, but I'm not much for hanging around dead bodies anyway, the soul has moved on and I'm almost positive she's someplace nicer. Me and my father haven't been getting along either, he is an alcoholic, anger-ridden man.. Ana and I couldn't afford our last apartment so we tried moving in with him, to help him with bills and whatnot, and he constantly berated me. I'm not sure why he is the way he is, but I think it has something to do with his mother. When I was 12 I was a lot heavier than the other kids and she would tell me about it, in the meanest possible ways. So I'm pretty sure that's where he gets it from. Suffice it to say, living with him without my kind and compassionate mom to stop him from getting so angry was nothing short of terrible. Ana kept telling me how badly we needed to save up and get out of there, we were there for a week and then it got really bad when he found we took 2 plates of food up to our room. He started screaming and calling me names like always, telling us that we're no longer welcome, telling us to pack our bags and basically to live on the street... then I decided to be clever (sarcasm) and call him a "dick"  since he found it okay to call me every terrible name in the book, BAD move. I don't know how he heard me from the hallway, but he did. He slammed the door open, knocking over Ana's desktop computer, knocking over the desk it was set up on, and also knocking her over into our bed. He grabbed me by the throat and threw me up against the wall and started choking me out, much to Ana's dismay, she was crying and screaming at him the whole time, telling him to stop and let me go, trying to pull him off of me. Afterwards he offered us a ride to the shelter because we had her computer and all of our clothes.. we declined the offer. This was her idea. Then she gave me the best advice I have ever gotten concerning my father. Leave. Leave and never look back. He is not safe to be around. He is not a good person. So to say we've hit quite a rough patch is somewhat of an understatement. I'm not sure if this was all TMI but I really just feel a whole lot better getting it off of my chest. Ana is my hero, she really is, she is beautiful and she makes me feel like I'm actually worth caring about. If you've read this far, thank you so much.  But alas! Some good news! We both just landed new jobs yesterday. We both got hired as sales people at Sears... I know not much, but for around here it's pretty much the best we can find. I'm an IT guy, actually I'm more of a helpdesk-break/fix-troubleshooter sort of guy but I also have worked IT jobs. We do what we can to be happy and this area doesn't have many jobs so we're trying our best. We don't have a car (in a town where the buses don't even run on sunday or after 5pm any day, no joke- [www.lctabus.com/](www.lctabus.com/)) and we spent every last penny on rent. In fact, we still haven't paid our security deposit, luckily the landlord is a good lady and is understanding of our situation. So clearly there is no money for pizza. Which is upsetting, since pizza just so happens to be our favorite food, hands down. If someone can be help, we'll be sure to share it with our little puppy Horatio, who is the most adorable dog in the world,  he just turned 3 on valentines day! Here's a picture of me and him: ([Horatio and Bill](http://i.imgur.com/ohDJi.jpg)) , and for good measure here is a picture of my girlfriend/his mommy: ([Ana](http://i.imgur.com/qHmZL.jpg)) . Anyway... we will be sure to take pictures and post them, as long as they come out nice and she doesn't hate the way she looks in them. Either way we will be sure to make some sort of post thanking you. She's actually at orientation right now and I've got online training to do. Thank god we still have the internet! We're so damn lucky that one of our neighbors has unprotected wi-fi, otherwise we wouldn't get our daily Reddit fix. Sorry for the life story, just thought you should know the people who are requesting. We love you all.  .  PS: When we finally get our feet on the ground we will most definitely pay it forward. Today you, tomorrow me. 
0	Got caught in the Trader Joes dumpster tonight and was yelled at by the security. Wasn't able to get any food and my fridge is entirely empty 
0	I used to work in one but recently was laid off after we went bankrupt &lt;/3 Haven't had one of their slices in awhile and I would LOVE to get some good luck today!  Please and Thank you!
1	I'm a high school student, both of parents hours have been cut so we are currently lacking in funds. To top off the bad luck, they are both sick today and couldn't go grocery shopping and they didnt have money to give me. This sounds to much like a sad story but honestly i dont know what im gonna eat today :\ On a good note, i passed a really hard test today so anything can help. I wasn't even able to eat lunch because my test extended into my lunch time... My school kinda sucks haha. Honestly, i would probably try paying you back if i could lol. But, thanks for reading everyone, i'm trying to keep my mood up through tough times. :)  UPDATE: Thanks to greasytshirt for saving my family's night today with a free dinner!
0	I get paid towards the end of the week, and have been living off of Ramen and cut up hot dogs for the past three days. The money I have left in my account is going to (hopefully) buy me enough gas to get to and from work till pay day.  I'm to the point to where if I eat any more of the same stuff, I'll probably vomit.  An online friend told me about this sub-reddit so I figured I would give it a shot, and would be more than willing to lend a helping hand to someone who is in my position in the future. 
0	Please anyone willing to send me pizza ill make sure to repay when i get the money 
0	Firstly, this is a throwaway account because I really don't want my mother to know I'm struggling, and she stalks my main account. If you want to see my main account (its over 2 years old) I'll send it to you in a pm and prove its mine. :/  I got back into town today and all my roommates stuff has been moved out, along with every piece of food in the house. That means I have to pick up his half of the rent which means i'm really broke. :( A pizza would really help if anybody is feeling generous tonight. Thanks! 
0	My kids &amp; my friend's kids are having a sleepover Friday night at my house. I'd love to treat them to a couple of pizzas since it's a rare treat for all of them. I'm unemployed &amp; my friend is on SSI. If anyone would like to help the kids would be thrilled! It's their last sleepover before school starts. 
1	Hello there,   I'm a broooooooooke college student who would be absolutely thrilled to have a pizza this afternoon after a killer midterm and day at work that I just can't afford to splurge on myself.    If not, oh well, what can ya do?  Happy Friday !
0	Me and my boyfriend are completely out of money. We have have been eating Ramen for about a month straight now. its all we can afford due to he lost his job. please help out reddit. we will when we have extra money do this for someone else in need.  just please we are so hungry. 
0	I'm 21 years old, just got out of a bad relationship and we have a 17 month old. I just moved in with my friend until I get my feet on the ground, I don't get paid until next Friday and I'm more than willing to help someone else out as soon as my funds allow me. I've never been in such a shitty situation, and I don't know what to do. I'm hungry and reaching out to you redditors
0	Hi there, I have this friend, he's my best friend and he's going through a really hard time right now. A pizza would cheer him up a lottttttt C: I was wondering if there would be anything I could do to get him a simple small cheese pizza. I would do it myself, but I'm dirt poor. You can request what you want for thanks, I don't have very much to give. But, it would be nice if he had a smile on his face for a little while. (:   P.S He lives in Thomaston, Connecticut; will anyone help me make him feel better? :3 Please and Thank you &lt;3
0	http://imgur.com/z1Be3 We cannot afford further toppings and thought better of going through with the chili, basil and Frosties combination. Please would you buy us pizza, made by a professional with the correct materials.
0	I've never done anything like this before, but I am willing to try this out. I am the proud mother of an awesome toddler whose favorite food is pizza. Today is the first day of our staycation, but I am poor until Friday when I get paid. Hoping to make my little man smile by having some pizza for lunch
0	My friend Brittany could REALLY use some cheering up.  She's down at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, FL for the week because the hospitals and doctors here in Alabama have not been able to give her a clear diagnosis or course of treatment for what we can really only identify as a degenerative brain condition.  She's down there without her husband or any of her close friends right now, because none of us could afford to take time off work to be there with her - we pretty much all used up what vacation time we had on her last visit last month.  Understandably, she's very freaked out and upset at being down there by herself and having to face the possibility of neurosurgery this week alone.  I'd like to try and cheer her up, but we spent all my "able to spend this" money just to help GET her down there ($500 just from me, and more from her husband and my girlfriend to cover it all).  Given that stress doesn't help her condition, it bothers me that she's under such pressure alone and I can't help any more than this.  That's why I'm asking you guys.  Can we get her a pizza from a stranger to help restore some of her feeling that things will be okay?
0	I'm unemployed, single, I lost my cat two months ago and I'm broke. I'm very skinny and have trouble keeping weight on. I have a few job interviews next week and it would be *so* nice to be gifted a lovely surprise pizza and of course I will be gifting pizza to whoever I can when I can. Otherwise, I'll have to pop in on my Nana for some biscuits or something. 
0	This is the last night that all of my friends will be together for Friday Night Magic.  Four out out of the five will be leaving town to either go to college or another state.  I am trying to make this the best night I can with very little money, I just dropped 1000 for car repair.  A  simple cheese would work.  Many thanks to anyone that looks, and everyone else that considers, you are awesome!  I will repay the favor to someone else in the future!
0	We are in Austin TX and are currently living on 3 eggs and 7 packs on ramen.
0	My ex left and my sister is coming tomorrow to help me pack up her stuff. Unfortunately, I don't have any money until next week and I don't have much in the way of food. If someone could help us out with pizza tomorrow, we would be eternally grateful and could pay you back next week if need be. :)
0	HERE IS THE STORY!   So, I'm a broke, recently unemployed college student dealing with some stress.   I did something i've never done before, and asked for a Pizza.   And then I had second thoughts, because I felt really horrible asking for a pizza when there are people out there with REAL problems. So I deleted my post.   Then, an amazing redditor Pizza'd me anyways, So I am redoing this post so that the proper flair can be assigned.   Thank you, Lordelf, I will repay your kindness as soon as I am able to. 
0	broke college student going through a rough time a cuddle with pizza would be nice.
0	Just thought I'd give this a shot. I'm a designer whos work has really dryed up recently, so I'm in the process of finding full time work. I live in the Newcastle area in the UK. Just after a treat for a boring night in on my own. I'm going to return the favour when I get work. Cheers
0	Nothing too special. Just packing and craving pizza.
0	I just started classes and got done paying over $500 for my books.  Now my fridge is empty and i would really love for the chance to get a pizza.  I always see how well you guys do when i see the posts of other redditors getting pizza, i just hope you can help me out.
0	I turned 24 today and I don't really have any cash. I just moved to this state a couple of months ago and none of my family or friends live even remotely close. Anyone near 22193 and want to make my birthday suck less?
1	My girlfriend and I will be broke for the next few weeks. She has a ticket to pay off, and I have to pay 1200 dollars to have my cars engine fixed (I blew 2 cylinders). After paying for this, we're essentially broke until out next payday. Just asking for a pizza for dinner tonight.Anything would be greatly appreciated.
0	Hello RAOP. I am in need of pizza for me and my pup. I have been out of work for a couple of weeks and I need a pizza to celebrate having been chosen for a PAID internship with a local marketing agency in Dallas. The program starts in a week.

1	[EDIT] GREAT SUCCESS. Thanks @ Choppersb!  Hey all, I'm a student in graphic design who just finished his summer quarter and portfolio only to be left with no money for the next week. My philadelphian ass would kill for a pizza or even a slice of bread at this point. I get paid the first of the month, but with an empty fridge and cupboard, I'll end up eating my toenails in the mean time.  If you can help me out, I'll be sure to pass the kindness along come the first--Ill even keep a donate(r) in the loop so that they can see the chain reaction ;)  OMNOMNOM !
0	I am really down in the dumps and a hot, steaming pizza would make me very happy. I'm really cold and tingling, nothing could fill me up better. Thank you so much for your consideration  Milpitas, California
0	so i was recently hired at two different places over the last week, started one job at a sandwich shop last Monday and start at this awesome gourmet pizza place called Pagliacci here in Seattle next Wednesday and after three months of unemployment it couldn't come quickly enough. Wells Fargo literally closed my checking account because it was dormant for three months! Im a hardworking guy who will be working 9am to 12am doubles next week, the recent unemployment has just been a crappy setback for me! pretty difficult. I've been going to foodbanks and primarily dumpster diving to survive, I would absolutely love some pizza and could pay it forward in the future, maybe when my discount kicks in at the new job?
0	Well where do I start? Two years ago the love of my life dumped me because for 6 months before that I had become a drinking machine. It wasn't just when I was depressed. I would drink when I was happy, sad, hungry, tired, stressed. I would even go to work and school drunk. It became a major problem when I got alcohol poisoning. To keep her from leaving I agreed to quit drinking completely and start going to meetings. Suprisingly, it worked and I was on the fast track to living a much better (happier) booze free lifestyle. In the past month my girlfriend and I have argued constantly. Thursday night she confessed she had been cheating on me for about three months with my bestfriend, who had also helped me stop drinking. My gf left after that, she came home three hours later reaking of vodka and she had vomit in her hair, in her inebriation she told me how her and my bestfriend had been sneaking around partying together and "one thing just lead to another" and they had fallen inlove. This had come to me as a shock because not even 2 months ago she had agreed to help me take care of my brother when I got custody of him. Yesterday she left me she said she'd be back for her things. I tried to go about my day the way I would any other day, I went to my AA meeting got my 24 months sober token. I went to work and got through the day as best I could crying in the bathroom on my lunch break. After work I went to the bank to withdrawl money to pay my bills, only to find out she took all my money out of my bank account 20 minutes after my check was direct deposited. I didn't know what else to do. I wont be able to pay my bills or buy food. I don't know how I am going to feed the kids, or if we'll even have a place to live. My bills are adding up quickly and we have no food. My landlord is very strict and will not bend on my rent because we've only lived here for 90 day. I am but sure what to do. School starts next week and I can't get supplies or outfits. I used my last bit of gas to go to a food pantry only to find out that I make too much money for assistance and I can't get a payday loan because I got one two weeks ago to help fix my now exs car. I hope someone here can help me or direct me somewhere I can get help. Thank you for reading. 
0	My first time posting here so I thought I'd try it out. I've been broke from putting money into my gas tank for the 40 minute drive to school. On top of that my Financial Aid got delayed and my girlfriend (and we're no longer together) left for school this week. Broke and alone :(   Thanks for reading
1	Worked until 2 AM on Wednesday night. Came in Thursday and was given two-weeks notice. STILL WORKING at 9pm on Friday. I'll probably not get him until 10pm or so
1	I'm in a state of disbelief and shock. I don't have the energy to cook. Pizza would be a nice comfort right now, considering it's the next best thing to hugs.  I'm in Massachusetts. Dominos gift card is best. I'll draw a picture of anything you want in return, if you'd like, even though I'm not that good.  Edit: Request was fulfilled! Thank you jleichtman! (if you don't want your name here, PM me and I'll remove it)
1	new in town and waiting for that first pay check (15th) living off change/2$ p. terrys burgers til then.. we spent our last 20$ today on diapers and goat milk.. if you can help with a pizza we will return the favor to another Redditor or I will make you a delicious dessert of your choice next week... (if you're in Austin)  thanks for reading love and light, juanwonton
1	Work was cancelled last minute today, for the 2nd time in two weeks.  It's been a bad month, but today has been a particularly bad day- the kind of day that you struggle to get through without crying from the stress of everything.  Pizza would be a nice break from the dreariness of the day!
0	i have been homeless for almost a year now and up until now ive either been able to get some help from a friend or been able to find a job for a while unfortunately in march i was fired from my job at subway because they found out that im homeless so i had a little money saved up since then i have been looking for a job and eating ramen about a week ago my tire popped after i had perked for the night so i can't drive it and luckily i have an old laptop i can use to access internet. completly by accident i found this website and since i ran out of ramen a couple days ago and havent eaten i figured why not ask couldn't hurt to try. thank you and god bless
0	Throwaway for obvious reasons.  I have been having such a terrible month. My parents don't do anything, they don't clean, they don't cook, they just yell and yell. I've always put on a plastic smile, but something snapped. I ended up crying to my friends house in the rain, and I was taken to the hospital.  I ended up staying at the psych ward for nine days, the doctors wanted to keep an eye on me. They prescribed some anti depressants, but my parents refused, saying that they don't think the medicine will work!  Now I came back to my house, nothing really changed. The only thing we eat is the food my brother and I cook, rice and spaghetti, and the terrible foods my mom gets from the restaurant she works at.  I'm not begging for a pizza, but I really would like one? I'll try to pay back if I can, I just need some comfort food, I haven't had any pizza for a long time, and it would really help me cope with all of this. 
0	I'm going to try to be very clear and straightforward.  I was out of work for a few weeks and unfortunately I recently ran out of cash.  The good thing is that I started working again this week but I won't be getting paid for another week.  After losing my job I felt hopeless but now I'm hopeful that things are starting to turn around.  I would certainly appreciate it if I was able to get a pizza because my kitchen is completely empty.  As soon as I'm able to I'm going to be sure to return the favor to someone else as often as possible.  I wouldn't feel comfortable receiving it if I didn't know I would do the same for someone else.
0	My two roommates and I are out of food and money until Friday. We have been eating bread with ketchup the past two days and are finally out of bread. ANYTHING would be appreciated. 
0	That's all. I could go without it...and I wouldn't DIE or anything. I am in the Bay Area
0	a pizza would brighten my childrens thanksgiving 
0	Anyone feeling kind enough to hand out a stuffed crust supreme or two from pizza hut? they are $10 each.
0	Basically i have work at 3 woke up with no food and i dont get paid till next week friday and a friend is gonna give me a loan at midnight so ill get some one a pizza back tonight so please can someone help out =(
1	Feeling pretty lonely &amp; depressed. Friday was payday and had to use my whole cheque towards bills. Just want a warm pizza to make me feel better about not being with my family on Thanksgiving. I figured this would be worth a try. Im a decent guy that usually cares for others &amp; does good deeds. Hoping for some karma here while I go through a rough time. Thanks. Tyler 
1	We are on our honeymoon in Virginia Beach and unfortunately the quality inn we stayed at our first few nights managed to double bill us leaving us broke until tomorrow.  We would love a pizza or really anything we aren't picky.  i will reciprocate once my funds go in if you'd like or simply pay it forward.
1	I am a firm believer in what goes around comes around. Fallen on hard times could use some food in my belly :) Gave a pizza out a couple weeks ago. God bless all.
0	If anyone could spare me a pizza it would be appreciated,  Student here  i moved into a flat 2 months ago and am still trying to get to a stage where i can budget out my money properly i just had to pay off a water bill so im without and decent food until Monday.
0	The NHL is back! When I get out of work tomorrow I'm looking forward to relaxing and watch as much hockey as I can. A pizza from the Pizza Hut right by my house would be an added plus. I've given before on another account. http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza/comments/iouna/request_im_broke_sick_recently_single_and_hungry/ Go Wings and Broncos! Edit: just realized it's my cake day. So much karma wasted.
1	So I've been functionally poor for ages now and I didn't realise how long ago it's been since I had pizza until today where I've been hit with an immense craving. I'm not here to boo hoo about how it sucks to have no cash - so many people here have it so much worse than me and I'm lucky just to be able to keep my shit together to the point where I've got a roof over my head.  Anyway - I'm sick to death of supermarket own brand tins of crap and bread that's a day out of date (But 15-20p so bargain, right?). Allow me to have some pizza and allay my fate.  Also seeing as Pizza Hut keep posting vouchers through my door I figured I'd better ask before I forcible return them to sender with a vengeance.  EDIT: I have nothing else to do with my time so I'm just going to chill and wait here :)  EDIT 2: Appreciating the support everyone!
0	There was fraudulent activity on my account Thursday morning. I got a call and an e-mail from my bank saying that they froze my account and when I confirmed that the charges were in fact fraud cancelled my card. A new one is on it's way, but that doesn't help me with my hunger today. I can provide proof with the e-mail they sent me Thursday morning.  Thanks Everyone!
1	After the past month, maybe its time to finally check this place out.  The great news is I've been at my job now for 3 weeks and pay day is Friday - I'm getting a room!   Bad news is, I haven't been eating very well at all - for the most part, I've provided for myself, but this week has been lean. Anyone want to help me celebrate my soon to be obtained freedom from this private hell with some delicious delectable discs of cheese, tomato sauce &amp; toppings?   I'm not expecting anything, won't mind if it goes either way, but I know that I'll be paying it forward this weekend. Also, since I don't have an address -  I wonder if this is even possible  Best wishes RAOP, you're probably the coolest community.   edit **I would ask that this ticket be considered closed - Tarable, the sweetest person ever has made my night** pics coming soon. 
0	I'm a hungry student and would love a meal that costs more than Â£3! I love pizza, so just thought I'd ask.
0	Hey everyone! So I am in the band Sleep City and we have been recording our new cd for a little while now. Before I went into the studio I didn't have a job so I had very little money for food. Right now I have eaten Ramen for the past week and I've had enough! If anyone could send me a pizza I will be forever grateful. Too much ramen intake makes Kevin a dull boy. PLEASE SAVE ME www.facebook.com/sleepcityrock
1	I recently went through some problems, and a friend of mine here has taken me in. He is just as broke and works his ass off to take care of both of us. I'm looking for work, but It would be nice to give him something in return. He was just saying to me how much he would love a pizza.  If you can help, it would be very appreciated. I'll send a pic with the pizza and my friend. :)  (I have a verification code also.)
0	lost job  starting new one  soon  but  need   somthing for now intill i  get money in a day  or so   live in waynesburg PA 
1	I'm not sure how it's possible, because the two main pizzachains here, Pizzahut.pt and Telepizza.pt both have pages in Portuguese only.   But, i've been on a diet for the last 2 months, and I've lost over 20 pounds in the meantime. I havn't had one cheating day, and I feel i deserve to "celebrate" with a pizza, something I havnt allowed myself in ages.    Request something, however obscure and i'll draw it for you. I'm best at people in various situations. Then, hopefully you'll like it and fulfil my request :) 
1	Wanna try the new p'zolo. i'm going on a trip friday, so all money is tied up in that
0	EDIT: I don't need the pizza now. I got it taken care of.   My friends and I are going to have a pizza party for the Oscars tonight and I was going to use the free pizza I had saved for the coin toss. So I go on to the papa john's website to order my pizza to pick on the way to my friends house tonight but it tells me "The promo code you entered has exceeded the maximum allowed usage" but I haven't used it yet. I called customer service but I got a busy signal. After a few tries, I gave up. Because it's my cake day and I love the Oscars, I thought someone might have sympathy for me.   But, if someone thinks I can get this fixed once I get a hold of customer service, I'll keep trying but I don't know how to prove I didn't already use it. I mean, my order history will be blank bc I created the account to use the code but other than that, I don't know what to tell them. If I can get this fixed then I won't need/accept an offer from you guys.   EDIT: Finally got through to customer service and we got it worked out. They gave me a new code. Thanks to anyone who considered helping me out. I'll try to pizza someone in the future when I have the means. 
1	Hey Reddit,  So my co-worker has been engaged for a while and is moving out to Arizona so she and her fiance can be closer to her fiances daughter. Yesterday she, out of no-where, announces that she is going to get married THIS MORNING. No friends, no family...they just signed a paper at town hall and she even had to come into work after.   My request? This girl is obsessed with Margarita Pizza and Pizza in general...she eats it everyday. She didn't come in with any today though. I'm guessing it's because she just got married with no party and miiiiiight be a little sad about it.  I don't know why they didn't have a ceremony as I'm afraid to bring it up.  Personally, I just started working here and haven't gotten my paycheck yet so I'm broke. Would anyone be able to order a large Margarita for this poor girl?   This is my first post to this r/ so forgive me if I am breaking any rules. I can provide any verification you need but I want this to be a surprise for her!
0	Long story short, I basically ran out of money back in late June. I spent essentially the entire month of July eating things like empty taco shells for dinner, my roommate's scraps from the night before for breakfast, and some days simply eating nothing. Yes I know boo-hoo, just wanted to say I found this subreddit today and it's one of the best ones!  Again, I do NOT want a pizza, only giving props to an awesome sub. You guys are kewl.
0	My girlfriend and I wouldn't mind a nice pizza - normally I'd have plenty to eat but the bank happens to be closed today so no cash for me :( any takers?  Ill be sure to buy someone a pie in the future   to clarify,  we haven't received our fridge yet either 
0	Im a 15 y/o babysitting my sisters kids and I can make them some noodles but I was clumsy and dropped the sauce on the floor so they would have to eat them plain which sucks. The only place to get pizza nearby is Dominos but its not within walking distance so I cant get them anything since I dont have enough cash to pay for delivery and a tip. If anyone could help us out we'd consider ourselves blessed. Thanks.
1	So i've been descending the winding staircase of heroin addiction over the past couple months, but i've finally taken steps to save myself from myself. I deleted my dealers numbers and got a withdrawal survival kit going (water, toilet paper, and some bud) but between that and my debts from using I'm flat broke. It didn't matter yesterday since between the puking and shitting i didnt exactly have time to eat, but now I feel like I can finally stomach something. I'm suffering through a day at work right now but I get home around 7, and there's a dominoes down the road...im through getting high with a lil help from my friends, but can anyone help me get by? i sincerely thank anyone who even considers helping me out, you (hopefully) have no idea how alone i feel dealing with this self inflicted hell   edit: one more thing, on the off chance anyone end up wanting to help either tonight or tomorrow afternoon, my doorbell doesnt work so if possible tell the delivery dude to give a quick shout at the 2nd floor front window, trust me ill be lying right there in bed the whole time. or, if its easier, i can pm my philanthropist hero my cell number so the delivery guy/gal can just call me
1	Hey fellow redditors. Trying to not make a sob story but I'm stranded in a hotel room tonight with no way of knowing what's going to happen tomorrow. Could fealy use a dinner tonight as I am stranded and haven't eaten in about 4 days. If someoul could bless my with a pizza tonight id be so grateful. Thanks so much reddit guys and gals!
0	Well to cut to the chase I am living with HCM (hypertrophic cardiomyapthy) and I have been having some trouble breathing lately.  Being uninsured, I go to the urgent care center and the doc tells me that I suffered a mild heart attack sometime last week.  It hit me kind of rough because I haven't had an episode in years and I've been really healthy. All my family is 8+ hours away and to be honest it feels good to just tell someone in general.    Anything reassuring would really boost my spirits/confidence in the matter if only an 'it's going to be ok.'  Thanks in advance and once my spirits pick up, I promise to pay it forward.
0	You buy a pizza for me, I buy a pizza for two other people on here. 
0	I have no where else to turn. My husband lost his job and I work part-time at the local Walmart stocking shelves. My check doesn't even cover our rent, I have our utilities paid and have spoken to the landlord. I am eligible to go back to the food pantry on Friday. (You can only go once a month) so I just need something to hold us(my two children, my husband, and myself) until Friday, and the kids get free breakfast and lunch at school. So I really just need enough for two dinners. I can repay when money comes in or whatever you like. Thank you for taking time to read my plea.
0	We be working the university Help Desk the day after thanks giving, we might be the only people here. please feed us.

0	Totally in need of some food! Pizza sounds great. My boyfriend and I are currently getting evicted. No money. Soon we will be going to the shelter, but we have to wait until our eviction is final to get any kind of assistance.  (Edit) I live in Jackson, Michigan! Sorry :( New to all this. My friend told me about this.
0	I am a deployed soldier in Afghanistan and I am wanting to suprize my wife with a Pizza or something cool. I only have a few problems:  * Wife is visiting kinfolk in Harrisburg, AR which is a town of maybe 2000 with 1-2 mom and pop pizza places that may or may not be open today or tomorrow. one of these is [Checkers Pizza](http://maps.google.com/maps/place?rls=com.microsoft:en-us&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;startIndex=&amp;startPage=1&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=pizza+in+harrisburg,+arkansas&amp;fb=1&amp;gl=us&amp;hq=pizza&amp;hnear=0x87d437d6283197f9:0xa55b439652fb393a,Harrisburg,+AR&amp;cid=17044012131257561687)  * The only place with Chain Restaurants is 11-15 miles away in Jonesboro, AR and I am pretty sure they do not deliver.   Anyone got any advice as to how I can hook them up. Just trying to find a unique way of telling my wife and kids I love them and miss them.

0	I have a friend over, and we don't have much for dinner. Thought I could give this a shot.
0	So one day two redditors decide they want to start a petting zoo. So one redditor said to the other redditor, "you go out and find the land, I will go out and find the animals." They agree and set off on their ways.  So the redditor out looking for the animals was walking down the street when he sees a roster store. He walks in and tells the guy he wants to buy a rooster. They guy says, "okay, but we don't call them roosters, we call thems "cocks". "   He says, "okay", buys the roster, and sets off on his way.  He continues walking down the street when he sees a chicken store. He walks in and tells the guy he wants to buy a chicken. They guy says, "okay, but we don't call them chickens, we call thems "pullits". "   He says, "okay", buys the chicken, and continues on.  A little while later he is walking down the street when he sees a donkey store. He walks in and tells the guy he wants to buy a donkey. They guy says, "okay, but we don't call them donkeys, we call thems "asses", and there is something very peculiar about this ass, you have to scratch his ass every five minutes or he'll die. "   Its the last donkey in the store, so he says, "okay", buys the donkey, and sets off on his way.  So now this redditor is walking down the street, all three animals in his arms when five minutes go by. He gets really frantic, runs up to the first redditor he sees, and says, "*will you grab my cock and pullit, while I scratch my ass*?"  
0	Hi guys, I'm new to RAOP. I'm just hungry and don't get paid until thursday. If someone hooked it up, I'd be more than happy to pay you back next weekend with some pizza!!
1	My bank account is empty and I can't leave the house because I am waiting for a roommate's package from UPS.  If someone would generously send a pizza I would happily pass it forward next week.
0	I'm stationed at Eglin AFB, Fl. I live in the dorms here by myself and don't really have the money to go out and do stuff. I mostly skype with my girlfriend/ family and study my course work. Help me ease the pain with a pizza! 
0	I'm residing in Jacksonville, Fl. and my parents are out of town for the week. Im with my 8 year old brother and we don't have much unexpired food aside from ramen noodles. I don't have any physical money(at least not enough to order food) and it would be nice to be able to order pizza for ourselves. Obviously this is a somewhat trivial situation and there are people who's situations deserve to be prioritized over this but if you are in a situation where we are the ideal choice that would be awesome.  Edit: Has received pizza from the lovely redditor, makoswimmer &lt;3
1	Hello pizza friends,  I'm a UK postgraduate student who's been putting in long hours into her PhD and is getting a mighty craving for a pizza. Unfortunately, I only get paid every four months, and I'm at the end of a pay period so money is very tight.  As my payday is Monday, I intend to pay it forward and send some hungry redditor a pie once the money hits my account.  Additionally, if you feed me, I'll send you a picture of my very cute pet rabbit, being cute. Deal?  Thank you very much!

1	June 29th I was fired from my job for "not being a good fit for the company." (Almost verbatim what I was told. This was after working there nearly a year, and being moved halfway across the country to another office for them, but I digress.)   My unemployment interview isn't until today (within the next two hours) and I can't send in my first form until the 17th. (Willing to provide a picture of the form I got with that info on it as necessary.)   My mother gets paid friday and said she'll be able to help out then (she's back in California, where I was moved from) but until them I'm hungry and all out of food. I've already tapped all my friends and they've been more than generous, so I don't think I can really turn to them.  I did the verification thing on the right, so PM me if you want the code or want me to post it or whatever. **I will pay this forward as soon as I have a job again. Mark my words.**   Please and thanks, all the best.  **EDIT: Received, courtesy of NYGalz. Reddit rules**

1	So, long story short, I have had a lot of medical issues in the past year, including 3 back surgeries since november.  Due to this, I lost my job 2 weeks ago.  I have no food or money to pay bills and was really hoping someone could help me out today with a pizza.  Thanks in advance.  -Keith From the US
0	I've been trying to get pregnant for a while. :) I finally am. My husband is on a business trip out of town, and I am craving a pizza! (: !! I have a papa johns close by ! Anyone that can help, I will send them a $5dollar subway gift card. It's not much, but right now It's all I can do. Along with the gift card I can edit photos. Papa Johns Carryout closes at 10 here, and they won't deliver to my address! Any help would be appreciated, I can also give the gift card number so you know there IS $5 dollars on card. 
1	I live in Sherman Oaks, California and have like no food in my small apartment. Gonna get hungry when smoking so it would be great if someone could send some pizza. Picture: http://imgur.com/lct7R  I would be super thankful to whoever would send pizza, and we can pm the exact location and address.
1	Hello, we've posted before when we first got to Cali back in August, but never got a response so we thought we'd give it another shot. There are 4 of us here, 2 kids and 2 adults, just looking to see if there are any kind people out there willing to help us out with Dinner tonight. Haven't had the best of luck since we got to Cali. Yesterday was Halloween, but kids didn't get to do anything other than go hang out at church cause we couldn't afford to do costumes this year.   If there are any kind heart'd people on tonight willing to help us out this one time it would be great. I'll be able to donate $10 to someone on the 18th, i realize it's not much, but I've seen others like myself on here seeking help so i'm going to try my best to do help them out whether someone helps me or not. But once again we're asking if there are any kind heart'd ppl out there willing to help us this time we'd really appreciate it.   Thank You &amp; God Bless

0	Hey guys, I'm new to this subreddit! Greetings, I'm Rin.  I've been applying for jobs since before summer started... I started a week before finals. This is the first job I've found this summer, though! And school starts back next month.  I'm nervous about the job, as it's a cold-calling and lead generation job.  And I could go for a pizza.  Feel free to say "no", RAOP. Or say nothing! Or just wish me good luck on my new job, for hopefully soon I can afford my own pizza! And IDEALLY, pizza for others, too!
1	Before I begin I would like to apologize for this being a new account. I have been lurking reddit for years and after finding this subreddit I had to make an account. I am a single mother who is not starving but after the father of my children left us we have been living off rice, beans, and oatmeal. It would really help lift our spirits if we could have a special meal tonight for a change. PM me if you want any details. Thanks!  Edit:MisterGrizzly sent me a dominos gift card. Thank you so much for the generosity! 
1	Have one pack of Ramen in the cupboard with a can of re fried beans. Willing to trade some design work for hot pizza pie, take a look at my work.

0	Haven't been getting many hours at work, and getting the hours I do get cut. Don't have money to pay my bills or even my rent due next week. I've been eating mostly cereal and pasta, which is almost gone. I would love something different. Pizza sounds amazing. Please and thank you everyone!
0	I lost my wallet Tuesday. I am unable to get cash from the bank because they are a credit union located in another city three hours away (my hometown). I have to wait for a new debit card to come in the mail. Should be any day now, but in the meantime I would love a hot pizza. I can only eat what's left in the house, and I'm running out quickly. I would love to pay it forward once I get my card in the mail. Can someone help me out please? 
0	Orgo and Ecology Exams tomorrow. Pretty much broke at this point and haven't had a pizza in weeks. Would love a random pizza donator to help us out over here.
0	I just switched to direct deposit and apparently it won't clear until after midnight tonight :(  My car broke down last week so I had to shell out a ton of money on it and was really counting on my pay to be here. I've never struggled to feed my daughter and I'm feeling awful and like a bad mother right now so I told my friend and she told me she'd help if she had the cash but recommended that I ask you guys. I've never really used reddit before but she swears I'm going to be addicted lol. Anyhow, I'll be on here for at least the next several hours while I'm at my desk, hoping for an answer! Here's a pic of me and my daughter : http://postimage.org/image/e4ux9nzet/  Edit: I'm in Dale City, Virginia. I know Domino's can do online orders so people from anywhere in the US can probably send, thanks so much!
0	I haven't had any work for close to two weeks now, its been rough and I have been cooped up in the house, I told my brother about reddit and this subreddit, he told me to give it a try. Just throwing this out there, I plan on repaying the favor when I get to work again.  Thanks
0	I really hate to do this. I am not the type of person to ask people for help...ever. However, I am 21 years old and I live on my own. I make minimum wage and I always make sure to pay all of my bills on time. Unfortunately, once all my bills are paid...there is not always money left over for food. I'm not exactly sure how this all works but I thought it was worth a try. I don't get paid again until next Thursday but I will survive if I don't get a pizza. I have 0$ to my name but it is not a big deal because I don't drive or anything. So really all I need is a little bit of food. If someone would be willing to help me out that would be awesome and I would be totally willing to pay it forward to someone else in need in the future when I am able to. Thanks for reading this. This is a humbling experience!Oh yeah and by the way I do it all on my own with no government assistance and have been since I was 17 years old. Not sure if that really makes a difference or not...
0	Hey guys - my stomach has been meat/fish/animal free for 6 months. I used to crush pepperoni pizza like it was nothing. Ever since I've been doing the vegetarian thing, I haven't had any sort of pizza whatsoever.  So I'm asking if anyone can hook me up with a delicious vegetarian friendly pizza. I'd be forever grateful. (LA, West Hollywood)
0	Was hoping one of you kind folks would be willing to help out a suddenly-depressed college kid. Just walked out of an Accounting Final that went pretty bad. On top of that, I was supposed to get my check for next term's financial aid this week, but won't be getting it until April 2. Anything at all would be amazing.
1	I've been having a hard time recently and I'm unemployed but I'm not eligible for any welfare because I'm not British. I'm hardly managing to pay my rent and gas bills and it's freezing up her right now. Some pizza would go a long way tonight. I don't believe in karma, but I will pay it forward.   I'll answer any questions here.   Thanks. 
0	Hi fellow pizza lovers. I stumbled across this subreddit at work today, and holy wow. This is the best thing I've seen in awhile. My boyfriend and I are both government workers who just bought a house. A house, you say! Why, you are a plethora of good tidings and joy! Well, while that is true, we are also supremely poor because of it. We've been saving for a long time to acquire this house, and while it rules, we haven't purchased anything awesome for a long, long time (and will continue on this path until either magic or raises happen. I, personally, have my eyes on magic). Spaghetti (cheapest. food. ever. still delicious. how does it happen?) every night and PB &amp; J every afternoon. I'm not complaining. Definitely used to it at this point. We just miss pizza! We miss it so! Regardless of the outcome of this request, I still think this is the coolest idea in the world, and hope that many might profit from its supreme and magnanimous awesomeness. Oh yeah! We're in Pittsburgh, PA
0	I have no particular need for a free pizza. I just have a want. I can afford a pizza and don't have any children or other dependants, besides my turtle Donny, who will get a pepperoni if a pizza should be bestowed upon us.   I just like pizza and like the idea of receiving a free pizza via some random person. I suppose it would be proper of me to reciprocate in the future, and who knows, maybe I will.   Cheers
1	Hello, RAoP. Long time lurker, occasional commenter, first time poster.  In any case finals are looming in on me and, while I certainly have a chance to kick their ass and earn myself a 3.0 GPA this semester, I am still nervous. It is for this reason why I am requesting a pizza-- to have a little motivation and something delicious to eat while studying.  I will have money come in at the end of the month, so when that time comes I should be able to pay it forward. Thanks so much for your consideration. :)  edit: I made a typo I hadn't realized until now.... I corrected it though! :3  EDIT2: KYLE-BROFLOSKI has went above and beyond for me and ordered a lot more than I had requested! Thank you so much!!
0	Im out of options and really could use the help.. im broke until friday and will repay/pay it forward. I haven't been this desperate before.
0	Local delivery is Dominos. I don't have a big appetite either. I'll probably end up gifting some pizza on here in the future, because I think everybody just needs pizza sometimes.
1	I've been pretty broke lately due to some circumstances I'd rather not get into. I haven't had anything to eat today, and I'm pretty much out of food until Monday when I get paid. I could really use a pizza if anyone doesn't mind.
0	My girlfriend isn't having the best day. What would really help is if some one would help me get her a stuffed crust pizza that would make her day!  *edit: I am in the Tucson, Arizona area.
1	Tomorrow I am moving home and it is a scrape to do but for health reasons I have to move away from this particular home. I have no money to buy food until Thursday (I get paid then).  Hopefully someone will be able to help me out tonight if not then thanks anyway.   Sadly getting to the point where I only have a couple hours left to do anything ( I have to get to bed early ish so I can get up early to move. If I can get anyone to help in the next 2 hours or 3 that would be awesome.   Well thanks anyways guys :). It was a long shot but thanks. Even though I didnt get pizza's it dont matter 
0	I just graduated from university and have little disposable income for eating out. I have been in the mood for pizza for a few days now and heard this was the place to come. Thanks! 
1	We've been living together for a couple months since moving out due to conflict with our family and we haven't had much variety except for changing up ramen flavors. We would just love to enjoy some pizza for our Saturday dinner. We would be very appreciative of such a gesture. Thanks for looking.
0	Hi... I am new to this, so I hope I am doing it right. I live in central FL. My husband and I have 3 young children. My husband is a local truck driver and I am a stay-at-home mom. A couple months ago our roof decided to start leaking, right in to our bedroom. Insurance isn't covering it because the roof is old. We are trying to save to repair the roof and replace the drywall that was damaged. Since that time, things have continued to spiral downward. I don't want to be long winded, but it has gone so far that we have had to apply for foodstamps and medicaid because I have 2 have surgery and a diagnostic procedure to rule out cervical cancer. My husband's wages have been cut because the runs just aren't there. We are struggling and the only way that we have had any food for the past couple of weeks is because of my parents. I have been looking for a job, but I have had no success. We are even having to sell our electronics on craigslist to try and get some money to survive. It has been very stressful and frustrating for us and I know our kids can tell that something is wrong. I was hoping that someone might be willing to give us just one bright spot in this dark time. Thanks for taking the time to read all of this. Blessings to you all. :0)
0	I'm crazy broke. Payed on Friday. Can pay back or forward. Dominoes is the cheapest in my area.
0	Hi raop, I'm installing pannels in my room and it's not as easy as I thought, especially that I'm really tired after studying pretty hard for my last exam that takes place next week. If I get good grade (A), I will get scholarship that I need really bad. I was studying for 3 days straight, 2 more are ahead of me. I am very hungry and I don't really know what to eat - I don't want to ask my mom for money because she invested so much in my room lately that it can look as I wanted. Any help appreciated. [Pic of my cat helping me with the floor, her name is Tequila, sorry for quality of that photo, it was taken with my phone.](http://imgur.com/uAa1I)
1	STILL waiting for my unemployment check and my daughter has officially called a strike on ramen and (surprisingly) Mac and Cheese.  I have already had to get TP in unconventional ways today. All I would like is a pizza to help relax and put a smile on the little brats face for once this week.   If anyone can throw one our way I would appreciate it. Once I get my check I will return the favor to this subreddit! (hopefully in the next century)  EDIT: I just realized there was a verification process. I did take a picture with my daughter holding my user name.  http://imgur.com/XASQc  Thanks so much!
1	Blasting music and hungry :(
0	Like I said I just got a new camper and payday for both of us isn't until next week. anything would help!!  thanks
0	Most weeks I am really lucky to make it from paycheck to paycheck.  Usually I am broke by Thursday though.  This week is really bad, my mother has fallen on really bad times.  Mom got a foreclosure letter, myself and my sister stepped up and pulled together some money to keep mom in her house at least one more month.  Now I'm in trouble, I gave away all my food money and I haven't told my kids or my husband, I know I'm going to have to and I will but as of right now my kids are home from school and my husband will be home around 6:30 and I have no food and no money to get anything for dinner.  I promise that I will pay it forward next week if someone has it in their heart to help me out tonight.    Location, Kansas
0	Paid rent to my roommate for the first, no paycheck until Friday! Could really use a Domino's gift card, there is a Domino's down the street from me...will pay it forward this coming Friday now that rent is taken care of!
0	Hey guys. I wanted to see how this works out. I just paid off my tuition for this college semester, so I definitely don't have the money for a pizza. :(  Anyone willing to help me out? :3  Gah, forgot location: Ellicott City, Maryland, USA, Earth, This Solar System, This Galaxy, This Universe.
0	Sitting around playing pokemon emerald, thought that a pizza would be really nice right around now. I live in the Utah Valley area, if you are interested
0	I'm out of cash, and only have $1.38 in SNAP benefits left. Anything would be great. 
0	I know there's probably nowhere open at this hour, but if someone does know, all I need to know is where and if they deliver.
0	Hey i have never used this before but have no money so thought i would give it a try. I would really love to have a pizza right now. And would appreciate someone to buy me one. Then i will owe you a favour. lol 
0	I'm quite poor at the moment, I still owe my brother for rent, and I could really use a pizza if at all possible. I can draw somewhat well, so I'd be willing to trade a digital sketch or something for some 'za. Please and thanks!
0	I have been stuck inside my room all day because I had a huge, blow-out fight with my roommate and I don't want to see him. I have no food here and also no money, and can't leave because I have nowhere to go and there is a thunderstorm outside. I have received a pizza before, a couple months ago, and also given one in /r/Food_Pantry. I have $6.30 in PayPal also if someone would like to trade. Thanks for reading!
0	Let me know if you want to make a new friend too.
0	http://i.imgur.com/DxyE3.jpg
1	I'm in the US. Money is super tight and my soon to be 2 yr old keeps asking for pizza (peet-zee). Her b-day is tomorrow (9/27) and i'd really like to surprise her with some pizza. I can provide cell phone pics of my family (2 toddlers, 2 adults) eating the pizza afterward. :D  EDIT: Recieved an egiftcard thanks hearip88!
0	Here's the deal. I have $-3.80 in my bank account (damn sallie mae) and all I have to eat until I go home for easter on Wednesday is three boxes of spegetti which I would like to make last. If someone would be awesome enough to get me a pizza I promise to return the favor (pizza of equal value). All I am looking for is a $5 pizza from my local 24 hour Domino's. 
0	Canadian post-grad here, I don't really want to get into too much detail about myself suffice to say that I have bills racked up that I need to pay and no job to pay for them, increasingly falling into debt and I know it's crazy but I've been prioritizing paying down my student loans than feeding myself. I'm not sure how much longer I can go on like this, I've lost a lot of weight over the past few months and things just keep getting worse. If my father was still alive I'm sure I wouldn't need to ask for this help, but in the current financial state my mother is in I cannot ask her for help (she would help me, but then she would have nothing to eat, maybe even lose her house).  I feel disgusted with myself that it has come to this, my self esteem isn't usually this low but with everything the way it is, it's hard to feel good about myself.
0	I have never used RAOP before, but a redditor friend of mine told me about it and to try it out sometime when food is low.
0	Just graduated school and am looking for a job I can hopefully call my career. Any help would be greatly appreciated and I will definitely pay it forward!
0	It would be amazingly appreciated and make both of our days. Will provide verification code if requested.
0	I'm a 3rd year illustration student in Swansea, UK and my dissertation (final 8k word essay) is due in just over a week! Have been stressing a lot about it and really don't fancy cooking for my boyfriend and I tonight (we'd only be having tuna sprouty jacket potatoes anyway as its all we've got until march 12th payday!) He also had most of his tool kit stolen yesterday (he's a mechanic) and its really getting him down.  can provide proof of sprouting potato-ownership, proof of half empty tool box, screenshots of half finished dissertation, photos of stressed me/pile of books and screenshots of $20 bank balance!  will pass pizza-love on as soon as I am paid, because we all know pizza runs the universe.
1	I recently graduated from UC San Diego with a BA in theater and now I'm trying to break into the industry in LA. I've been here for 6 months now and have had some luck with odd jobs, but no steady work. A pizza for my GF and I would be greatly appreciated.
0	Four of us are trying to find some food for tonight with out empty wallets. If its possible, we'd love to accept someone's nice warm pizza.  We live in a suburb of Chicago, close to plenty of franchises, and little pizza joints as well. If anyone is feeling generous tonight, please PM me.  Thanks  -- llanox
0	Hey guys, long time lurker who wishes she could contribute but never has the money. :( Hoping someone out there can ease the wait to get my school refund with a nice hot pizza. I'm in the Winter Park area of Orlando, any other details will be provided via private message. Thank you for those that read this, even if you do not contribute. 
1	I forgot my dinner at home and I'm working a 13 hour graveyard shift at a hospital, would love to be able to eat something so I'm not exhausted and starving :)
0	I'm just a student with (apparently) terrible money management, but I have no monies or food :( A pizza would be much appreciated!
0	Hey, we just got home, we are tired, hungry and my Mom is out working late. There is nothing in the fridge, I get paid tomorrow and I swear I will pay it forward. Thanks so much!
0	I've been living on my friends couch while I try to find work. I hate mooching, which is what I've been doing for most of the past month. Tonight, my friend and his girl will be out for a while and I would love to have a nice pizza waiting for them when they get back as a thank you for all they have done for me. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
0	I moved to nyc for the summer in order to complete an digital effects internship and am currently working that and 2 other jobs waiting tables/bar backing in order to stay afloat. This city has been tearing me apart financially on top of my college loans and I would greatly appreciate the help of ROAP to help fill my belly with delicious pizza as opposed to the ramen noodles and cheese sandwiches I've become accustom to. 
0	Hey guys, sorry to come in my first time with a really, really depressing post. I was actually introduced to this place a month or so ago and was planning on having my first entry be a 3-pizza giveaway once I got my financial aid in, but I could really use the tiniest bit of support right now.  I just got the news that my grandfather had his ventilator removed and normally I think I'd be fine with dealing with this, but I think it's because I'm by myself in my apartment (my friends all have plans) and most of my family is up in Jersey to say goodbye, I'm having a rough time. As I'm said, I'm new, and don't quite know how to verify this, but heck, I'll take some kind comments at the very least. Seems like a very loving subreddit, so I suppose I'm just looking for a support outlet somewhere.  Thanks, guys.  EDIT: Orlando, Florida. Sorry, forgot to put that in the title.
0	I just moved into a new apartment, and I'm really strapped for cash until the end of this week, when my new job starts up. Not only that, but school will be starting in 2 weeks, and I'm sure once that happens I won't get the chance to relax a whole lot either. I'll be sure to pay if forward once I get some money, as well, so I'm not being a total bum. Thanks!
1	This has been a hard week. I don't want to bore you with details, but I'd like to smile and believe there's still good people willing to do good things. I'd love to pay it forward after Friday. Thank you.
0	List of things I will do for a pizza.  1. Anything I would do for a klondike bar 2. upvote anything you want me to 3. send an email to your ex gf/bf telling them to fuck off. 4. thank you alot. 5. be your friend. 6. eat the pizza. 7. enjoy the pizza. 8. BE the pizza.
0	...I've spent my weekly allowance on other necessities like bed sheets, toilet paper, etc. I had enough money left over to have food the day before yesterday. I didn't mind not eating yesterday since I was asleep due to the exhaustion from moving.   I daren't ask my parents for money because I know money is very tight and being the over loving parents that they are, they'd stop eating for a week if it means I'm comfortable and I just cannot do that to them. If anyone is willing to send me a pizza, then great. If not, then thanks for actually reading all this :)  I'm in Bristol btw  Thanks
0	I have not had much to eat in the last couple of days because my stores have run out. I spent the last of my money on dog food before I get paid in a few days because Marley needs to eat more than I do. I would appreciate a pizza so much, I usually conserve my money better than this but I really failed this month. I swear to repay the favor when I'm in better financial standing. Thank you very much.
